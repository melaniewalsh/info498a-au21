EcoBuckeye,2021-08-20 10:48:01+00:00,"Moving my child from an anti-vax, anti-mask teacher - it's medical discrimination?","In Ohio. My 10-year-old is returning to school for the first time since March 2020. We elected to enroll him in virtual school for the 2020-2021 school year. [EDIT RIGHT HERE - virtual was last year. This year is 2021-2022 school year.] When researching his assigned teacher for this new year in-school, we've discovered she has multiple public posts on social media claiming that the covid vaccine is a lie, it kills people, etc.; that she is against masks and children need to be freed from wearing masks; and, that she is card-carrying, medically exempt from wearing a mask (shared in the context of being refused service at a local establishment).

Upon learning this publicly-available information shared by the teacher, I emailed the principal and requested that he be moved to a different class before the start of the school year. The principal has refused, saying that our request amounts to medical discrimination against that teacher. Masks and vaccinations are not required in this district.

Is it, in fact, medical discrimination to ask for my child to be moved to a different room if I have concerns that a teacher will not adequately protect them during this pandemic? How will I know if she is being safe, will she stay home if she feels ill? Monitor her temperature daily? Provide periodic negative tests? Am I even allowed to ask these questions of her (I do think it's important to emphasize that she has shared this information freely and publicly on social media). I will continue to push for what I think is best for my child, but now that the discrimination word has been used, I need to tread very lightly.

EDIT2: Thank you all for the replies. I do not intend to discuss the pros and cons of vaccines and masks, whether I am scared or brave, or any other opinions on the validity or foolishness of my family's response to the pandemic. There are plenty of other threads where you can challenge me on that, but I won't be responding to those in this context on this sub. I am only curious if I am, in fact, being discriminatory, and the consensus appears to be that I am not.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/p82rgx/moving_my_child_from_an_antivax_antimask_teacher/,legaladvice,1198,179,0.0
CarefulGiraffe7673,2021-06-17 02:58:11+00:00,girl who bullied me in middle school and high school found out where I work and won't stop harassing me.,"this is in MI. This girl in particular made my life a living hell when I was in middle school and continued the bullying and harassment even when I went to another high school on the other side of the school district. She has now found out where I work and will not stop harassing me on my linkedin and other social media and keeps prank calling my office to the point where I'm scared I'm going to lose my job. I need some advice.

We are both in our late 20s (I will be 28 in a few months). This person would spread rumors about me having a penis and being transgendered or gay and both physically and verbally bullied me in middle school up until my senior year of high school. She would throw things at me when I was walking down the hall and even pushed me down the stairs once (which I got in trouble for because the hall monitor thought I was 'fooling around' and I almost got suspended for it (?)). She made up a derogatory name for me (it was a play on words of my name and a derogatory slur for homosexual people) and would shout it in the hall all the time and even etched it into my locker which I also got into a lot of trouble for.

obviously there is nothing wrong with being gay and there is nothing wrong with being transgender but it obviously was still name calling and harassment (this took place back in 2006 for those who are wondering). The school didn't do anything about it and my parents didn't care.

When I was in high school, she made a fake facebook profile for me and would post links to porn websites (and made them public) and would photoshop photos of me on there and would keep doing it no matter how many times I blocked her. I tried numerous times to get facebook to get the page taken down and they wouldn't do it. What's also funny was that this girl wasn't super popular or anything. She was part of the emo/scene/art clique or group or whatever in school.

I finally never heard from her again after I started college up until this point. Apparently she is some kind of graphic designer in our hometown. Beginning late last week, she has been \*67 calling my phone, left numerous bad reviews about me on the google reviews page of the agency I work at, wont stop messaging me on linkedin and now is prank calling my office. I knew it was her because I was called downstairs by the secretary and she mentioned the caller and that they were asking if (insert derogatory name she called me here) worked here and that she didn't know that my place of employment hired transgender people. My heart sank when the secretary told me that this is the 10th time that they have called this week. I'm now worried about losing my job over this and I have no idea what to do.

_morgarita_,2021-06-15 16:10:15+00:00,My new apartment has a squatter and the complex won’t respond to my attempts at contact.,"I recently signed my very first apartment lease  (with my live in boyfriend) after touring a local complex and deciding that it seemed like a clean, safe place to live. 

However, the morning we got our keys and went to check out our new place, the window next to ours was shattered and that unit seemed to be somewhat ransacked. So we called our main office and reported it, (they didn’t answer so we left a message) then went to enter our own unit. When we did, we found the door already unlocked and the interior in a state of disrepair. There’s dirt and spiderwebs everywhere, along with cigarette butts all over the carpets and ash scattered around. There were half empty cans of food in the fridge and cabinets, and a disgusting trash bag full of old food, more cigarette butts, and a plethora of bugs that were slowly taking over everything. But the scariest part was a few pillows set up like a sleeping mat next to a fan in the bedroom. Those are only a few of the issues with the unit. 

We contacted the office immediately, when they failed to respond again we left a message. Since then we have called multiple times, sent emails, and put in a work order to have the unit cleaned.  It’s now been over a week and a half and we still haven’t gotten any sort of response.  I am panicking. I am a college student and I can’t really afford to pay the fee to cancel the lease, especially after just having paid all the moving fees. 

Is there any legal action I can take against this place?

EDIT: This is in Columbia, SC

EDIT 2: Thank you so much to everyone offering advice regarding school/student legal aide. However, unfortunately this complex is it’s own business and has no ties to any school housing.

K_NurseRN,2021-06-15 14:33:53+00:00,Sexual Assault by Patient at Workplace,"Missouri

I posted this incident on my nursing subreddit for suggestions on how I should handle this situation and many have responded to take legal action against my workplace. Could this be a possible case - 

I’m an RN on a behavioral health unit and have recently been sexually assaulted by a patient while being their 1:1. I was the FOURTH female staff member to be assaulted. There’s MULTIPLE documentations of the patient stating they will continue to sexually assault any female staff and in every huddle it’s been verbally warned that this patient should technically be a 2:1 but isn’t able to be due to lack of staffing. This patient has no psychosis, nor has any diagnosis other than depression. They are in full control of their behavior and competent. After the incident, I was told to switch assignments with another female staff member. I had to advocate that this would be highly inappropriate to put another female staff member as the patients 1:1. I understand there are certain risks involved with working in psych, but this incident, along with many others could have been avoided by proper intervention by management. I’m okay, and not worried about myself, but am angry that management isn’t bothered, or taking seriously, that 4 of their female staff members have gotten their crotches grabbed and fondled. Does anybody have any similar incidences or suggestions on ways I can make a difference or positive change? I’m tired of letting these incidences slide under the table.

Each one of us filed a report to press charges against the patient. But the cop told us nothing would likely come from it as judges will most likely look at it as “a risk of our job.” We all still followed through and filed a report. 

My unit also has full surveillance so all these assaults have been caught on camera as well.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/o0fs8f/sexual_assault_by_patient_at_workplace/,legaladvice,1331,148,0.0
Stalking-Throwaway42,2021-06-14 22:19:27+00:00,My girlfriend is being aggressively stalked and harassed by the (recent) wife of an old ex boyfriend,"I'm a bit shaken up by what's taken place over the last 24 hours and as such might be a bit sloppy on some of the details. If it's obvious  that I've left out an important detail, please let me know. For context, we're in the United States. Our state is Missouri, the stalker's state is Tennessee. 

Starting several months back, my girlfriend started receiving ""ghost"" message notifications through Snapchat. That is, she was receiving notifications that someone was typing to her, but failing to press send. This happened for days. She did a bit of research on the name and found that this woman was her ex boyfriend's new wife. She dated this guy from her mid-early teens to her mid 20s; they've been apart for a little more than 5 years now if I'm not mistaken. She has no contact with him, aside from a text from several months back where he asked her for the contact information of an acquaintance. The ex boyfriend is, as far as I've heard, a solid and nice guy. The split was amicable.

Following the Snapchat weirdness that I described above, my girlfriend (I'm going to call her Anna) began hearing about similar behavior targeted at old friends. This woman has been targeting multiple people; anyone and everyone that she believes has had contact or relationships (friendly or otherwise) with her new husband. Anna kept me apprised of the situation and I've been assuring her that this chick is just crazy and she has nothing to worry about. Anna moved to the other side of the country several years back (where she met me!) and has little to no connection with her old state. Her whole immediate family lives in my state now.

Last month, Anna received a text message from her ex boyfriend. He began the conversation by asking her if she'd received any weird messages or calls from his wife, and went on to explain that she has been stealing his phone and harassing every female contact in it. Old friends, girlfriends, etc. He apologized to Anna for the ""ghost"" messages on Snapchat and told her that other people were getting it far worse from his wife. The conversation lasted a few minutes, ended, and then Anna told me. Again, I assured her she didn't have anything to worry about.

Fast forward to last night. Anna and I are having a gaming night and Anna is streaming on Twitch. Anna starts receiving follow/unfollow messages from an account with the name of this guy's wife. She then begins receiving full blown text messages from this woman. The first message contains a 7 year old half-nude picture of Anna, followed by demands that she ""step out of their lives"" and stop tempting her new husband. Anna is absolutely freaked out. Where did this woman get a 7 year old nude picture from? Why is she messaging her? Why does she think Anna is in any way involved with her husband? I advised her not to respond.

It got worse this morning. Following a bout of early morning phone calls from this woman (which she was careful not to answer) Anna's family members are now receiving social media friend requests (primarily Instagram) from an account impersonating Anna. The profile picture is the 7 year old nude mentioned above. Anna's younger sister, Britany, informed her roughly an hour ago. Her mom and brother have also received friend requests from this profile.

The fake profile contains personal information about Anna. Her cellphone number, her Twitch ID, email, Skype (which she hasn't used in years), etc. Anything and everything that this woman could find.

I feel terrible. I told her to just leave it alone, and now it's escalated to the point of instilling fear and panic. Anna has had no contact (aside from what I described above) with her old ex and this woman has absolutely no reason to believe that anything is going on. Her behavior seems unhinged. I want to put a swift end to this and I'd be grateful for any and all advice. We've reported the fake Instagram profile. What else can we do? Should I call the police in her old state? Have any obvious laws been broken?",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/nzynfa/my_girlfriend_is_being_aggressively_stalked_and/,legaladvice,1388,155,0.0
TuctDape,2021-06-14 11:53:31+00:00,"Landlord failed to notify us about complex bike rack clearning, likely got our bikes thrown out.","**Edit: There's new information at the bottom of the post.**

Massachusetts

Our condo complex where we rent a unit has a couple bike sheds with racks where we keep our bikes. On Sunday we went to go for a ride, and found that the entire rack had been cleared out, and our bikes were gone.

I texted our LL, who normally forwards emails from the property company/condo association to us and asked if there had been any emails regarding bikes recently. He replied that he found an email from the 10th that he missed, and forwarded it to us. 

It stated that it was a 'Reminder to claim bikes by the 11th', and any bikes that have not been removed will be considered abandoned and disposed of. He eventually found another email he missed from June 4th.

We tried contacting the property company and the condo association but no one was around because it was Sunday, we're going to try today to see if there's any chance the bikes haven't yet been trashed, but I'm not optimistic.

The bikes are fairly new, cost $1100 combined last year. If we can't get them back we plan on requesting that the landlord compensate us for the value of the bikes since it was clearly his fault. 

I'm wondering what our options are if the LL pushes back on this? He's been a good enough LL so far, has acted quickly to fix issues with heating/water/etc... but this is the first case where it's not clearly his obligation so we're not sure how he'll react.

So far he's only said that ""he didn't know we had bikes"" and that he ""he's sorry he didn't see the emails"", we haven't mentioned anything about asking for compensation yet.


**Update Edit**: 2PM Update, the property company claims they did not remove or dispose of any bikes, that they merely moved and non-locked bikes to the outside of the shed, and left any locked ones where they were, despite their emails claiming they would remove them.

I think they are essentially saying the bikes were stolen, and that we should file a police report, but I want to get that explicitly. The landlord told me over the phone that he would help compensate, I told him that I was going to try to get renter's insurance to pay, and he offered to pay the deductible, I'm going to get that in written form ASAP.

I'm still not convinced that the property company has it's story straight, the woman who is listed as the contact in the original emails is on vacation for a week.

**Second Update**: The company continues to say that they only moved unlocked bikes outside the shed, and didn't touch any of the locked ones (which ours were). So basically now I don't think we will get much more progress from the company about it. They are going to send out a notice, and are going to see if the security cameras reveal anything (they don't point at the shed, only really the driveway of the property).

So unless we can find proof or something that the company is not being truthful, we will have to proceed under the assumption that the bikes were stolen.

The path forward seems to be filing a renters insurance claim once I get a police report filed tomorrow. I'm going to go to the bike shop and get a physical receipt for the used bike and see if I can get a quote from them about the current value of the bikes for when I file my claim.

Landlord offered to pay for the deductible and has been generally helpful.

I still find it incredible suspicious that the company *said* they were going to take any bikes left there, the bikes are all gone, but they claim to not have actually gone through with it. Again, just a suspicion that I have no proof for.

The only other explanation I can think of is that the property manager who is currently on vacation made some arrangement with a trash removal company or something to come and remove the bikes, but the current people filling in didn't know about it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/nzl2nn/landlord_failed_to_notify_us_about_complex_bike/,legaladvice,1801,170,1.0

A little context: I've been renting this house for over 5+ years and there have never been any problems whatsoever. All payments have been made on time, I've attempted to fix vital services when necessary to make it more convenient for the landlord, etc.

A few days ago, my landlord suddenly leaves a paper (not face to face) message demanding I vacate within the next few weeks. Considering it is their property, I did not argue it and claimed I'd start looking immediately and update them.

Fast forward to yesterday, my landlord is waiting outside my door, screaming at me demanding I hand in my keys already because she ""has renovations to complete and I'm causing her to lose money"".

throwaway_94500,2021-03-05 02:45:22+00:00,"My broker triggered a ""margin call"" on an account not trading on margin, due to a series of mistakes they themselves acknowledged. They are refusing compensation due to it being ""too big of a position"" despite this acknowledgement.","Location: New Jersey (This is for LocationBot, my location shouldn't be relevant outside of being within the US.)

Here is the series of system mistakes leading to this error.  

1. Having made substantial gains, I took some profits and made a few transfers from my primary account to a linked secondary account. Primary account is margin approved but doesn't have a single margined position, I never use margin despite being approved for it.

2. After a few transfers I notice the money is being put into the secondary account but not being removed from the primary account. At this point I assume this is just due to high network load and don't touch a penny of the transferred funds, expecting them to get rolled back after the system synchronized.

3. A couple hours later and still no change, but now I am facing a Reg-T margin call. While this makes no sense to me, I begin to grow concerned they ""fixed"" their error by pulling from margin, and so sell some nonmarginable securities I had no intention of selling in order to cover this amount.

4. Within minutes the margin call has now increased several orders of magnitude. It is also now becoming more likely to me that they indeed just used margin to fix their error, obviously an internal cash transfer is not even a marginable security.

5. At this point I decide to go into the secondary account and try just sending it back to cover this now quite large margin call. The initial problem has now entirely reversed, with money leaving my secondary account but never arriving in my main account. The money was ""returned"" through two separate sales, both of which were acknowledged as sent by the broker but seemingly disappearing into thin air.

6. Within minutes of the second transfer, which was enough to fully cover the margin call and only necessary due to their own error in the first place, they execute a margin call on my main account.

Having spoken to support, this was acknowledged by their margin team as an error on their end, and I also learned that the ""disappearing"" transfers was due to being flagged for further review because apparently it exceeded some maximum number of transfers. Initially the guy seemed very confident that this could be reversed, but ended up returning after 30 mins on hold by saying his superiors couldn't do anything. Why? Because the position was too big, as though their mistake is somehow my responsibility.

So first they pull from margin to ""fix"" their own error that should have prevented the transfer to start with. I never spent a penny of this money after seeing the mistake and further fully covered the bogus margin call in time. This didn't matter though due to yet another mistake on their system, flagging it for further review which prevented me from being able to avoid being margin called.

* This is a major international brokerage that just about anyone in North America would recognize the name of. No, it is not RH.
* I have made transfers before where I didn't have enough cash, whether due to unsettled funds or fat fingering the amount, and has always thrown an error as it should. You can't under any normal circumstances borrow money on margin to send to another account, and this is obvious just looking at what qualifies as a marginable security.
* I did absolutely nothing with the money after seeing the mistake and did everything within my power to rectify it, only to be thwarted by yet another system error.
* While I won't share the exact dollar amount, the option they liquidated has an underlying value in the 7 figures. My immediate losses alone from these series of errors are substantial and I would need to increase my cost basis by an order of magnitude buying it back now.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/ly24to/my_broker_triggered_a_margin_call_on_an_account/,legaladvice,2564,35,0.0

This just happened yesterday and I  just wanted some opinions on it, I'm already looking into a lawyer as I only have 20 days before my Civil case. My mother left her property to me and my brother after she passed. When she died I had just turned 18 and my brother was 12 . I couldn't care for him so he went to live with my mother's best friends and they became his legal guardians. They tried to force me to sell as soon as they took him in by suing me for his half. My grandma and my father helped me fight them and it never happened. 
Now he's about to be 18 in a few days so they filed right before his 18th birthday stating I damaged them and want his portion of the property which would be $150,000.
We also have a billboard being rented on the property that has been paying the taxes for the last 9 years or so. I've used cashier checks to pay it every time since my mother died. They are suing for half of the billboard as well as back pay for the last 4 years which would roughly be $10,000. They are stating since the billboard is legally under my name that I damaged my brother by not giving him his share even if it was under my name before my mother's death. 
I never asked them or my brother to pay half of the taxes because we verbally agreed that the billboard would cover it and it always has covered the taxes only leaving maybe a couple dollars which are still in the savings account for the next payment of the taxes that are due. This section confuses me however because they never paid a dime for the taxes, I'm unsure how'd they'd be able to sue for that if they never contributed to the taxes. 
I just want to know the likelihood of being forced to sell. As my brother will be 18 before the trial happens, I am sure he won't see his money because they filed as his guardians and not with my brother's knowledge. I don't want my brother to lose his inheritance as soon as he hits adulthood. If my brother was the one wanting to sell I'd have no issue with it but he isn't suing me it's his guardians.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/lxlc7e/my_brothers_guardians_are_attempting_to_sue_me/,legaladvice,2837,120,0.0

When I found out that the dentist operated beside a church on a trailer I began having doubts. This dentist explained that he had a clinic but only used the trailer on the weekends. When it was time for my teeth to be x-rayed the equipment didn't work because of ""internet failure."" Turns out he was using the church internet. I made the decision not to go back again. A few months pass, and on a whim I decided to check my insurance. While perusing through my insurance, I noticed that I was charged for unrelated services regarding my last dental visit. I was charged for x-ray which I know didn't happen because his equipment didn't work. The most he did was clean my teeth and he charged 150 for that which I was fine with. I went to the facebook page of his clinic and found that other people were also complaining of overcharging. Obviously unhappy I left a negative review saying that I had a bad experience and that he was overcharging. I also contacted my insurance to look into the charges made.

In the same day I called my insurance for a follow up and they told me that when they asked the dentist to provide proof of why he charged for that particular service he could not provide any. I would like to know if I am going to be a prospective homeless person in the coming months.

madhatr,2021-02-25 14:48:19+00:00,Can I sue my neighbor for causing a sinkhole under my house?,"So a year ago I moved to Florida. Not knowing the area well we didn't want to move across the country into a neighborhood we didn't know. We settled on buying a manufactured home in a lot. We payed $70,000 cash for a 2016 home so we could settle in and find the home we wanted before dropping $300,000 on a traditional house or land to build our own. We have never lived in a home where we didn't own the land.

So after hurricane ETA came through the fence between our house and the apartment complex directly behind us started falling over. The fence is owned by the apartment complex. By the time they were done removing the old fence on December 10th they had also removed 5 tree's that came with our property, our backyard is now all sand and there is a large ditch where the fence was. The contractors they hired pulled no permits and did not have the city mark pipes and cables. In turn they cut through cable lines, broke water pipes and plugged up the drainage pipe that was in the ditch.

All of this caused our house to start sinking. The ground is wavy and are backyard is basically quicksand. We thankfully have sinkhole insurance on our homeowners policy. We called the insurance company out. They looked it over, said it showed the signs of a sinkhole. They then sent out a geological engineer. He could not run all the test because the company that owns the land would not respond to their requests for permission to take soil samples and sonar on the ground. He did say that the middle of the house is a inch higher than the backside of the house. He also told us that the yard is a hazard.

The land owners now 2 months later gave verbal approval to take samples. Now they have to wait on written approval. The manager of the park refuses to respond to any emails about the land.

If the insurance company finds enough damage to total the house they will pay out $66,000. Otherwise they will try and repair the sinkhole and house. We are scared to stay here and refuse to live on the same land. Even a fixed sinkhole greatly devalues our house. Legally you have to disclose if a sinkhole, even a repaired one ever existed. 

Do I have a case against the apartment complex? They dinged our insurance which will rase rates, they devalued our house, we will have to pay $1000 deductible on the house, and they have trapped us in a sinking house scared for our lives for months now.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/ls859a/can_i_sue_my_neighbor_for_causing_a_sinkhole/,legaladvice,3329,127,0.0
Throwaway123ppp,2021-02-25 04:21:00+00:00,Speaking to police about investigation involving deceased son.,"My son passed away two weeks ago. The cause involved fentanyl.  The police contacted me today and wanted to ask me a few questions about it.

 When this incident occured with my son, the police arrived along with the ambulance and I allowed them to search his room.  AFAIK all what the cops took was the drugs that they found.  They handed me a substantial amount of cash they found and a weapon he wasn't legally supposed to have, and ignored some other things in my house that could have gotten me in trouble that my son had brought in.

Considering this, I don't think they are gunning to throw charges at me. My question is should I call them back? I'm the most milquetoast dude you can think of, and all the contraband my son had is out of my house.

1st question is, would this need a legal business permit? I currently live in the UAE and I'm wondering what the legal permits are before we proceed on to this (I don't want to get involved in illegal work for grades)

2nd question is, are they even allowed to force us to start businesses since they are our ""institution"" and it isn't any business with give the price and we'll make a deal, I mean a full on business with giving out RFQ's and etc.

3rd question is, are they allowed to take money from us? They won't be investing any money on it and have just told us to make a business while they can take a 5% tax from us.

4th question is, would this be forced labor on us?

5th question is, IS THIS EVEN LEGAL?

our location is the UAE, Abu Dhabi if that can help.

EDIT: For additional information, our business will be made ourselves with no resourses from the school whatsoever, we also have to create our own website to promote and sell these products and how it's going to be sold is solely up to us.

First things first, I went down to the Chesapeake General District Court on Thursday and filed a civil suit against my roommate for over $2500. I overnighted my copy of the summons to him, and when they arrived on Friday, I slid it under his door since it is technically his mail. Also, when I got home from work last night, I noticed that the sheriff's office had left their copies of the summons attached to the screen door. At the advice of the civil clerk of court, I am not touching it.

I have an update on my car as well. I received a phone call from the collision center yesterday, and my vehicle is ready to be picked up. I am excited that I am going to be back into my own car.

Last, but not least, I am pretty sure that my roommate has moved out early, even though he wasn't due to move out on the first. The only reason I say this is because he hasn't been here in 2 1/2 days, and the security camera he had watching his vehicle is not in his window anymore.

BMOwraps,2021-02-04 16:57:34+00:00,"Probably going to be charged with Interfering in a Police Investigation, what can I expect? [Ohio,USA]","I live on a residential street in Athens Ohio. Since I have moved in, one particular parking enforcement officer has made a habit of trying to ticket cars parked on my street. Here is the relevant law.

**7.05.03. - Continuous parking in same location.**
*No person who is the owner, agent, operator or other person in charge of any vehicle shall permit said vehicle to remain parked, standing or abandoned upon any street for a continuous period longer than 24 hours. This section shall not be construed as affecting any other parking regulation now in effect or that hereafter may become effective but shall be construed as additional parking limitation. The purpose of this section is to prohibit the continuous longtime parking and the storage of vehicles on the streets of the city.* 

This is a very broad law and is obviously not enforced on every single street, mostly just the ones near downtown. They used to draw a chalk mark on your tire to check, but some time ago a law was passed stating that was illegal so they resorted to drawing a chalk mark on the ground at the base of the tire.

Where the issue began is my street USED to have a small goverment office in it years ago, and so they used to be strict on parking, this office hasn't been open in years and is now totally residential, but this one particular parking officer still comes by and marks cars. My roommate 3 different times got ticketed falsely because they would park too close so a chalk mark left for another car, or left for work and parked in the same spot on the street later.

I started talking to neighbors and found out that she was even going after an older couple up the street who have no driveway and have to park on the street. Now they are forced to leave their home and move the car every day just so they dont get blasted with fines.
I think this is wrong, but I'm not here to talk about morals because I know the law doesn't care. I just wanted to provide some backstory as to what I was about to do.

I started erasing the chalk lines on our street after she would come by. Just a little water and a rag and I'd go up the street and erase them all. This actually has gone on for almost 2 years now. She would come by and Id erase everything. Idk what changed but I guess one day she sat and waited somewhere and got a picture of me doing this.

I only found out when I was stopped by a police officer while walking home one day and questioned about it. He took my ID and said that I should be expecting paperwork, which Im guessing is gonna be a summons for a court date.

So Im guessing ill be charged with Interfering in a Police Investigation, but that is a broad charge with broad penalties.

catfood_man_333332,2021-02-03 19:15:05+00:00,"[UPDATE] [CALIFORNIA] Step son's mother relapsed on pills, booze, and marijuana, step son has been left with me. Step son has stated he wants to stay with me and not have contact with his mother. Need help understanding what my rights are and how to protect myself and my step son.","Location is California, [Original Post Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/kzk5vu/california_step_sons_mother_relapsed_on_pills/)

I want to start by saying that the advice/support I got was not expected and much appreciated. It has been a long two weeks.

Quick run-down from previous post: I have custody of my step-son because his mother relapsed, we are not and have not been married, he is saying he wants to stay with me, BIO dad not in the picture in a meaningful way.

This update isn't bad, but it is not ideal. The advice I received was bleek. Never being married to his mother restricts me from certain legal protections that I might enjoy, so the truth is that I will be fighting an uphill battle here.

After meeting with legal counsel, they recommend to not take legal action at this point in time because it is likely to cause volatility and may result in retaliation from his mother. Why did they suggest this? Each lawyer pointed out that the child is in my care and that his mother has willingly let the child *indefinitely* stay with me, at least for now. Moreover, my step-son's mother's Aunt &amp; Grandma are discouraging her from getting him back because she has a terrible track record with sobriety and bringing men around. So while not legally binding, it is at least some pressure for her to leave him with me, and she does seem to be respecting that, whatever the reason.

In the way of legal action, I was told by one attorney that I could petition for guardianship. She said that this is not an easy task, especially because I am not of blood relation to the child. I was told it would be invasive to all parties, time consuming, and far from in my favor, though because the child and members of his family are advocating that he stay with me, it is not an impossibility. This simply does not seem practical given it may precipitate backlash.

All this said, I am going to not take any action at this time. The kid is far too emotionally fragile that I simply cannot risk a bunch of BS happening that causes him more instability and uncertainty. Having his family that is in the picture back me has been huge because they are keeping his mom in check, but it absolutely destroys me to see him cry and ask for normalcy and ask when will he stop stressing and not have that answer for him. I feel helpless, so I can only imagine the level of helpless he's feeling. I am being strong for him. I wish I could make his hurting stop. I remind him when he is uncertain or feeling stressed that I am here to shield him from the noise, he and I will get through this, I am here for him, and that, however unfair it is, he needs to be as strong as he can for me.

divorce_throwaway111,2021-02-03 05:21:01+00:00,Tried to serve my spouse with divorce papers but the jail won't allow it due to a no contact order imposed by the court as part of the sentence,"The location for this is Texas/United States Federal. I had originally tried just after she was arrested but when I went to serve her she had been moved from a state to a federal facility and I didn't know that. Then I was more focused on gaining custody of our child and her trials. Now that I have custody and the trials have happened. I'm trying again.

The timeline is: My spouse was arrested in 2019. She went through 2 trials. One federal and one was state level. The totality of her sentences means that her release date is in 2039. At one of her trials the court ordered she was not allowed to contact me or our child. Like I said I don't have a lawyer of my own and while I don't object to the no contact order the judge and the prosecutor did it without asking me, I found this out when she was sentenced. She was pregnant at the time of arrest and the state terminated her rights involuntarily and I passed all the inspections and checks so I was given custody. Again I wasn't the one who asked to terminate her rights though I don't object or disagree. When I attempted to serve her the jail won't accept. The jail says letting me contact her will cause her to be breaking the no contact order imposed by the court. If she is under their custody they can't make her commit a crime because if I contact she has no choice in it. Her letters and calls are monitored, I know this but I just want to serve her with the papers.

After the jail said no I tried to serve the public defender who worked her state level trial but the public defender said they don't get involved in family matters. So how can I get her served as I'm starting to her frustrated. The jail says even a lawyer doing it for me counts as indirect contact.

homenotmyownanymore1,2021-02-02 03:05:19+00:00,Ex Wife has joined 3 online guilds in Final Fantasy while she has a RO against me. Do online interactions in a video game count as a restraining order violation if I do not respond?,"I got divorced a year ago. During the divorce proceedings my wife got a restraining order against me. Was based off of lies and wont go into specifics other than my lawyer says it has no chance of being renewed past the 2 year cut off. 

In the meantime my ex wife is trying to force me to violate the order by joining the same guilds I join in Final Fantasy. 

The first month after the order went into effect, I left the free company, or guild, on advice of my lawyer as we both used voice chat quite heavily. 

I joined a new group and she followed very soon after. I was talking to random people in discord and she joined saying I better leave or I will violate the restraining order. 

Since I had been there for a week, I just left. I change my character name and left the data center so our characters could never interact. 

I form my own group with some friends who came with me and we grow to be kinda big, talking 250ish members with 20-30 online in discord at a time. Im in discord one day and she joins me and my two RL freinds chat. ""Oh guess you need a new guild."" First thing she says. My friend says some things which I will not repeat here and says its his discord and bans her. I boot her from the guild and close recruitment so she cant get back in. 

I call my lawyer and... well he doesn't really understand any of that and suggested I just stop playing Final Fantasy. Thats not gonna happen. 

I asked him about the harassment from her  and he said this would be very hard to prove unless we had it recorded. Which we do not have any recordings of these interactions. All we have is a character name in Final Fantasy and the word of my best friend since 5th grade. 

My lawyer says I just need to stop playing Final Fantasy and to not try and trap her into getting on voice as that will be proof of me violating the order. He doesn't fully understand what discord is but says that if I knowingly converse with her through it I definitely violate the order. 

All of my friends are on the look out for her as she has followed me to 3 FCs in ffxiv now and the 3rd is one I am the leader of. I don't plan to quit but I want to make sure I am covered. We also implemented a minimum level rule to be in the FC. So she cant just make a new character and join right away. She would have to level up to at least 75 first. 

First question. If she follows my character around and stays just shy of violating SE TOS, meaning I cant just call a GM on her, would that violate the restraining order?

Second. If she rejoins on another account in discord and I unknowningly talk to others while she is in there, does this violate the order? My lawyer had no clue what discord is and answered this question with ""Just make sure not to call her on the phone.""

The 2 year mark for the RO is in September. My lawyer has said if it gets extended, he wold be flabbergasted as it would be highly irregular.

I did and started suspecting something was wrong as there were fishy discrepancies with invoices. I investigated a little on the side, which I now regret doing. It's very clear someone at our company is committing fraud, I suspect on a large scale.  I was in possession of the documents for two days before my manager asked me to give him back everything and wipe some files from my computer ""for safety reasons"", which I did. He said my help wasn't required on this anymore. He didn't say why. The day before yesterday I tried to log in on my work mailbox from home on my phone but couldn't access it. Yesterday as soon as I got in my boss called me into his office and I was told they are firing me for not being productive enough. No other word. I was escorted out, they kept my work laptop, I can't access my mailbox anymore.

Now I need help because I'm freaking out. I uncovered fraud by accident, and I'm certain it's the reason I'm being fired. First thing, I think it needs to be reported (to the IRS or another agency), but I don't know how to do and I don't have much evidence anymore as I didn't download anything. And if I do this I'm scared I may be considered an accomplice because at first I hadn't noticed that some things they were doing were illegal and there's proof I authorized some payments.  I did what I was told and didn't suspect anything but I don't know how that could look like for an investigator. There's also the question of confidentiality if I talk to someone about company matters. The files that I accessed during my ""investigation"" weren't protected but I wasn't among the people supposed to see them either. Could I be prosecuted or sued for this?

Then there's the matter of me being fired, it's putting me in a very difficult situation. I think it's retaliation but I don't know what to do with this. Can I file for unemployment?

I only found out because my husband had posted photos of us to a blackhat forum saying how he'd managed to get into the US through a green-card marriage and detailing a how-to, along with some Adobe keygen DMG files. (Also, he posted photos of himself on the john wearing my bikinis, and a post saying he'd post them to /r/gonewild on here).

Sebas-JHIN,2020-09-13 21:37:36+00:00,My school lost an item irreplaceable to me while moving my belongings from my dorm over the summer without my consent. (Florida),"After spring break, my school decided that classes would shift from in-person to online, and that students were to move out. Initially, my school informed us that we had until April 19th to retrieve our belongings from our dorms. I arranged plans to retrieve my belongings before this date, but on April 1st there was a state-order to stay in place, and students (myself included) were told that we would not be able to retrieve our belongings until at least May 1st. On April 17th, my school sent an email to students informing us that our belongings were being moved. This was troubling to me, because I knew that I had things in my dorm that were irreplaceable to me, especially a pillow that was made by my dad who died when I was 15. I emailed them the same day expressing that I would not like my belongings touched at all. They plainly ignored this, saying they need to move belongings, and informing me that I would be contacted later on as to where I could retrieve my items. 

Fast forward to 3 weeks ago, I’ve moved back into a new dorm, after having retrieved what I thought was all my belongings on May 4th, and I realize that my pillow made by my dad is missing. I email my school’s housing department, explaining my previous room and the details of my missing pillow. I did not receive a reply until 2 days ago, Friday, and only after pestering them several times that I had not even been acknowledged. I was informed that the housing department has not found my pillow in their storage areas or any other boxes labeled for my room, and that they will exhaust all search possibilities in another attempt tomorrow, Monday. 

Needless to say I am enraged at the carelessness they’ve shown with misplacing my belonging, but what’s more I suspect that my pillow has been thrown away, as most mattress pads (including my own) were not returned and were thrown away. I would like to know if I have any options for finding compensation from my school if my priceless item was lost, and especially if it was disposed of without consultation or even notification.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/is7cmd/my_school_lost_an_item_irreplaceable_to_me_while/,legaladvice,2296,157,0.0

She always insulted me, and told me my mom was a who*e.

The thing is she contacted me though social media a couple of days ago and told me she had evidence to free my father from me by making the authorities take me away because my father isn't really mine. 
I took the bait and asked her what she meant and she said that she made a DNA test kit with me  a couple of years ago and when the results came back I didn't match with her so that means that I am not my father's son.

Two and a half years ago, my ex-girlfriend and I broke up. She told me that her and the kids would move to her mom's in nearby San Diego, but instead, she took my daughter to Texas to live with her new ex-con boyfriend, completely lying to me. I have an open case for custody ongoing right now. We've had had a couple of hearings since with the only orders being that I get 3 phone calls a week with my daughter, preferably by video, but due to some tech issues, these are done mostly as a regular phone call that I do record to use for reference in keeping a journal of our conversations. Tonight, I called at our normal time window and chatted with my daughter about her weekend and asked how her brother was doing and she said fine. I then asked if he is doing anything to annoy her, and she told me that he was playing with his penis in front of her again. Now I already plan to file a complaint with Child Protective Services in Texas using an online submission, but what I need to know now is if there is anything I should file here in Riverside County, California that can help get my daughter out of this situation and quickly?

Update: I have filed a report with Texas CPS and they will be investigating. Now the question is what happens next. Do I file for emergency custody here in California, where our custody case is, and do I file right now or wait till CPS gets back to me?

Update 2. Wow. This is blowing up and I am truly overwhelmed and appreciative of all the advice and support I've gotten. It's nearly 4:00 in the morning here and I have not been able to sleep. It looks like it's going to be a very busy day for me. I called CPS last night and filed the report with them. I'm a little apprehensive about calling the cops as well. The reasons for my reluctance is that I don't want to further traumatize my daughter by having her see either her mother or autistic brother arrested. I am hoping CPS will take her away before seeing anything like that. I will be filing an ex parte before noon today to get emergency custody, hopefully I can get the wording right for the judge to grant me that. I do not have a lawyer to do this for me, as I just can't afford it. I'm an unpaid caregiver to my disabled mother who just gets room and board for my work with her. Though I am working through my doctor to get my veteran benefits going, so I can have some kind of income, as it is impossible for me to work given my mothers needs and medical issues.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/huy67q/my_daughterage_9_just_informed_me_that_her_older/,legaladvice,4432,229,0.0

My real mom actually passed away a few years ago, so I had been living with my stepdad through college. We even spread my moms ashes around a tree in our backyard, and I have always seen my stepfather as my actual dad and father figure since my dad was never around. My mom and him were never married, but they were together since I was 4 years old (I am 22 now).  A couple of weeks ago, my stepdad also passed away and I found out that he has left everything in his will to me.

&amp;#x200B;

My stepdad also has a daughter who I never really knew too well - she lived with her mom and moved to a different state than us when I was about 9. My stepdad always claimed that his ex-wife was toxic and always fed her daughter information that made her hate my mom and stepdad - and around 4 years ago, she stopped talking to my stepdad completely.

&amp;#x200B;

Now that he has passed away, she is suddenly back in my life and extremely upset that her name wasnt on the will. Her mom and her said that they are going to be contesting his will. I am worried that they may actually be successful because I was never adopted by my stepdad and my mom and my stepdad never married.

&amp;#x200B;

I could care less about having his stuff, but our childhood home means so much to me because its where my moms ashes were spread. I am scared that I am going to lose the last extension of my parents if I lose the home, and I am unsure what to do. I intend on getting a lawyer if they actually go through with contesting the will - but for now I wanted to check this subreddit to see if I had any ground to stand on.

KittyHateMachine,2020-07-19 07:11:46+00:00,My neighbor is convinced I control owls (AZ),"I live in a rural area that has coyotes, wildcats, owls, hawks, snakes, and even bears. 


My new neighbor has five very small dogs. She likes to let them roam on their own in her yard. When she first moved in she heavily insinuated that the family of barn owls that live in the tree in my yard were my personal property. She also insinuated that I have some sort of power over them. 


Two weeks after she moved in, was the owl incident. A juvenile barn owl smashed himself into my house, dazed and concussed he ended up in the neighbor's yard. I warned her about the owl, told her that he looked like he was starving, and to keep her dogs inside. Typically barn owls do not eat anything bigger than a rat. But she let her tiny dog's charge it and bite at it. Animal control couldn't come out, so I found a wildlife rehabilitation facility and caught the owl with the help of my husband. The poor thing was malnourished and had been wounded for a while, he had a damaged wing.


Tonight she asked us to come outside at 9pm to talk to her about the hawks in the neighborhood. Even after being told multiple times that the birds in our tree are barn owls, she kept calling them hawks. Asking if we could put a fake owl in our tree to scare them off. My husband and I have indoor cats, and we feed song birds to entertain said cats. She asked why we were feeding the hawks. I reiterated to her again, that they were barn owls who do not eat anything bigger than small rats.


I have seen a few hawks around our neighborhood, but again it is a very rural area. Her yard is filthy and overgrown. My husband and I think that's what is attracting mice and rats, and then attracting raptors who want to eat said rodents. 


I suspect that she is trying to establish precedent in case one of the many, many wild animals in our neighborhood eats one of her tiny dogs. On Monday I'm calling animal control, Fish and Wildlife, and our HOA to see what we can do to protect ourselves. We are also going to take a break from feeding the song birds in case they are attracting hawks. I plan on taking pictures of her overgrown and filthy yard.

I live in a small town in Wisconsin so the cops kind of know everybody. But there’s this one cop who keeps pulling me over for the most craziest and asinine reasons like I was too close to the curb or I stopped too close to the stop sign. He’s a young attractive cop and I’m young and attractive as well so I’m thinking he’s trying to flirt with me or something? But the situations are so aggravating and the things he says and does seem like he’s intentionally trying to antagonize me so that I’ll say or do something out of anger and he’ll have an excuse to escalate the situation.

But today he crossed the line. He pulled me over again under the guise that I wasn’t going the speed limit (it was 45 I was going 50) and when he came to my car and said his usual bullshit in the most condescending way he said he had to search ME, not the car, because my car smelled funny. My car smells like vanilla and I’ve never smoked anything in there so I know he was bullshitting me again. I told him that if he wants to search me he’ll have to get a female officer to do it, but he said if I don’t comply he’ll arrest me. So I got out of the car, he told me to put my hands on my car so I did, and he just starts rubbing me up and down. Not even searching for anything, just rubbing me! He went over my thighs twice, my lower back, and almost cupped my boobs. I was wearing a skin type skirt set, no pockets and you could clearly see that I had nothing on me.

I’m typing this like 30 min after it happened, I’m upset and angry and I feel violated. Is there any way I can get him in trouble for this?

masuka1219,2020-06-13 14:18:19+00:00,"Invested in a house with ex and his parents that the ex and I lived in. He cheated (again), I left. They sold the house, gave me nothing and used the profits to buy him a different house.","When my ex and I moved in together for the first time (after dating over 6 years), our credit was not good. His parents got a loan in their name to purchase a home, we put in all the money. Nothing was put into writing prior to the deal. Ex put in $17,000 and I put in $7,000 towards the down payment and other expenses (inspections, earnest money, etc). I paid the mortgage every month we lived there (@$13,000). I painted, purchased light fixtures and assisted in every step of the process when fixing up the house. Bought the house at $140,000. When the house sold, we owed $122,000 and they sold the house for $160,000. 

I got an email from the ex’s mom prior to sale price going public saying they took a loss and NO ONE was getting anything back. They claimed they had put in $12,000 (which is false) and they were losing all of their money, the ex was losing all his money and so was I. Made me giggle, at the end of that email, she forgot to delete a sentence from her draft saying “you will get a $1,000 and nothing more”. I got zero as they clearly changed their minds. Turns out, I was the only one who lost all my money because they took all profits from the sale of our home and used it as a down payment for a new house for him. Mommy and daddy co-signed and bailed out their abusive cheating alcoholic son yet again.... from day 1, the ex has lied, said he got nothing and is renting his current house. All lies.

I have emails where she admits they were not supposed to put in any money, that the house was theirs in name only. She made up “charges” that I owe them like disposal of a piano I left at the house - the ex just admitted to keeping it as a “project”. I have receipts and cancelled checks, the mortgage company understood the arrangement as did the initial realtor. Taking into account there was no contract between us, do I have any legal recourse? In addition to the email where she (generally) admits the arrangement, I believe there is a good chance I could get the real estate agent to attest to my version of the events. 

Side notes - not sure any of this matters but, some additional detail... my new job had paid a total of $50,000 for me to move and that included paying the portion of my previous mortgage that was upside down. The reason I left was he was an alcoholic and the relationship got progressively abusive. he was a serial cheater and I moved out specifically when I found out he slept with his coworker while we were living together (again, this was ongoing) in the parking lot outside the building they worked in. Despite everything, I was trying to be fair and only asked for $4,000 from the sale which was 1/3 of what I believed the profits to be AFTER the ex and his parents got their money back first - i wasn’t even including my initial $7,000 investment. They sold the house because the ex could not afford the $1,100/month mortgage. After I moved out, mommy and daddy paid the mortgage for him because he couldn’t. 

I think you can gather from my post - I’m bitter. I’m pissed that he cheats, takes the money and now owns a home when I had to take a loan off my retirement to be able to get a security deposit so I could rent a place for my kids and i.

What are the laws surrounding easements I need to worry about (if any) and what are my rights regarding trees bordering our properties?","I purchased a home in Fort Thomas, KY (located in Campbell County) last year and this summer we plan to install a privacy fence surrounding our property (I checked and privacy fences are permitted by our local laws). The previous owners had a fence, but the rear portion did not extend across the very back of the property and instead stopped some 20-30 feet away.

We had a property survey done to determine where the back property line was (since the old fence didn't run along it) and learned that our property extends back farther than we originally thought. The neighbors behind us, who have lived in their home for about six years, were surprised as well, and are now raising concerns about our plans to install the new fence.

There are two specific concerns that the neighbor has raised.

* Our property line sits four feet from their concrete driveway. When discussing the matter with our neighbor he brought up something which he termed ""easement to an existing structure"" (a term I'd never heard) and claimed that since his driveway is a structure which existed prior to my plan to install this fence, there are laws/ordinances pertaining to the distance any structure I build must be from his existing structure. I couldn't find much online about this term, but it's possible I don't have the right legal vocabulary to search properly. When it comes to property lines, is there an easement I need to be concerned about and, if so, what? I checked my Warranty Deed and it states ""The subject property is subject to easements, covenants, conditions, and restrictions of record and/or in existence."" How do I determine what these might be?


* Along the whole back portion of my property, including along the property line, is much foliage. In particular along the property line, there is a lot of overgrown honeysuckle and other smallish trees that kind of form a green privacy barrier of sorts between us. In order to install the new fence, much of this foliage needs to be cleared. My question is about what I am allowed to clear. I've heard that if a tree is on my neighbor's side but branches of it extend over to my side, I am allowed to trim those branches back. Is that true? And what about trees that sit directly on the property line? Who is allowed to do what with them? I really don't want to remove something I'm not legally allowed to and have my neighbor get more upset.


When Monday rolls around I plan to engage the local government in some way to learn more, but in the meantime I thought I'd get a head start and see if anyone here knows anything or has had similar experiences.

love_rated,2020-06-11 15:55:24+00:00,My sister is living with a sex offender and refuses to believe he will touch her 5 year old daughter. HELP,"My sister has been brainwashed by a guy convicted of sexual misconduct with minors. They were all under the age of 15, one was 9 , he was 25. 
He told my sister  they were all lying. She believes it. 
  

My sister has a 5 year old daughter whom we believe he has already been inappropriate with due to comments and actions she has made. 

My niece's father and his wife are trying every legal option they can to keep my niece from harm as they are domiciliary guardians, but the new judge is still allowing my sister overnight visits every other weekend and a one week visit for a trip out of state. 

We have inside information from someone who used to be my sister's friend but started reporting what she saw and heard while with my sister, to my niece's father and wife. Reports such as:

-the sex offender is living with my sister (which was not allowed by the previous judge, he told her that she may not have her daughter around any male she is dating) they are lying to everyone saying he doesn't live there but over the course of two months they have pictures of his vehicle parked outside at 10pm and 6am nearly every day. 

-my sister plans on taking my niece to Texas (we are in Louisiana) and not coming back. She said that multiple times and has been actively seeking employment in the area where she plans on going. 

-my sister has allowed the sex offender to give my niece baths 

-they all sleep in the same bed

---------------

We are poor. 
The lawyer wants a 5k retainer to open a new case and my niece's father just spent his savings with the custody battle. 

What can they do to protect my niece? The judge told them that as long as the sex offender is not there when my sister has her visitations, then there is no problem. My sister WILL HAVE HIM THERE. She is a liar with no morals and lives a disgusting lifestyle. 

I let my sister live with me for 4 years because I wanted to give her time to get on her feet and be able to take care of her daughter alone. In 4 years she never kept more than a part time job. She didn't pay bills and only contributed to the groceries with part of her food stamps. She lived like a slob and destroyed the FREE room we gave her. She didn't help with any chores. She ignored my niece and yelled at her when she was upset. Due to my own health and stress I made her move out and live with our mother ( next door to us). I still took care of my niece every day until her father stepped in and took my sister to court for full custody. 

It kills me to talk about my own sister this way but it is the truth. The evidence is there, she is a selfish person who mistreats her daughter and constantly puts her in harm's way. 

Evey time my niece's father finds new evidence that my sister isn't following the rules he reports it but nothing is being done. 

What can they do to save my niece from being assaulted by this man?

bulletchained,2020-06-11 03:06:44+00:00,"A dangerous tree our landlord had 2 years to fix fell and totaled our car, and now he's threatening to evict us","A very bad storm just rolled through and one of my family's biggest fears came to fruition, there was a large rotting dead tree near the edge of the property that we expressed concern for him to remove since around 2 years ago and it fell on our car completely crushing it. it also badly damaged the windshield of our second car.

We consulted two tree removal companies for quotes OVER A YEAR AGO who both said the tree was dangerous and needed to be removed, we have the quotes saved. He still refused to do anything about it, and we have an email from the previous property manager acknowledging he knew about the tree from over a year ago. 

We called him as soon as it happened and he was hysterical on the phone, saying it was our fault for not having comprehensive insurance on the car (only had liability), that he told us ""not to fucking park near that tree"" (we didn't, we parked right beside our house and it fell in a way we hadn't anticipated it would fall, the wind pushed it away from where it looked like it would fall, it was the top of the tree that hit the car), and that hes ""fucking fed up"" and is going to sell all his properties, implying he plans on evicting us.

Im posting this on behalf of my parents so I dont have all the details yet, they are very distraught and this car was very special to my mom even though it was just an 02 lexus, its irreplaceable for her. 

are we in the wrong for not having comprehensive insurance on the car? is there anything we can do? 

we have always been a poor family, we didnt have money for comprehensive on that car, my parents run a business which is why we have 2 cars, the car we have left barely runs as it is 

I took pictures of the damage from all angles, is there anything else I or my parents should be doing, and where can we go from here?

we have renters insurance but I dont think it covers this. my mom has been a broker for 10 years so I figure she knows what she's talking about 

thanks so much in advance, its a really hard time right now

EDIT: we live in Ontario Canada, forgot to add that

EDIT 2: he also said things on the phone like ""you pay low rent i can't afford to be doing all this"" (trust me we dont) which I find funny because we don't even have proper plumbing or electrical in this house either, cant even turn the sink on when someone's in the shower, you get electric shocks from anything plugged in the garage, hes fixed none of this either

edit 3: I guess i should make the intent more clear, we want him to compensate us for the damage and also not fucking evict us but I think the former is more pressing since I dont see how the latter would be legally possible. if he's genuinely planning on selling all his properties should we be organizing with the other tenants?

edit 4: thanks so so much for all the responses so far. except for the ones trying to blame us for parking in our own driveway 100ft adjacent to the big ass tree we had no control over those ones can fuck off

Grexify,2020-06-10 19:22:41+00:00,My insurance company denied my medicine and it put me in the hospital. Should my family sue the insurance company?,"TLDR: My insurance company denied my medication due to an error in their system and it put me in the hospital in a lot of pain. Do I have grounds to sue them?

I was diagnosed with Crohn's disease at 16 and have had many hospital visits since. In August of 2019 my intestines had a scar tissue build up requiring me to get emergency surgery to remove part of my small intestine and part of my colon.

I had been receiving Remicade infusions for my condition before this event but after a while my insurance company deemed it medically unnecessary.
After the surgery they approved me again for an infusion while in the hospital. At this point I was in remission and the doctor said that with continued infusions I would be able to stay in remission. Then when it came time for my next infusion the insurance company denied it once again. (Also this medication cost around $43000 without insurance).

My doctor's office and my parents both tried many times over a 6 month span to get me my medicine. Everytime though the insurance company denied their requests.

Then in March of 2020 I came out of remission and had a flare up due to the lack of medicine. (Each of these flare ups is extremely putting me into screaming pain for hours on end). My parents now furious at this point with the fact that I'm back in the hospital once again are contacting the insurance company and finally get someone at the company to look into the my file. (Only because I was in the hospital once again). Come to find out the insurance company had made a mistake when denying the medication when I was supposed to be  approved.

This mistake left me without medication for that 6 month period and landed me in the hospital in a tremendous amount of pain.

Does my family have grounds to sue the insurance company?

Edit: I'm in Houston, TX

Edit: Thanks for all the great info about Jansen carepath luckily I recently got into their program and I am getting my medicine soon!

So this girl reached out to rent our Airbnb for the weekend. It is my parents and sisters full time home and they come stay with me when they have guests. My parents aren’t really in a good place financially and it’s a good way for them to make extra money. The house rules state no parties or events. The security deposit is $5,000 and it states we can charge up to $50 per extra guest.

Anyway, the girls said she and four other couples would be staying to have a goodbye barbecue for a friend that was deploying. My mom isn’t really tech savvy and took her word for it without looking into anything further. 

About 4 pm this Saturday, we get a call from a neighbor saying that there are at least 40+ vehicles parked in our yard. My mom calls the guest and asks her to make everyone leave. She apologized and said word got out on social media and it got out of hand. Mom gets the sheriff to go up to the property and disband the party. So everyone leaves and the guest swears it won’t happen again. 

Well, no much longer after my mom left, the people who left returned plus even more. By the time the sheriff got back out there at 11 pm, there were over 300 people partying in our home. Property is destroyed and the house is a wreck. The guest who booked it swears her innocence, but then we found an eventbrite posting with our home address on it and they were charging people a fee to come party on our property. 

My mom is very distraught. To top it all off, some people that attended the party left their grill. My mom said they could come get it for the past two days and they said no that wouldn’t work. They got my mom’s number from the guest and have been texting her non stop over it. 

Are there any legal ramifications here? Or is it their right to completely violate my mom’s home and peace of mind like this? 

Also, the people who hosted it the event is called *** gang entertainment and they are seen pictured with guns, other weapons, and money on their social media pages. My mom is terrified that they will try to retaliate if she tries to hold them accountable and now they all know where she lives. She is so emotionally distraught. I feel so bad for her. We don’t know what to do.

gilliganssyrup,2020-06-08 13:26:55+00:00,UPDATE: My dad's house is serviced by a community well that is now owned by an HOA..,"Hi all I wanted to update on the outcome of this.  Sorry, it's honestly a pretty boring outcome - no cool courtroom outbursts at all sadly.  It turns out there were just some liars and there was never actually a legal problem in the first place, my dad was just the victim of the HOA trying to scam him.

[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/gijkoz/iowa_my_dads_house_is_serviced_by_a_community/) is my original thread. The summary is that my dad lives in a house served by a community well that is next to an HOA (but my dad is not part of it).  The HOA told my dad that they now own the well and that he needs to join the HOA and effectively pay them $800/mo to use the well service plus the actual water bill on top of it.

He did end up getting a lawyer to see him ASAP. The lawyer told him the first thing he needed to do was get records of ownership for the well and try to get his hands on the details of the sale. However after a couple days he said he was having issues getting up to date records and was waiting to hear back from a contact at the county because he wasn't sure if COVID had delayed records filing or what.

Then my dad got a surprise: a water bill from the original well servicer, right on time for their 3-times-a-year billing. Obviously that's odd considering he's been told that they don't own the well anymore, and he called them up.

It turns out he was just lied to. The well servicer was never looking to get out of the well business permanently, but rather was looking to contract out the day-to-day testing services of the well to another company because many of the wells they service now require more testing than they did years ago and they no longer have the manpower to do all of it themselves.  But they were not selling the well, simply hiring an independent contractor to drive around and do well stuff all day.

During that time the HOA had asked them to attend an HOA meeting so residents could ask questions about things like filtration, and they mentioned it at that meeting to let residents know that they would be seeing a new person going around doing testing and wanted to let them know because the testing involves taking samples from individual properties and they didn't want anyone to be freaked out.

So when the HOA told my dad they now owned the well, they were just plain lying. When the HOA said they had a new company doing the servicing, they were half truthful: a new company was doing the testing, but the HOA had nothing to do with it, the contract is between the original well servicer and the individual guy they're contracting out to.

The original well servicer also told my dad that the HOA had reached out and informed them around the same time they were contacting my dad, that they were taking over handling billing, and that the well servicer should bill the HOA for all properties and the HOA would then include it in the HOA dues billing to ""streamline"" things for residents claiming it would make their residents' lives easier if they only had to keep track of one bill and not multiple. However the HOA actually has no authority to just declare this and the well servicer just outright told them no, they will continue to bill individual properties.  The timing of this coincides with when they started contacting my dad, so they were just trying to pull a fast one on everyone.

The well servicer is confident that the HOA has 0 legal authority over the well situation and says they respected the HOA in an organizational capacity, like calling meetings so residents could ask questions, and were professionally annoyed with them trying to insert themselves into billing, but they were not aware that the HOA was claiming to own the well. They told my dad that he should not give the HOA any money for water servicing or accept water servicing related information from them in any way.

So going back around to the lawyer, my dad got an appointment with the lawyer to tell him all this and the lawyer had his own news that matched up entirely: The reason he wasn't finding up to date records following the supposed sale was because he doesn't believe a legitimate sale has happened, he thinks my dad was just getting scammed.

So all in all my dad will continue to use the well as he always has.  He is pretty angry that he had to spend a bunch of money to find out what he already knew, that the HOA is made of dicks, but we are definitely breathing a sigh of relief.

Meanwhile as for the HOA my father's lawyer has suggested that there may be room for legal action against the HOA reps for what was basically fraudulent claims. My father doesn't want to spend the money persuing it at this time, but the well servicer did ask for copies of everything he received from the HOA because they want to review it with their own lawyer.

Thanks to everyone who gave advice - we're grateful for it and also for the fact that we didn't have to use most of it, ha ha!",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/gyzaz9/update_my_dads_house_is_serviced_by_a_community/,legaladvice,11572,2,1.0

I am 23 and was in college for most of the year, but graduated in August of 2019. I’ve been living with my partner since then and even stayed with him during breaks while I was in school.

Any and all help is greatly appreciated.

**Edit:** Wow, this post has blown up more than I ever expected. Thank you to everyone for your advice regarding my current predicament. I’ve tried responding to everyone, but it’s too much at this point so I will fill you all in with the information I have told others that has been buried in the comments. 

To answer several of your questions, yes I am on my parents’ health insurance. That’s the only financial help they’ve given me. I understand that’s a lot in and of itself. But I have paid for my own rent, utilities, car, phone, gas, food, education, and any other expenses in my name, (i.e. copayments or other medical bills the insurance doesn’t cover). 

Despite all this, I won’t be amending my or my parents’ tax returns. They have done more than enough for me in the past, therefore the least I can do for them is give them a pass on this and prevent any repercussions they might face from the IRS. Instead, I will file as an independent in my 2020 tax returns either by doing it myself or by having a different CPA my parents don’t use to help me do it. All I can do from there is hope I get the stimulus check by then. $1,200 just isn’t worth it to me to fight so much to get, and to potentially burn bridges with my parents. It might be worth it to others in this situation, just not me. I greatly appreciate everyone’s feedback and I hope you all were able to help others reading this post that are stuck in a similar situation.

pleasehelp45283,2020-04-14 17:43:10+00:00,"(MA) after giving me written permission to make a permanent decision, my ex changed her mind and has now decided to sue me for emotional damages. Advice needed--thinking of settling.","I will probably consult with a lawyer in the near future. I understand that the title is vague but I was trying to keep triggering topics out of the title. I'm using mobile so there may be some formatting issues. 

I have a daughter (13) with an ex who was not in her life. We were young, in our early 20s, when she was born. My ex wasn't ready to give up her life and be a mom yet so I assumed full custody. She had another child when our daughter was 9 and never spoke to our daughter again or really acknowledged her. I remarried as well and my wife has been an amazing stepmom to my daughter. 

My daughter was diagnosed with cancer in 2016. I made sure to let my ex know of course and sent periodic updates. She didn't visit or call and basically things went on as normal. 

In December 2019 it became apparent that her fight was drawing to a close and there was nothing anyone could do. I sent the following email (copy pasted text because I'm technologically illiterate, with private info removed): 

""Jess, 
I want to let you know that we got the results of E's scan today. The cancer has spread significantly with several new growths and no change to the old sites. 

At this time doctors are advising that treatment is unlikely to be successful and we would be better off providing her with comfort care instead. She will be a lot more comfortable and be allowed to go home which she really wants. 

L, the doctors, and I have all talked to her as well as child life. She has agreed that it's time to come home. She is being discharged tomorrow to hospice at home. 

As always, she would love to see/hear from you.""


she replied to that email a short time later with ""thank you for the update"". She didn't call or reach out to our daughter at all. 

After coming home from the hospital, my daughter asked me to mail a letter and to send an email she'd written to her mother. I don't know what the letter or email said but I know that neither one was replied to. 

In January, our daughter passed away. I sent the following emails:

""Jess, 
I wish I didn't have to write this email. Our sweet E passed away in her sleep. It was very peaceful. I will send another email with funeral details. 

Don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything."" 

and then the one about the funeral. I had to redact most of that one because it was full of personal information but this is the important part:

""Jess, 
In addition, we have decided on cremation. Please let me know if you would like any of her ashes. I can even get them made into jewelry or put in an urn for you and have it shipped if that's easier for you.""

She replied to that one thanking me and telling me she would rather not have the ashes and that I could do what I liked with them. 

We did. We gave some to my mother, had some turned into jewelry for my wife and three younger girls, I kept some and we buried some in a few of her favorite places. At this point the only ashes that physically exist are mine, my mother's, and my wife/daughters'. 

Fast forward to the end of February and I get an email from her stating that she'd had a change of heart and asking if she could have some of our daughter's ashes. 

I told her that unfortunately we didn't have any ""left"", but that my wife offered to send her the necklace she had made. She declined and did seem a little offended that we'd offered but it was all we had to give. 

A few days ago I received notice that she was suing me for emotional damages for ""failing to offer her our shared child's cremains"" and ""offering a used necklace"" and some other nonsense. 

I'm going to be honest: I feel like the only person who is being emotionally damaged here is me. I'm dealing with a huge devastating loss of my first child, my best buddy, my constant companion while also dealing with the stress of the pandemic/lockdown, two young kids who don't understand, AND a brand new baby (born end of March). I feel like I've been nothing but nice and communicative to her and this is what I get for it? 

I'm angry, I'm tired, and I'm frustrated. Realistically, I don't even have the emotional energy to fight it and I'm seriously considering throwing some money at it and hoping it goes away.

cookiescoop,2020-04-14 13:23:18+00:00,"Bank removed $2,000 from my account and has not returned it — it's been a week","I bank with TD. On Wednesday evening, I checked my bank balance on my app, and I saw that I had a negative balance. I'm not well-off by any means, but I have NEVER overdrawn my account or even incurred a maintenance fee for having less than the required balance. I saw that there had been a withdrawal for $2,000, and then a transfer of over $1,000 from my savings account to my checking account. I feared that I'd been hacked, so I immediately changed my passwords and called the bank. 

When I called the bank, they explained what happened, and I have to say that I've never heard anything like it. My father is joint on my account because I had lived abroad, and he had given me money for a visa. I wanted him to be able to access that money, so I put him on my account and just never took him off. I will say (because the bank tried blaming it on him) that my father would NEVER touch my money. He would be mortified if he thought this was at all his fault. 

Apparently, my father cashed a check at TD for $2,000. The teller was new, and instead of removing the money from the person who wrote the check (it was a TD check), she cashed the check against MY account. After calling the bank, they assured me that this was a normal thing to do if the check wasn't a TD check (which it was), because how would they know if the check written was ""good"" or not? Until the check cleared with the other institution, it is completely normal for *any* bank to cash against the account of the person the check is written *to*, not *from.* And, as my father doesn't have his own account at TD, it came out of mine, because he is joint on the account.

Apparently, the teller saw that I didn't have $2,000 in my checking account (because who does?), and instead of overdrawing my account, transferred exactly enough money from my savings to cover the check. Now, my father is *not* on my savings account. He should not have access to that money. Even if cashing against my account was the right move (which, I don't see how that's legal in any situation), she should *never* have touched my savings account. 

Obviously, I can't go into a branch right now due to COVID-19. I have called so many times, I swear they know my voice. It's been 6 days, and the money hasn't been returned to my account. I was told it would be in there within 3 business days (which is also unacceptable), and, three days later, it's still not back. I keep calling and I've already told them I'm taking my business elsewhere because it's absolutely ridiculous that this has happened, and they're being wholly unhelpful. I don't feel like they're treating this with the urgency that they should — they seem to think that, because I have *some* money left in my savings, it's ""not that bad"" and I'm ""lucky it isn't going to take 10 days."" Both things were said to me. Is there anything that I can even threaten them with, legally? This doesn't seem right.

TL;DR — Due to bank error, I have $2,000 missing from my account. It has been 6 days, and it still hasn't been returned, despite the time frame they quoted me coming and going.

theincrediblestapler,2020-04-13 19:36:52+00:00,Ex-wife set up mail forwarding for our child to get his birthday money. Now she is going through my mailbox. IA.,"I am divorced and our time is 50/50 but my ex-wife has primary custody.  My son had a birthday a couple of weeks ago. A few weeks prior to his birthday I received a notice in the mail about mail forwarding having been set up - to be forwarded from my address to an address I had never heard of (but knew was not my ex-wife's address).  I assumed it was some kind of scam and contacted USPS and they canceled it.

Come birthday time we received nothing for him in the mail, which is atypical. I am fortunate to have friends and family who love my child and spoil him to death, so normally we receive several cards, but this year received nothing. However my parents and other family members did confirm that they had sent cards, including cash and checks, which we did not receive.

My parents sent a replacement birthday card and we did not get that either, so I contacted USPS thinking it was being forwarded after all.  They confirmed it wasn't being forwarded, but said that they have record of letters that should have arrived on specific dates, that we haven't seen.  I ended up getting a camera  and found that every day shortly after the mail arrives, my ex-wife was driving up, sorting through it.   I talked to my parents who confirmed the checks they sent were cashed, and after some sleuthing have figured out that the address used for mail forwarding, while not my ex-wife's, is actually her boyfriend's place.

The person I spoke with at the post office said this is murky territory because the mail IS being received by a legal guardian of the person it's intended for, but he understands it's ridiculous. He doesn't think I can do anything but is going to check with the postmaster anyway and they are going to call me back.  In the mean time he recommended a locking mailbox which I will be installing today.  He said I could report it to the police and that might help.

I filed a report of mail theft with the police but they were generally disinterested.

I am wondering if I have any other legal recourse.  This may seem small but it seems ridiculous to me that she has gotten away with gifts from my family to my son by stealing from my mailbox.

throwaway_acc_0154,2020-04-13 13:34:29+00:00,Getting evicted because of snoring problem.,"*I originally posted this somewhere else and some suggested I post it here. Based in NYC*


My boyfriend and I have lived in a co-op for about 1 1/2 years now, no prior issues whatsoever. About 5 months ago 2 older women moved into the apartment below us. One of them is large, with a heart issue - and snores like NOTHING we have ever heard before. My boyfriend is a heavy sleeper and nothing wakes that man up. But her snoring? Is insane.

After 2 weeks of waiting it out to see if she would stop, we spoke to our superintendent. He said he knew exactly who it was as multiple tenants had complained about her snoring disturbing their sleep - but because she is “old” with medical issues, he said there’s nothing we can do and suggested we sleep in our living room.

We have tried ear plugs and sleeping with the radio on. The ear plugs didn’t stop the vibrations and sleeping with loud music on only gave me a headache in the morning. So we decided to go downstairs and try to be as friendly as possible - we spoke to her sister who explained that she has a heart problem. We showed her items from Rite Aid that could help, offered to buy them, and suggested a sleep study.

The next day we receive a call from the board saying we need to stop harassing the neighbors and that if we continued, we’d risk being evicted. We tried to explain the situation and they said they received a call from 2 older women scared for their “safety”. 

So we’ve been sleeping with the radio on to try and drown the noise. Well today we received a call from the super saying the board is going to send an official letter out, but we have 30 days to move. Apparently the radio is a disturbance and so is our “loud talking” at night.

My question is, is this legal..? Is there anything we can do..? We are genuinely confused. There is no way we’re going to find another apartment in 30 days.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/g0j1ec/getting_evicted_because_of_snoring_problem/,legaladvice,7562,52,0.0

She will not take no for an answer. I haven't responded to her text messages since September but it doesn't matter. She won't stop.

I was very firm with her last time she came to my apartment in February. I told her I wasn't interested in seeing or hearing from her ever again.

Or the stay at home directive is lifted. 

She texts like we're having an ongoing conversation, or I've asked her to call me ""daddy"" (I haven't) or I've given her some reason to believe I want to see her again.

Another edit: I may possibly have an article of mail somewhere with my name/address on it, looking for it right now. I definitely have text messages between us with details about living here.

I shopped around for dentists in my area who took my health insurance. I found one and asked multiple times if they took my insurance. They said yes and scanned my card. Everything was a green light. 

I went to my appointment and everything was going smooth until the second tooth. He broke the tooth in half. The roots are still in my jaw. He told me I would have to come back once it healed up and he will get it out. 

 I got a deductible bill in the mail for $800. It showed what my insurance covers and my deductible. Deductible was $80. I sent in my check and that was that.

About a month later I got another bill in the mail saying that the dentist actually does not cover my insurance and I have to pay the full amount. I went there to fight it and it was a different receptionist and she kept saying “I never said that” “ that wasn’t me”.  I actually had to say “I don’t care who it was, me saying “you” means your business told me they accepted my insurance “. 

In the end I walked out because I was getting pissed. I also recorded that conversation. The bill went against my credit which lowered it substantially. Is there anything I can do?

My understanding is she can't be forced to go to the hospital (i.e. through police or ambulance) without proof of her condition and that she can deny her condition if we call 9-1-1.

Tonight, I had to call an ambulance to my apartment. My boyfriend was acting erratic and seemed to be in psychosis. He then had a full-on seizure. 

Later on, I found out he smoked synthetic marijuana. I don’t know much about that. I do not do drugs. I do not even smoke normal marijuana. I called an ambulance because I didn’t know what else to do - I was scared. 

Three policemen showed up first and entered without knocking. Asked where he was. I started to cry and they told me to go in the other room as I was annoying them. I complied. Then, the larger of the three cornered me in the hallway.

He said my pupils were completely “blown” and I better start telling the truth about what drugs I do. I told him that I have incredibly poor eye sight and my pupils have been naturally large since childhood - this is true. He told me, “stop fucking lying to me now or you’re getting arrested for drug possession.” Again, I denied any drug use and told him he could literally drug test me through blood and urine at that exact moment - I am clean. He left me in the hallway and another man came out, rinse and repeat. Then the third did the same thing. They kept telling me to look at lights and laughing and saying I was the biggest liar they had ever met. At this point I’m amped up and scared. I am a 23 year old woman. I am in nursing school. I do not do drugs.

At this point, they have the ems there coming or and checking my pupils and laughing. They were telling my boyfriend that he better rat on both of us or we were both going to jail. They ripped apart my whole entire room and starting laying into me for having cipro prescribed (an antibiotic). The largest policeman then told me he was going to speak to my landlord and have me evicted.  I reiterated that I am completely clean and could pass not only a field sobriety test but a drug test of any kind. He retorted with “I highly doubt that” as he continued to tear apart my home.

Eventually, they got my boyfriend into the ambulance and all three of the cops left laughing. The largest turned around and said, “Congratulation on ruining your life. don’t call an ambulance when you are on drugs, I’ll see you around”.

Not only am I shaken, but I feel threatened and ashamed. The man I was with should not have been on anything, but I called an ambulance because I was scared he might die! I didn’t call them to be harassed. Did they even do anything really wrong that I can report this? We live in a small town in NEPA. I know that they heard a possible drug incident over the scanner and had three of them show up because they thought they’d find a good amount of drugs/an incident of interest.

So I posted back in February about the incompetent bank giving away my account. Not much to report on the legal front, but I did report them to several governing bodies as suggested by helpful posters. The bank did reimburse my entire account and bounced check fees as well as opening a new account number with my money while admitting ""some fault"". So I got my money back and have not moved my account as some posters suggested as it is a beneficiary account my grandfather set up 20 + years ago before he passed that accumulates 5% interest.  So basically, if I remove it I will never get this type of interest again because these types of accounts don't exist anymore.  

My update mostly concerns abut my personal situation, which recently become a problem. My husband and I are trying refinance our house, and on the equifax report... surprise surprise... THE OTHER WOMAN'S CAR LOAN IS UNDER ME.  STILL.  8 months later. Also, her current address.  Which means they did not fix any of this. I had tried to contact the other woman (non-confrontational) about this situation back in March letting her know her info was breached and she immediately blocked me.  No lawyers I had contacted were interested in taking my cases since they gave my money back so I kind of dropped it.  But now I've filed fraud under my credit report, and now have to fix my credit with her under it. 

I'm not sure what my next steps are, but I re-filed some complaints under FDIC and am trying to figure out what else I can do, since clearly this bank isn't interested in actually fixing this situation. Luckily, she pays her car payments on time so I don't have any dings on my credit, but I also have a car on my credit report that isn't mine. So that's fun.

frequentflyer801,2019-11-03 13:11:43+00:00,About to get arrested when I land in Boston,"I can’t believe this is happening to me. I’m flying from Chicago to Boston now and police are waiting for me when I land, so I don’t have much time but am still gonna try and figure out my options. Here’s what happened:

..

I was on an American Airlines flight from Chicago to Boston on November 3rd, 2019. Because of low blood pressure, a foot injury, and to prevent my ankles and feet from swelling, I use a small sling that hangs from the tray table (while closed) and props your feet higher. This sling is often advertised on Facebook for this exact purpose - to make flights more comfortable for us shorter passengers. 

Right before takeoff, the flight attendant, who was in a very grumpy mood, yelled at me to put my feet on the ground. I am a frequent traveler and have never been instructed to put my feet on the ground before. 

“You have to put your feet on the ground!” I cannot emphasize how rudely she barked at me. 

“No I don’t but okay.” As I put my feet down. Although I had never been instructed to put my feet down in the 100+ flights I’ve taken with my foot sling, I complied. I put my feet down immediately. 

Even if it’s technically not allowed by some rule I’m not aware of, the flight attendant unnecessarily escalated the situation. 

She immediately escalated: 
“Would you like to go back to the gate? We’re gonna go back to the gate!” And immediately ran down the cabin to her crew members in the back. 

But right after she said that, the captain announced that we were taking off. 

She came back to my seat and barked: 
“Police will be waiting for you when we land in Boston.”

My seatmates were equally shocked at her escalating behavior. I had put my feet down when she asked, and my 5 words, “no I don’t but okay” are now the cause of a police interrogation. 

Her statement caused me to panic. I’m now mid-flight with no idea what will await me at the gate. 

So I took some time-stamped photos immediately and stowed my foot sling back into my backpack for the remainder of the flight. 

Am I screwed? What should I do once the police interrogate me? Should I hire a lawyer first?",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dr06ws/about_to_get_arrested_when_i_land_in_boston/,legaladvice,18324,17,0.0

It seems the old board wasn’t all that popular, and all the incumbents including the chairman lost their re-election bids by a significant margin.

As the new chairman and armed with the keys to the town hall, I gathered all the relevant documents and handed them over to the DA’s office. They were pretty interested and investigated for a few weeks, but ultimately they told me that even though they thought the whole thing was shady, too much of it hinged on whether the former chairman had criminal intent. They said it came down to a question of whether or not the town just kept really awful records of discussions, voting, and recusal when considering contracts with the chairman. Part of their reluctance I think was that he had already been voted out of office.

Mostly I’m just glad the guy is gone. Unfortunately I’ve been busy since getting elected since the town records weren’t the only thing that got sloppy while the other guy was in charge. Also it turns out that local government positions are pretty thankless, but someone has to do it I guess. And I’m not a crook so that’s a plus.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dq5li8/updatewi_local_official_awards_himself_contracts/,legaladvice,1157,1,0.0

OCmotherplucker,2019-11-01 08:44:30+00:00,HELP- my autistic son’s behavioral therapist called CPS over turmeric. Not kidding.,"I need help and I’m hoping that some of you may have some insight. 
My autistic  6 year old has been with the same ABA (behavioral therapy) company for 4 years and we love them. Several weeks ago, we got a new behavioral therapist who is with my son 4 days a week, 2 of them at our home. I have not been happy with her as she rubbed me the wrong way from the start: harsher that necessary with my son and overall cold and calloused. I spoke to our BCBA (supervisor) and she said the therapist was brand new to the company and that they’d give her further training. 

Today, I get a phone call from our BCBA who tells me that CPS was called over a concern that there was a bottle of supplements (turmeric, to be specific) on the counter that my son allegedly picked up and it concerned her. The therapist never said anything to me about this.  Our BCBA then says that she herself has been to our home many times and is here to back me up in anyway needed and that she has never been concerned about anything in our home. 

Questions: 

1. should I obtain legal council or just move forward and willingly work with CPS knowing that there is no case?  My thought is that this is something frivolous and clearly not neglect, but I honestly have no idea what to expect with this process and want to do what’s best for my family. 

2. If I do decide to move forward sans attorney, do I allow them in when they visit? 

3. How much (or little) information do I give during the home visit? 

Any feedback would be much appreciated. This is brand new territory for me and, quite frankly, I’m terrified even though I know that I’m a damn good special needs mother.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dq1j6n/help_my_autistic_sons_behavioral_therapist_called/,legaladvice,4372,116,0.0

The families of the girls who were wearing the costumes are now threatening to sue me. Are there any grounds for this?,"To break it down in the simplest details, some people I follow (college freshmen) on social media recently dressed up in extremely distasteful and ignorant Halloween costumes and posted the pictures on their social media Instagram and Facebook accounts. I believe one of the girls had her Instagram private, so you had to request to be her friend to see her content, but at least one of the girls had her profile public. I tried to warm them that it was super offensive, but they lashed out at me with bullying comments. I screenshotted the photos of the offensive costumes, and posted them to my twitter, stating how distasteful it was and tagging their university. The tweet has now gone viral due to how offensive the costumes are. In the beginning stages, people replied to the tweet and requested I post the Instagram handles, so I took a screenshot that included the handle of one of the girls and her name. I just found out that although this girl is in college and lives away from her parents, she is apparently still 17. I’m assuming the rest are 18. The families are now threatening to sue me. I deleted my mention of her Instagram handle once I heard that the girls were receiving severe backlash (apparently death threats), but other people got ahold of their information anyways and other people posted screenshots of their facebooks.

SmartHomeThrowaway1,2019-10-30 17:41:02+00:00,"Apartment complex installed ""SmartHome"" devices in my apartment without my consent, is asking me to sign a lease addendum consenting to personal data collection and agreeing to be financially responsible for maintenance and upkeep of said devices. What are my options? [Colorado]","I got a notice via email a while back that the Apartment complex where I live in Denver was going to be installing ""SmartHome"" devices in my apartment. I didn't respond because I assumed I would have to consent in order for them to do anything.  I was wrong, and they replaced my door lock, thermostat, plugs and switches, water sensor, etc. while I was traveling for work. 

Now they want me (and every other tenant) to sign an addendum to our leases saying I requested this and asking that I consent to data collection and that if anything goes wrong with the devices that they put in, I am responsible to pay $250 to fix any damage or maintenance to repair or replace them if I do not notify the building within 5 days of malfunction.

Some of the language in the addendum makes me very uneasy.

 `""You have requested that we provide [Insert Name of SmartDevice Vendor] in your unit. We agree to do so and you agree to pay additional rent in the amount of $0.00 per month""`  

I did not request this.

`""Information collected by [Insert Name of SmartDevice Venor] (""Information""): We have listed information collected by each device we supply, some of which may be considered ""Personal Information,"" depending on your jurisdiction:""""1. Front Door Lock:- Entry activity by time and code used- Technical information from device, including, but not limited to, battery level and lock status""`

This language is pretty much the same for Thermostat, SmartPlugs and Switches, Hub, Water Sensor and software to use it all.

`""Information Sharing: Anonymized and aggregated information collected by the Service may be shared with third parties for energy benchmarking, quality of service determinations, and for research and product development. Recipients of this information may include, but are not limited to, equipment manufacturers, consultants, educational institutions, utilities, study sponsors and government agencies""`

Additionally, there is language that specifies that the devices are owned by the property and if I lose or damage any of them, I am subject to a $250 fine. 

`""If a device has been damaged or appears to be malfunctioning, you are required to notify us within five (5) days.""`

What are my options? I really like my apartment and don't want to leave, but I also don't want to consent to sharing personal information re: entering/exiting my apartment with anyone, even if it is anonymized and aggregated and certainly don't want to be on the hook financially for malfunctioning products that I did not want or consent to being installed.

thro0waway3313,2019-10-30 02:50:31+00:00,There's a video of me in a porn video going around my medical school,"Hello folks, 

I'm in dire need of advice. 

I was called into my associate dean's office where they told me that they had a complaint that I knowingly posting a video on my Instagram showing me and my partner in sexual acts. I thought it was ridiculous and told them that there was no way a video existed of me doing anything sexual and it would never end up on my Instagram. Which, as much as I knew, was the truth. So they dismissed me and told me they'd update me on what was happening if anything progressed. 

Today I received this email:

    ""As promised I am following up with you regarding the video in question. The attached file was anonymously sent to me. Please advise as to whether, now that you’ve seen it, you have any knowledge of the video or it being posted to your Instagram account. 
    -Associate Dean""

Attached to the email was the video and it was exactly what they had described. It looked like an iPhone screen recording of my story with a video I made with an ex 5 years ago that I completely forgot about. I haven't talked to my ex in 2-3 years and it was a pretty brutal breakup so I just didn't think of it but we definitely made this video.

What was really strange, other than it was up for at least an hour (according to the story stamp it said '1h') was that it had these captions on it:

""She sent this as a 'promo'""

""She said she was gonna blur my face but I don't want it up at all""

""Any ideas to prevent her from posting it without getting law enforcement involved?""

So I sent this as my reply:

&amp;#x200B;

    ""This is my first time seeing that video, that was my ex of over 5 years ago who I have not spoken to in a few years. I just tried phoning her with no response and just texted her to see if she has any idea of what's going on. Never thought about an old partner having a video of us. To my knowledge, that video was never on my Instagram, let alone left on my story for over an hour, I'm constantly on Instagram. 
    I just changed my password and hope to update you soon. ""

&amp;#x200B;

Followed soon with

    "" I can't seem to be able to reach her. I'm not sure what the video says about releasing a promo or getting law enforcement involved. We haven't talked at all within the last 2 or 3 years. 
    Any ideas of what I can do? Please advise. ""

&amp;#x200B;

I'm completely stunned. I never thought a video like that would come back to haunt me. 

My primary concern is to make sure that there is no legal ground to kick me out of school or prevent me from finishing my education as I'm in my second year and more than $150,000 in debt. Other concerns include, can I get in trouble for this? And what else can I do to mitigate the situation?

apttest1234,2019-10-29 17:43:33+00:00,Three men entered my apartment as inspectors but then proceeded to announce themselves as “Immigration”.,"I’m currently renting an apartment in a small condominium in Florida, and I’ve been living here for almost 3 years. Over the weekend, my landlord notified the residents of the building (via a note on the door) that management would be entering all units for approximately 15 minutes on Monday, 28th “primarily for insurance purposes”. However, they were not able to actually get to my apartment until today. I was not physically present when they came, but I do have cameras set up, which I was monitoring.  As the men entered the apt, one of them proceeded to announce themselves as “Immigration”. They then went around taking pictures and filming everything within the apt while they also took notes. After about 15-20 minutes of inspecting, they left. I immediately messaged my landlord and asked who these men were and why they declared themselves that way. All he responded is that they were inspectors and not immigration.
 
The way I see it, either my landlord is lying, or one of these men falsely impersonated a federal officer. Either way, I’d like to know what I can do about it and if I have any legal recourse in this matter.

Okay so when I was first hired on at my job (6 years ago) I was given a key that had access to some of the internal offices which hold sensitive information.  I was told that if I ever lost said key I would owe the company $15,000 to have the entire building rekeyed due to security.

I have lost this key.  (It was attached to my car keys which were hooked to the loop of my pocketbook. I was mugged and the key was stolen along with a lot of other personal belongings.) 

So now my boss and my boss’ boss and his boss keep calling me to come in and fill out paperwork to get on a payment plan to repay the “money I owe.”   I have received letters from their official letterhead and I am informed the next step will be termination and lawsuit. And they have also threatened to start docking my pay.  

I have no intention of paying the fine.

The catch is that I was told this was the consequence verbally when I was handed the key.  My supervisor told me “you will need to sign an agreement at some point but we’ll worry about that later.”   I replied with “to be clear, I will not be paying that if I haven’t signed yet.  Do you want to keep possession of the key until then?”  My supervisor laughed as though I was joking and said it was more convenient for me to just hold on to it and he wouldn’t forget to have me sign, he promised.

Well he never brought it up again and I of course did not either.  

My question is.  Can I be legally forced to uphold this on the basis of “verbal contract?” At this point I have not reminded them that I never signed.  I have simply ignored them.  But I worry we will have to get lawyers involved soon and I’m not sure how to proceed.  I will be visiting my lawyer Monday.  So hopefully more answers then. 

$15,000 is about 1/3 of my yearly salary. I can not afford this “charge.”

heymikeyp,2019-10-26 06:22:39+00:00,Roommate has been lying to me for a month. Is very late on rent. And is currently attempting to bail without paying me.,"It's a very long story I'd rather not get into detail. But how should I proceed? Basically she has been lying to me over the last month making numerous excuses. Lies after lies. Moving her stuff little by little out of the apartment with BS reasons for doing so. And shes been doing it sneakily behind my back. I'm not dumb so I finally called her out on it recently.

Fact 1: She hasn't been getting mail here.  
Fact 2: Has been moving her animals out.  
Fact 3: Had attempted to hide moving stuff out.  
Fact 4: We both have living room cameras installed, she had hers well before me. I only installed it recently to know for sure if she was moving stuff out, and she had been doing it under the camera and handing her BF her stuff over the rear porch like I wouldn't notice, instead of using the front door where the camera is pointed. She has also had him sneak around to help her.  


Her excuse is she was moving stuff out of her room into a storage unit so she can have her carpet fixed from the bunny chewing on it. Except this doesn't explain why she moved all her animals out, and stuff out of her bathroom and our kitchen.  


Once November hits, she will have owed around 2500$. Right now it's at 1800$. I was dumb for letting this go on for a longer than it should have. We agreed a while back as long as she made payments before the 15th everything would be fine (rent is due the 1st). I'm a nice guy, very easy going, and she obviously took advantage of that. I know I should go to small claims court and sue, but I'm not positive on how to proceed if she's bailing, and I don't know where she is going.  


I don't think I can afford this on my own, so I may have to break the lease early. Should I sue her for half of the cost of breaking the lease as well? Hopefully someone knows more here. Would really appreciate it thank you.

This past June I had surgery to have my tubes tied and to have my IUD removed at the same time. My OBGYN (also the surgeon who performed my surgery) said that he was going to remove my IUD at my first appointment, at my pre-OP appointment, and at the hospital before my surgery. He verified that he removed my IUD after I woke up after surgery, and at the follow-up appointment the week after. During the follow-up appointment, I complained about a potential hormonal imbalance considering I was getting chin acne and gained weight. He responded with ""well if anything, it's probably the removal of your IUD that's causing those symptoms"".

This is where it gets a bit weird. I had an ultrasound this morning, and my IUD was still in my uterus! So I requested that those images be sent to me for proof. And I went to my OBGYN right after and requested my records. I read through them and saw no notes regarding my IUD, but I requested a letter from my OBGYN/surgeon stating that he removed my IUD and I got it.

L0stAndAnxi0us,2019-10-24 08:46:06+00:00,A 15 year old girl made false allegations to CPS about my 8 yo son because she doesn't like my 15 yo daughter.,"My daughter was close friends with a girl for a few years and they had a falling out over ridiculous things. I don't want to go into too many details because the reasons are very specific and the family would immediately know I was talking about them. 

The girl's mother is crazy and she likes to threaten people with legal action and throw her job title around (she does not work in law or any real position of power... She just has delusions of grandeur). The mother also believes her daughter is perfect and everyone is jealous and bullying her daughter because of their jealousy. 

I will refer to the mother as Lorrie and the daughter as Katy so the rest of this is less confusing. 

Lorrie has been to the school multiple times and accused my daughter and other students of bullying Katy. The assistant principal has pulled my daughter out of class to discuss Katy. I'm not sure if Lorrie had anything to do with the CPS report but I can not contact her directly. Lorrie refused to communicate with me when the girls first stopped being friends. I tried to contact her several times and she does not answer my calls and has been outwardly hostile to my daughter on more than one occasion.

Katy is a bully who says hurtful and dark natured stuff to try and appear ""edgy"" to her friends. My daughter has told me some pretty horrific stuff that Katy said and I advised my daughter to stay cautious throughout their friendship. When the friendship fell apart, Katy began to say pretty cruel things about my daughter, my son, and our home. My daughter would tell me about the worst of it. 

One of the things Katy said about my 8 year old son was disgusting and completely out of line so my husband and I remembered it pretty vividly. My daughter told us about the comment about 3 or 4 months ago. 

A few days ago, CPS knocked on our door while I was at work and told my husband that someone made a report to them about my son and the complaint was exactly what Katy was said at school a few months ago. There is no one else who could have made this complaint. It was very specific and had no affiliation with anything based in reality. My husband said the CPS employee was very nice and they seemed like they knew that the report was ridiculous. I wasn't there so I don't know what the tone of the conversation was like. 

The problem is I have no proof. The assistant principal at my daughter and Katy's high school is planning to interview some of the students that were around Katy when she made these comments about my son so I might have some backup which is great, but it's still just hearsay and there is no tangible evidence like text messages or recordings of her saying these things about my son. 

What should I do? Is there anything I can do? Do I even have a leg to stand on? All I have my word, my daughter's word and the possible words of a few 15 year old kids.

Then I mentioned that if we had a union this wouldn't happen, because my neighbor who works at [redacted name of grocery store] is guaranteed a certain amount of hours due to the contract. 

About an hour later, I got called into the office by one of the managers who said that complaining about working conditions while on the clock is not appropriate and unprofessional when customers might hear.  Fair enough, I apologized and left.  He said he would talk to the store manager and decide if I would get a writeup.  

Three days later, I was doing the closing shift.  I left the store after midnight and as I was walking to my car, the store manager stopped me in the parking lot and told me that discussing unions is against policy and I would be fired.  I told him I just want to go home, can we talk tomorrow.  He grabbed my arm, said ""I have a gun and I know how to use it"" and then berated me for talking about unions and said that if I did it again I would be sorry and my family would miss me and a bunch of other stuff that I forgot.  Then he went back into the store and I left. 

I want to quit but I really need this job so that is not an option. I have tried to contact the market manager as well as the ethics hotline.  Neither one has gone anywhere.  Market manager didn't respond after the initial ""thank you for your message"", and when I attempted to follow up a month later, he told me to stop bothering him about it. The ethics hotline said they would investigate but I never heard anything back.  

I would like to know if I have any legal recourse.  Of course I will quit as soon as I find another job, but that might be a while because there aren't too many options here.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dm9cbi/talked_about_unionizing_and_manager_threatened_me/,legaladvice,1553,76,0.0

Called the labor board today. Turns out it was all legal. The gratuity was an included and required charge. In Maryland they’re allowed to take as much of it as they want in this case, as long as I still make minimum wage, hourly + tip. Which I did.

I guess I’ll be jumping ship soon anyways. The place is falling apart and the owners can’t figure anything out. If any employee in any department left right now it’d be disastrous for the restaurant. I already know that at least two other vital employees are planning to quit pretty soon as well because of how undervalued we all are. The owners have zero grasp of the concept of morale and how much it affects your business and the loyalty of your employees. I’ll be happy to leave this place behind me and watch it crumble shortly thereafter.

The new place I started at a few months ago has been a completely different experience for me. I feel overwhelmingly valued, management is committed to supporting their staff, and the business is off the charts. I’m doing well.

I missed too much class to reasonably still complete. Three full weeks of missed senior level classes. I had to drop out due to this condition.

I was also let go at my prestigious internship because they only hire a time students.

throwaway_101819,2019-10-18 13:35:06+00:00,"I just moved, and a neighbor putting up flyers accusing me of being a child molester. I am not. New York State.","So I moved into a new neighborhood in August. Shortly after I moved in, flyers started appearing on utility poles etc, alerting the residents that a child sexual predator has moved to the neighborhood. The flyer contains a cropped screenshot of the person they are ""mistaking"" me for's entry on the sex offender registry - we do share a name, but that's it. My name is not uncommon - I'm not Joe Smith but I am not Eusebius Cadmarenious either. Either way, the person posting these is definitely aware of the fact that it's not me, as they cropped the offender's mugshot out of the screenshot and replaced it with a picture from my LinkedIn profile. I have looked up Not-Me's entry on the sex offender registry, and he's a fat white guy in his sixties. I am an average build mixed dude (who looks black) in my thirties. And to be clear, while there's no such thing as a minor sex crime, this guy is on the registry for forcible rape of a child under 13 or something along those lines.

I spoke to the police as soon as I found out about the flyers via my wife, which must have been a fun surprise for her to see when she was walking home from the train. They basically said ""that sucks but how do you expect us to find out who is putting them up?"" I was confronted by a neighbor yesterday; luckily I bookmarked Not-Me's sex offender registry page on my phone, and the guy who confronted me was level headed enough to immediately apologize. He knew who was putting the flyers up, gave me the guy's name and described him as ""kind of a conspiracy nut."" Great. The abundant misspellings and CAPS for EMPHASIS on the flyer should have tipped me off. Anyway, I have no interest in confronting this guy myself, because there's a very low chance of the interaction ending in any manner that involves all of his teeth remaining in his head. I called the police again, and this time their take on it is more or less ""well being wrong isn't a crime, just keep taking the flyers down when you see them and try to ignore it."" This was last night.

Ignoring this isn't an option. I am planning on going to the department in person today when I get back from work. Has a crime been committed here, or is my only remedy going to be civil court? I feel like this is way beyond the standard type of libel that might fuck with my ability to get a job or something, as there's a non-zero chance that this kind of bullshit could lead to a vigilante type trying something.

[IL],"Last year I was laid off from my job due to the company phasing out my department. I was given a healthy severance which allowed me to pay off my student loan debt and car loan. It left me debt free and I found another job paying slightly more for the same kind of work about 6 weeks later.

Fast forward to Tuesday morning and I get a letter from what looks like a collection company. The claim I owe over $6000 for a credit card debt. After calling the credit card company directly, I learned a card was opened in my name last September and the address on the account is my dad's house 150 miles away.

I called my dad and asked him what was going on since I knew he hasn't really had his finances in order for most of his adult life. I'm polite with my step-mother but we aren't close at all as she hates my mother. My dad and I have never been super close but over the past couple years he's gotten even more distant, I think a lot of it has to do with my step-mother. Basically he admitted to opening the credit card in my name to buy a bracelet for his wife, a week long trip to Chicago and a few other things. He then had the nerve to tell me I could pay it off with my severance, which was the end of the phone call.

zoobylive,2019-10-17 01:48:55+00:00,**UPDATE: Damages Hearing / I WON!,"This is an update to my original post located at: [https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/di712z/damages\_hearing\_can\_i\_win\_my\_case/](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/di712z/damages_hearing_can_i_win_my_case/)

**Before the Courtroom**

I went in, prepared as much as possible. I entered the lobby outside of the courtroom 30 minutes early and checked in. I was getting more nervous by the minute. I had a solid case, but a slight bit of doubt that this could go either way. After all, I had never did this before.

The plaintiff walks in right on time and checks in herself. She sees me and approaches.

&gt;**Plaintiff**: Would you like to try to come up with a settlement with these damages?  
&gt;  
&gt;**Me**: First I'd like to ask why I never received a summons for this hearing. I gave you my forwarding address when we were here for the initial eviction hearing.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Plaintiff**: You should have received one. You should have gotten an electronic notice.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Me**: I didn't get any notice. Also why wasn't I mailed a copy of the damages in question. Shouldn't this have been done before the hearing?  
&gt;  
&gt;**Plaintiff**: No you'll receive one in the mail in the next week or two outlining exactly what's being charged and by how much.

Unsure if this is true or not, I was amazed. How am I supposed to properly defend myself when all I have to go on is what was said during the final walk-through. Maybe they found something to charge me since then? I wasn't sure, but I was sure of my case and that it was solid.

&gt;**Plaintiff**: Would you like to settle here or go before the judge?  
&gt;  
&gt;**Me**: I'd like to go before the judge.

The look on her face was priceless. Total shock as if she wasn't used to tenants wanting to challenge her in open court. In hindsight, I should have at least agreed to try and settle just so I knew all the damages she was going to be going after and then deciding from there to see the judge.

She informs the clerk that we'd like to see the judge and that we're not coming to a settlement. She proceeds to walk to the opposite end of the hall from where I'm sitting and tries her best to get organized. Again watching her I'm getting the strong impression she's not ready for this. She proceeds to spend the next 10-15 minutes writing things down on a notepad.

The time comes. We get told that we may enter the courtroom.

**Court Begins**

We enter court and sit down. After waiting a little while the judge walks in and we all stand. She tells us to be seated.

The judge tells the court that there will be two cases tried today. One being my case and the other is from another property management. I've never felt more confident in my life at this point. She then informs us she'll be starting with my case and has us sit at the defendant and plaintiff tables.

&gt;**Judge**: Plaintiff can you please state your name?  
&gt;  
&gt;**Plaintiff**: *Gives her name.*  
&gt;  
&gt;**Judge**: And you're a representative of *Property Management*?  
&gt;  
&gt;**Plaintiff**: That's correct, your Honor.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Judge**: And your name, Sir?  
&gt;  
&gt;**Me**: My name is *Gives my name*.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Judge**: According to my records we're here today for a back-rent / damages dispute. Plaintiff can you tell us what damages you are seeking?

At this point I'm opening up my folder. Spreading my documentation, evidence and outline all over the table. I have pictures, account ledger and everything I'd possibly need to answer the Judges questions quickly and efficiently.

&gt;**Plaintiff**: We're here to collect back-rent for two months. $300 for August and $550 for September. We also are here to collect late-fees. $250 for July, $250 for August &amp; $110 for September. Furthermore we are seeking $100 for administration fees and $100 for cleaning that needs to be done to the apartment.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Judge**: Defendant are you disputing these charges?  
&gt;  
&gt;**Me**: Some of them, your Honor.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Judge**: What charges are you disputing?  
&gt;  
&gt;**Me**: First I'd like to dispute the late fees. I realize Indiana doesn’t  have express limits on late fees with the exception they can’t be  unreasonable. My late fees in July &amp; August were both $250. My late fees in September were $110. Reasonable late fees are generally 10% of your rent on  the higher end. There are two months where the late fees accrued 45% of my rent. One month where it was 20%.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Judge**: How many days were you late in July?  
&gt;  
&gt;**Me**: Every day. I had lost my job prior.

Although embarrassing for me to admit how out of control it was; I kept my composure and we moved on.

&gt;**Judge**: Are you disputing anything else?  
&gt;  
&gt;**Me**: Yes, your Honor. I'm disputing the cleaning fees for the apartment. I have photo evidence of every room in the apartment before moving out. I've included zoom-in photos of the sink and bathtub which the plaintiff is claiming soap-scum and the need to have it professional cleaned.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Judge**: I'll accept this evidence. Please pass the pictures to the plaintiff so she may look at them.

I hand the picture to her. One by one she goes through them. She says out-loud the place was left in overall good condition. The only issues she had with it were the soap-scum and it may have needed mopped. Again I can't stress this enough but this apartment was 100% cleaner than when I received it.

The plaintiff then hands me the pictures back and the Judge motions me to bring them to her. I do and watch her flip through the pictures not saying a word.

It was a bit humorous but out of no where while the judge is looking at the photos the plaintiff calls out

&gt;""There is no pictures of the inside of the oven. It was dirty, your Honor.""

The Judge looks at me and asks if this was true. I respond with

&gt;""I've never used the oven since I moved in there. I don't know how to cook. If it was dirty that's the way it was when I moved in, your Honor.""

The Judge finishes reviewing the photos and asks if I'm disputing anything else. I answer with a simple ""No, your Honor.""

She looks one last time over the evidence, the itemized damages and back-rent, the late fees and my lease. She's about to make her judgement.

&gt;""As for back-rent for August and September in the total amount of $850 to be awarded to the plaintiff.""  
&gt;  
&gt;""As for cleaning fees to the apartment. These pictures show the apartment in well kept condition. You can't expect to charge the defendant for general wear and tear and that's what I see here. No money awarded.""  
&gt;  
&gt;""As far as administration fees. I don't see anything on the lease that would justify charging this. No money awarded.""  
&gt;  
&gt;""As for the late fees. The lease states $10.00 per day being late without a cap. You're asking for way too much. I'm going to allow 10% for the months of July, August and September making it $55 each month.""  
&gt;  
&gt;""Noticing you have a $550 Security Deposit that will leave your total to $465 plus court costs. Judgement for the plaintiff.

I couldn't believe it. Not only was it over but everything I challenged the Judge sided with me on. Although the judgement was for the plaintiff; I feel like I won. And I couldn't be happier watching the disappointment on the plaintiffs face as we left the court room.

tentimesthesky,2019-10-16 10:24:08+00:00,[MN] My ex-wife opened a credit card in my name ($2000 balance) to start selling makeup through a MLM scheme.,"We divorced back in January and it was fairly amicable, no kids and no spousal support. Since then, I learned she lost her job and had to move back in with her parents. I received a letter yesterday from a collection agency. On it is a credit card I’ve never had before and an “offer” to pay off the $2000+ balance for $1700. I called the number and asked what the hell it was about. After a couple minutes of back and forth, I learned one of the addresses they had in their system for my account came back to my ex-wife’s parents’ house. At this point I’m livid. I hung up and immediately called her.

I asked her if she opened a credit card in my name and I got a long-winded story about how she was going to start her own makeup consultancy business with a pyramid scheme company since she had to move back home. She needed to pay for the initial product, marketing materials and a car wrap. It cost her about $1700. Her “plan” was to use the money she was going to make to pay off the credit card and close the account. She can’t get a credit card due to some really bad financial decisions she made in her early 20s (she’s in her late 20s now).

Unsurprisingly (to me) nobody wanted to buy the makeup and she had no way of paying the credit card so she didn’t even try making a single payment. I laughed at how absurd it was, hung up, and sent her mom and dad a text about it and haven’t heard anything back. At this point, would I need to sue her to get my money back or would that be pointless since she has no assets of her own?",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dinbe2/mn_my_exwife_opened_a_credit_card_in_my_name_2000/,legaladvice,6188,58,0.0
Merle8888,2019-10-15 12:41:01+00:00,Bank refusing to return money stolen by convicted fraudsters,"At the beginning of this year, I had a break-in, in which my ID and checkbook were stolen. I immediately contacted my bank (Bank of America) to put a freeze on the account, and then opened a new account and put all of the money into it. The following day, money started disappearing from the new account. I went straight to the bank and removed all of my remaining money, but money continued disappearing while I was at the bank, the people involved making off with about $3000 by using my ID and going through the drive-through. I took the rest of my money to a different bank, and put in a claim for the stolen funds.

Bank of America didn't get back to me on my claim until 4-5 months later, at which point they returned some of the money, minus $1000. (At this point, I'd also had issues with bill pay bouncing checks off of all the institutions I had bills set up for, even though my account was both frozen and empty, and then had to deal with bounced-check fees from those merchants.) With the help of a local branch employee, we eventually figured out that the $1000 was a check that the fraudsters had bounced off of my account around the same time all of the other things were going on. (They'd written a check on the account of someone else whose ID and checks had been stolen.) I hadn't been aware of this check, because it hadn't posted to my account until several days after I'd removed all my money from it, and so I hadn't actually lost any money from this at the time. So, I put in a new claim for the remaining $1000.

Several more months pass, then Bank of America gets back to me with a form letter denying my claim because I was supposed to report the fraud within 60 days of its occurrence and hadn't done so. I have an appointment at the local branch again tomorrow to try to resolve this - though all the local branch people do is put in claims with a department elsewhere.

In the meanwhile, the fraudsters wound up getting arrested and pleading to some lesser charges with respect to ID thefts against a dozen or so people. The police weren't ever terribly communicative with me and I don't know the details of who did what or what type of evidence they have in my specific case. I assume the fraudsters have been spending their ill-gotten gains and wouldn't actually ever pay a judgment against them, if I could even prove which one was responsible for the bounced check.

I am feeling at the end of my rope here. So, Reddit, any advice on this situation? Am I out $1000 because I didn't report the bounced check within 60 days even though I had reported that fraud was occurring on the account and had frozen and emptied the account before the check ever posted? Shouldn't Bank of America have notified me that this activity occurred when my account was frozen and fraud had been reported? What is the best way to go about getting my money back? I've already had to miss a not-insignificant amount of work time meeting with folks at the local bank branch and the better part of a year has passed since the break-in, so I'm more than ready for all of this to finally be over.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/di7bl1/bank_refusing_to_return_money_stolen_by_convicted/,legaladvice,3599,61,0.0

At my ultrasound I found out I am pregnant with twins, and have a very large cyst on my ovary. Due to some pain I’ve been experiencing, my doctor informed me to take the weekend off and come in first thing Monday morning for another ultrasound to check on things. She assured me that they would provide a medical excuse form to miss work and even offered to talk to my boss over the phone to explain why I needed to stay off my feet. 
I of course called out, informed my boss what was going on and apologized for the inconvenience but explained about the medical note excusing me from working (I have never had any problems calling off work with a note from a doctor). My boss then calls me back, screaming about how I am a waste of her time and told me I’m done, my pregnancy is not her problem, I’m off the schedule. Confirmed by another coworker yesterday that she actually did take me off completely.  

I don’t know what to do. I just needed a couple days off to make sure everything is ok with my babies. I am a waitress and the doctor told me flat out I can’t be moving around like that while it’s up in the air. I have worked as a server through both my previous pregnancies, I’m perfectly capable of doing it. I wasn’t quitting, I told her over and over that I’d have a doctors note and would know more about the situation on Monday. 

I absolutely cannot afford to not have a job. I just bought a house, have two other children and just can’t afford this. Is there anything I can do? I don’t really want to work for her anymore but no one is going to hire a high risk pregnant person. Looking for advice. Is this even legal?",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dgyhd2/fired_for_being_pregnant/,legaladvice,1209,67,0.0
Firm_Palpitation,2019-10-12 15:50:01+00:00,Fired for anti china/pro HK comments on social media.,"Location: New Jersey (USA)

Preface: I work for a company that deals heavily with a lot of Asian countries, basically anywhere that had cheap labor we worked with, China was no exception and in the eyes of our company, China was seen as one of our largest assets however. 

Was fired yesterday. Was given the explanation from my DM who said that they were making ""cuts"" from the company I worked for.  Basically told me to gather my shit and leave. Whatever I was over working there anyway. 

&amp;#x200B;

However this morning (about a half an hour ago exactly) I get a text message from a friend who mentioned overhearing a discussion in the office when he was punching in for the day basically saying to keep any political opinions about Hong Kong ""In the bedroom"" and if its reported they will lay MORE people off. 

Now this made me think because I had a coworker actually commented on one of my posts that I had shared about Tienanmen Square massacre (some stupid ""Never forget"" post thats making it rounds)  Coworker got very defensive on my post about China and I mostly just ignored it as I knew that her opinion wasn't one I usually agreed with. She however got very emotional in the comment and even asked me to remove the post completely in my DM's afterwards, which I didn't do. 

If I was able to have my coworker get my other coworker to confess she reported me to my DM, would I have any actual legal backing here? IS this something companies are allowed to even fire people for? Is my DM allowed to lie about my termination to me?",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dgwv6d/fired_for_anti_chinapro_hk_comments_on_social/,legaladvice,4518,70,0.0
MrCheapCheap,2019-10-12 00:09:08+00:00,*UPDATE* textbook scam,"Good news! I posted a week or so ago about a company that sent me a different textbook then the one in the photo, and claimed the international version was  specified in the description. Then was demanding me send it to Malaysia (it came from USA before) for return, which would have cost as much as the book (the book was over $100). I sent many emails, then they did not respond for a couple days, conveniently those couple days were the last couple days in the 'refund time', meaning the book was no longer eligible for a refund. To say the least I was not happy. My bank said they could not do anything (I was given that advice on here), so I researched the Canadian Government on consumer laws. Shortly after this I had reported this company to the consumer laws in my district. They replied with 'Thank you for bringing this to our attention', and within 5 hours I recieved an email from the company with a full refund with the book still sitting on my table.

 I was hired here by 2 of the District Coaches. I was trained at one of their higher performing stores for 6 weeks as an Assistant Restaurant Manager. The District Manager/Coach tried to brief me on how the store/location I was being assigned is underperforming and would like me to apply what I learned through all training. He told me there were people they wanted to get rid of and that they really needed help. They needed someone consistent even though it could get frustrating. And trust me it is! When I meet my GM he pretty much was saying the same thing. He wanted to get rid of problem people. 
So I go in applying my training on rules, proper portioning and service quality long story short Ive been meet with sooo much opposition. Apparently this location has been ""cheating"" they have been doing things their way for so long that im a complete disruption to their whole system.  Ive been keeping the District Manager/Coach informed of all the things they do that they are not supposed too and he in turn wants wants me to keep ""Nipping at the Bit"" or whatever he calls it. Trust me when I say they (the location) hates me! 

The upcoming Investigation:
At some point after I count my safe on the 9th and when the morning manager counted their safe on the 10th $100 went missing. 
We use the ""Crew"" app, an app for Employers to chat with employees. My fellow managers and my GM are strongly implying i took this money and my GM is also implying ""Someone"" will be terminated they wont come and say its me but the language and the obviously specifc details imply its me. 
The thing is im actually very computer Savvy.  I was able to run a report on the safe that documented everytime it was opened and by whom. I found through my own ivestigation that 2 Managers had gone into the safe between counts. 

I dont think  anyone knows how to run these reports or I probably wont have been harrassed about all this the way I am, I honestly believe they just want to try to get rid of me. 
When I present this report tomorrow during their investigation Im afraid that when the GM sees its one of his buddies that was actually in the safe last, he will not be willing to punish the individual so harshly.

Is there any thing I can do legally If my GM doest punish the individual to the full extent he was soo willing to punish me?

I purchased a car Saturday in Massachusetts. I paid 10k in a bankers check and financed the remainder. Upon pickup on Tuesday,  I was told I was given a rebate (which was not in any of my paperwork) that I was not entitled to. The dealership told me I need to pay $500 or else I can't have the vehicle. At this point, I already had a contract, the keys to the vehicle, had the vehicle insured, signed over the title to my old vehicle...everything I needed aside from registration. As far as I was concerned it was my property at the time. After a verbal back and forth the salesman got tough and told me to back down or he would F me up etc etc. After threatening me, I told him he couldn't do that. He then rushed me and violently pushed me . At that point, for my own safety, I tackled him and we were separated by all the other employees. During the separation he hit me several more times because I was the only individual restrained by the other employees. The other employees collected my paperwork that was lost in the altercatiin and shredded it. The police were called and I filed a report. I have yet to press charges. I declined to initially because after the altercation they had possession of my $10k, my new car and the title to my old car. I had no paperwork other thank the bankers check made to and cashed by the company, and an autopolocy with associated VIN.  Police told me they couldn't help with the civil side regarding the cars and money, only the assault. If I filed for assault I couldn't help but think i would have been out that money and both cars for a long time as the civil thing plays out.  I sustained a potentially broken nose and a medium cut to the knee... and what sucked the most for me...the brand new watch, which my wife gave me little more than 3 weeks ago as a gift on our wedding day...is destroyed.

anonymice75,2019-10-10 15:13:39+00:00,"Fired in Texas for taking prescribed meds at home, yeehaw!","Long time lurker, 1st time poster.  Apologies for the upcoming wall of text.  TLDR at the end.

Several weeks ago I had a random follicle test at work, no prob, I've passed several before with this same employer.  However, in good faith I reported to my supervisor that I've been taking CBD.  Since it's not regulated by the FDA, that I'm aware of, I let them know, since I wasnt sure how that would look on the follicle test.  My concern was that since it's not regulated, I wasnt sure that there would be zero THC in the CBD.  Supervisor took this info to HR, as he should have.  The next day, I was sent home and scheduled a visit with a substance abuse counselor that HR referred me to.

HR requested my prescription records, as they have after my past follicle tests, and I complied.  I currently take an opioid 2-3 times per week in the evening, as prescribed by my physician.  I've had osteoarthritis in my lumbar and pelvis since age 30, have tried various medications, procedures, PT, chiropractic treatments, but I digress.

Had the meeting with the counselor, starting paperwork at 4:30pm, and left the appointment at 9pm.  She recommended 3 weeks inpatient detox.  FOR TAKING ONE 7.5MG HYDROCODONE 2 OR 3 EVENINGS A WEEK.  

I contacted HR, asking for outpatient treatment, as I have 3 minor children, and I wanted to keep my job.  I also asked why we didn't run into this issue the previous times I submitted my prescription records, when I was taking a higher dose more frequently.  HR was unable to answer that question, and also advised to visit the inpatient facility.

I visited the facility, complete with meth addicts and alcoholics, and submitted a urine sample to them.

Once I returned home, I contacted HR again, asking again for outpatient services, at a facility near me, that has counseling from 9am-1pm, 4 days a week, in hopes that I would be home in the evenings to care for my family.  Note that the outpatient location is run by the same hospital system that runs the inpatient on the other side of town.  HR did not give me an answer on this, but I was told at that time that my follicle test came back negative for THC.  Fantastic!

I received a call from my supervisor a few days later, scheduling an appointment at work.  I arrive to find my supervisor and an HR representative, and was told I was being terminated for not complying with the counselor's reccomendation.  I asked why, since I had passed my drug test.  This was news to my supervisor, as his head whipped towards the HR rep when I said I passed.  The HR rep was unable to answer my question.  

I went home, submitted a claim for unemployment, not knowing how that would turn out since I was fired.  I'm in Texas, an ""at-will"" state, where you can be terminated for no reason at all.  Last week I had a phone interview with the TWC agent researching my claim, and found out this week that I have been granted benefits as my firing was not due to on the job misconduct.

I have a family member that is offering to send me to a lawyer to sue my employer for wrongful termination.  My question to you all is...would I have a snowball's chance in hell of anything coming from this?  Can an employer involve themselves in my medical treatment when it has no negative effect on my work performance?

TLDR: Fired from my job for taking physician prescribed medication while at home, when my employer already knew about this for 8 years, and they had no issue with it on previous follicle tests.

Note:  I have had zero safety incidents on the job, and excellent performance reviews.  Thanks for reading.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dfzfx8/fired_in_texas_for_taking_prescribed_meds_at_home/,legaladvice,1643,93,0.0
CUAtThePartyRichter1,2019-10-10 10:12:26+00:00,Abandoned Vehicle sticker placed weekly on my vehicle.,"I live in a suburban neighborhood and park my vehicle outside of my house.

My roommate uses the driveway for his two cars and my 2001 pickup is parked on the street. 

I occasionally come out to find a 48 hour towing notice of abandoned vehicle on my driver side window. 

It can be a pain to remove since you have to use olive oil and scrape it off. It takes about 30min to an hour of my day.

It usually happens on Sunday evening when I'm home and I won't notice it until I leave for work on Monday.

I spoke to the officer on the phone once since I could contact him through the incident number at the city PD. I explained to him I park it in the same place everyday, of course it looks like it doesn't move. He just kept reiterating that it needed to be driven everyday... which it is. So I asked him if he could draw chalk on the tires to see that the truck is indeed driven, but he said that they skip that and just put the sticker on since it's not a case they are going to follow up on. Then he told me that it's clearly a problem since one of my neighbors keeps reporting it anonymously on the city PD's website.

So I started parking it in front of different neighbors houses, since parking it in the same spot looks like it's static to that anonymous neighbor. But even when I park and walk 2-3 houses away in different places everytime I've driven home from work, I still occasionally get the orange sticker.

What can I do? Leave a note in the window every single day with ""last driven on DATE""? This is getting exhausting.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dfvvq5/abandoned_vehicle_sticker_placed_weekly_on_my/,legaladvice,1406,93,0.0

FTThrowAway123,2019-10-08 21:53:56+00:00,"[UPDATE] My friend was drugged at a bar, has evidence, but police refuse to investigate. What can she do?","Update to [Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/df2d8q/my_friend_was_drugged_at_a_bar_has_evidence_but/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)  

I took the advice from some posters on my original post, and decided we would work on getting security video from the bar ourselves. My friend and I went to the bar as soon as they opened this afternoon. The owner wasn't there, but a nice older woman was bartending and when we explained what happened, and that we just wanted to see if they caught anything on video, she had no problem showing us. I'm still shaking, but it WAS caught it on video, clear as day!!   

At 10:30 PM, my friend walked me out, went back to her seat, picked up and placed her drink on a shelf behind the bar, and went to the bathroom. The bartender was already outside smoking with several customers, and the only other patrons in there were an elderly man playing the slot machines way on the other side of the place, a woman who was standing at the internet jukebox with her back to the bar, and a man seated at the bar. He rummaged around his pockets a bit, glancing back and forth, and very casually reached his hand over the bar and dumped something into her glass (I don't think it was a solid pill, based on the ""dumping"" motion), then picked up the TV remote. He made it seem like he was just reaching for the remote, but you can *clearly* view some kind of dumping motion right above her glass. About 5 seconds later she emerges from the bathroom and retrieves her glass and begins to drink it. He left shortly afterwards. 17 minutes later she called me because she was feeling sluggish and way more intoxicated than she should, and she left while on the phone with me. He isn't seen again until about 45 minutes later, which I described in another comment, but basically he comes in, orders a drink, walks around the place looking around, makes an obscene gesture to a lady whose sitting with her boyfriend (behind his back), and then just leaves without drinking his drink, and isn't seen again. This guy was driving a crappy old truck with a home made paint job painted on the entire truck, with a business name spray painted on the side. It's a VERY noticeable vehicle. The bartender immediately knew who it was (first name only). I looked up the website from the truck and got a phone number. **So now we have**: *Clear and identifiable video of him actually tampering with her drink* (We took cellphone video of the security video, because the bartender didn't know how to make copies and ""didn't want to mess with it""), photos of his vehicle, license plates, a first name, a possible phone number (we didn't call it, and not planning to), a website (the business name seems to be a DBA name, I already searched our state database to see if it was a registered company, and nothing came up), in addition to her lab test results from the hospital. I noticed several squad cars driving past the bar while we were there, and I know they all have dash cams rolling while they're out patrolling, so even the police could probably independently place him at the bar during that time frame.  

Right now we are backing up and making hard copies of the evidence we have, and a burned copy of the security video we recorded. We plan to go back to the police station this evening, to give them all of the information we've collected. We will beg them to investigate this if we have to. Based on how they've treated her so far, I really want to record this interaction, because it's just been so unbelievable and nobody would believe us, but I'm not sure if recording police inside the PD is legal or not. I honestly wish there was some kind of resource for victims of crimes who could help us communicate with the police better, because clearly we must have done or said something wrong.  

I'm hoping that by handing over this information, my friend will be able to get justice and peace of mind. It's horrible to think of what might have happened to her if she wasn't so quick to realize what was happening and call for help. It's equally horrifying to think of how many times this person may have done this, or will do it to other people.  I will post an update if/when there is any developments in this situation.

dashcamfacebook,2019-10-08 16:57:37+00:00,(Ohio) I posted dashcam footage of a guy freaking out in his car behind me to Facebook. The guy is threatening to get a lawyer and sue me for invading his privacy. Real thing to be worried about?,"A few days ago I was at a four way stop sign intersection. To my right there was a black suburban who didn't go when it was his turn (looked like he was on his phone). I waited (to me) an obscenely long time for him to go before I finally went. He finally decided to go when I went and as a result from his point of view I would imagine he thought I cut him off. He was pretty pissed and tailgated me for about two miles on my way to work and screamed and yelled out the window like a maniac.

I have a very good rear-facing dash cam and recorded all this in HD. His face is pretty clearly visible in the video and he looks like a lunatic. I posted the video to the Facebook group for my local suburb with the commentary ""if anybody knows this guy, tell him to chill out."" I will say his license plate is NOT visible in the clip I posted.

Long story short, the video got back to him and he's messaging me through his wife's Facebook account, threatening to call the cops and get a lawyer saying I breached his privacy by posting the video.

There's no sort of presumption of privacy in public, correct?

He's also threatening to tell the cops I ran the stop sign when my front facing dash cam clearly shows me coming to a complete stop and waiting 21 seconds for him to go before I went. So I'm not worried about any sort of traffic citation for going before him at the intersection.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/df2s74/ohio_i_posted_dashcam_footage_of_a_guy_freaking/,legaladvice,1634,104,0.0
FTThrowAway123,2019-10-08 16:27:18+00:00,"My friend was drugged at a bar, has evidence, but police refuse to investigate. What can she do?","Last night, my friend (30F) was drugged at a local bar we go to on occasion, after work. The bar is a few blocks away from her house. I can confirm she was not drinking at work before this. We each had one drink (tap beer), and then I went home. She had ordered a second beer, and was going to finish that and walk home.  About 15 minutes later, I get a call from her saying she feels extremely intoxicated, warm, and like her limbs are heavy, and she knew something wasn't right. Just in the brief phone conversation we had, I could hear her speech rapidly deteriorating, and asked her where she was, which she had a difficult time communicating to me. I quickly sent my husband out to find her, but he had no luck. She also said a man she didn't know was walking a quarter block behind her, and she turned on her cellphone light and pointed it at this person and pretended she was recording. The person then turned around and walked away. She started slurring more and more, and then the line went quiet. I called her mom, who rushed there and found her staggering on the sidewalk on a side street. Her mom took her to the police department, at which point my friend was pretty incoherent and on the verge of unconscious. Her mom says the police were very dismissive, implying she'd simply had too much to drink and was too embarrassed to admit it to her mom. (Which is ridiculous, she's a grown woman and doesn't hide the fact that she has an occasional drink) They advised her that if she really felt like she'd been drugged, to go to the ER and have blood and urine tests done, which she did. The tests showed a BAC under the legal limit, and a high concentration of benzodiazepines, which they seemed to think was Xanax (or similar). My friend does not have a prescription for, nor does she take Xanax recreationally.  The only logical conclusion we can find is that someone slipped it into her drink when she used the bathroom. My friend was discharged and when she woke up this morning, I took her to the police department again, armed with her lab test results.  

Shockingly, the police either don't believe her, or don't care. They kept asking her over and over again if she drank too much or popped a few Xanax, and no matter how many times she insists that no, she had 1.5 beers and that's it, they aren't having it. They said things like, ""Why would someone drug you? Especially when you were with a friend?"" (I wasn't there for the last 15 minutes or so) ""Did anyone commit any crime against you? What exactly do you want us to do about this? Do you know who may have done this, and do you have any evidence?"" The whole bar is covered with security cameras, which we explicitly told them over and over and over again. Whoever did this, would have been caught on video. But apparently they don't think it's worth looking into???   We left with a pretty clear message that this wasn't going to be investigated, and my friend bawling and feeling very dejected and discouraged.  

I'm just absolutely stunned and really disgusted and disappointed in their attitude about all of this.  My question is, what can she even do? They made it seem like drugging someone isn't a crime unless they were assaulted afterwards, which I can't believe is true, but I don't know the law well enough to say with certainty. Is drugging someone without their consent a crime? Does she need to hire an attorney to advocate for her? What recourse does a person have when the police ignore a report of a crime, even with evidence?    

This happened in Wisconsin.  Thank you for your advice.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/df2d8q/my_friend_was_drugged_at_a_bar_has_evidence_but/,legaladvice,1594,47,0.0
fastbutsafe333,2019-10-07 20:17:58+00:00,Received a reckless driving ticket on my private property road/driveway,"Before anyone gets upset about the speed, this is a gated off private road / driveway. There was zero chances of another car being on it unless they broke through a locked gate and trespassed on clearly marked private property.

So my driveway is in a weird spot that goes alongside a highway for about 4 miles before turning off and up towards the house.  The entire property is fenced off and  gated/posted private property no trespassing. It is about 800 feet from the highway and slowly moves further and further from the highway.


I use my driveway as a place to work out kinks in my cars, get them setup properly etc before going to the dragstrip. I love cars and try to do things as safely as possible, roll cages, proper harnesses and helmet etc. I never open them up on the road because I have no need to, I can do it on my own private property.

Anyways last night I was having fun with my newly broken in engine swapped car. Doing a few runs back and forth and after the 6th or 7th run down I notice a cop with lights on sitting down at the gate. I head down and tell him I'll be right back, I have to go get the key to the gate but he insists I stay there. So I stay and he demands license, registration, insurance. I tell him I have none of those on me, and the car isn't even registered or insured (I bring it to and from the track/strip on a trailer).

So he just gets my information from my name, dob, address etc. I ask him why he's even here because this isn't a road, why is he stopping me. He tells me reckless driving and he has me on laser doing 162, I start to argue that this is a private road/driveway clearly because he's sitting behind a locked gate and how can I be recklessly driving on private property? He starts telling me I can goto jail if I keep arguing, after about 20 minutes of just standing at my gate he gives me a ticket to sign for reckless driving. The ticket doesn't even have a posted speed for the road on it because this isn't a road.

What do I need to bring to the court date to show this isn't a road and he has no jurisdiction to enforce traffic laws on? I'm not trying to cause a huge issue but it's kind if stupid he even gave me a ticket, I didn't feel like continuing to argue with him because it was going nowhere.

Helstromme,2019-10-07 19:20:25+00:00,Update: Dying of a mysterious lung disease.,"TLDR: I'm finally getting help.

Since my last post, I've talked to several people who were extremely helpful to my situation to include the upper CoC of medical, the senator, some lawyers, the state's Department of Health and the EPA. I figured ""fuck it, if I'm dying I have nothing to really lose"" and threw a hail Mary.

The doctors still have no clue yet what it may be, but the next round of testing for parasites, autoimmune diseases and independent mold inspections for my housing situation has commenced.

I was reassigned to a new PCM who was previously an internal medicine specialist so they had a foot in the door to get me looked at and actually took the time to collect a list of ***ALL*** my issues then started treating/evaluating me for them. They aren't fatal (which is why they've gone neglected, Navy medicine is very reactionary) but my quality of life will improve considerably.

I moved here from Colorado when I was 8 months pregnant with my baby,  since then things have gone down hill, but my baby's currently 10 months old.  This happened today, and there's a lot to unpack, so any type of advice is welcome. 
I have a ten month old baby that my partner and I are supposed to take turns watching while the other is at work. I work part time during the days, and he works full time at nights. 
Since my baby was born he's completely neglected her unless we have company over. He'll leave her in her crib with the lights off and door closed for hours at a time while I'm at work without checking on her. Many times I'll get home from work and she'll be swollen from crying and covered in poop. It's gotten to the point where I've started leaving bottles in her crib with her just so she can eat while I'm gone. 
Today I asked him to watch her while I go to church with a friend, and while I was gone he not only ignored my child, he threw my kitten outside in the cold for hours before she finally ""escaped her kennel."" Since meeting him he's gotten rid of three cats, each one was an I'm sorry present for the last one he got rid of. 
I immediately packed my child and left to stay at a friend's house.
He called me four times on my phone while I was sobbing in the living room to bring him something to drink from the kitchen, with no remorse. 
Today I took our shared car, that's under my name, and he's called the cops on me. As well as threatened me with legal action he's been going to all my friends houses to try and find my child and I. 
He'll push my daughter if she tries climbing on him while he plays video games, and will yell at her if she touches him when he fails asleep on the couch after playing video  games. He throws things at our dog, hit me so hard it left welts, and has broken numerous things around our home, and opened/ maxed out three lines of credit with my information promising to pay it off. 
Tl;dr My partner consistently neglects our baby and expects me to be his mom, while taking care of all the house work. We currently rent an apartment, and I have $30k of debt he's wracked up in my name. My mom who lives in Colorado has offered for me to stay with her rent free if I move back.  I'm going to the police in the morning to report the situation, but I want to know what I can do with the debt, how to get out of the apartment, if I can get in throuble for removing my child, and if I can take my daughter out of the state.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/deh3bf/i_called_cps_on_my_partner_for_neglect_and_took/,legaladvice,1060,68,0.0

Sorry if this is the wrong forum for this question,"We have struggled with liquor cost, but we have gotten it under control they gave us a goal of 20% cost and now it’s at 18%, which is pretty amazing for a bar that does happy hour for 9 hits of the day. For example, the owners see that over a week, while pouring thousands of ounces of vodka we are missing 4 bottles of vodka for the week.  This is less than 3% of the overall vodka poured and since we are high volume and use free pouring, in any other restaurant I have worked or helped, it would be considered cost of doing business. If you do the math, it equates to us pouring about 1.57 ounces instead of 1.5 ounces as we are allotted for each pour. Since we use imprecise pouring tools and we are far to high volume to use jiggers (a liquor measuring tool)  it doesn’t seem right that they would be allowed to charge us for these overages. They intend on holding back our tips and charging us anything that they decide is missing every night. Is that even legal?

The daughter is a music student and we constantly have to hear her playing guitar or keyboard WITH AN AMP, singing (more like screeching) into a microphone, and producing shitty beats with too much base. 

She plays music WAY louder than she needs to to practice. Its louder than our TV much of the time.

Don’t know if that was directly related to this but I’ll take it. 

Thanks again for the advice. Just a quick aside, after the post was locked I got MANY personal messages telling me to contact the Shomrim.

Mercantibaby,2019-10-04 04:36:35+00:00,My tenant cut down trees in my yard. Including my apple tree,"We live in BC Canada.  

So here's the story. 

Renters moved in May 15. They asked that we take the house off the market, they will sign a two year lease and pay $2000 a month, $100 more than we were asking for. Immediately they were late paying rent and since then, have not paid rent on time once. Numerous messages every month with excuses as to why rent couldn't be paid on time.  June 7 he asked me to pay someone to care for the yard because they couldn't afford a lawn mower. I reminded them that it was in the rental agreement that they care for the yard because we are 10 hours away and that we need a somewhat self sufficient tenant. More months of late rent and complaints about small issues which we immediately attended to by sending someone in (furnace filter needed changing, toilet ring needed replacing in both bathrooms, dryer needed to be cleaned) 

July 21 he messages me about pruning the trees and cutting and getting rid of them. I clearly stated in text that he was not allowed to cut the trees down. 

Sept 14 we have friends come visit and tell us our grass is about 3 feet tall so I send this message to my tenant ""Hey Chris, could you please now the lawn or at least pay someone to mow it and clean it up. Just got a call from a neighbor concerned that the place isn't being cared for. Said the lawn was out of control""

He proceeds to bitch that the yard has been a disaster since he moved in in the spring and that he shouldn't have to do a dump run for the garbage in the yard. The ""garbage"" I explained were painted decorative tires for growing potatoes with the garden and if he wasn't going to use them he could store them in one of the 3 sheds but to not throw them out. 

Today Oct 3 he sends me pictures saying he cleaned up the yard and I see that my apple tree in the front yard is missing and the choke cherry tree in the back yard is also missing. He did NOT have permission to cut them down, I explained this to him and he says ""I did not touch either of the big trees anymore than I showed you a couple of months ago and you had no problem then. If you are not happy I apologize but you told me to deal with the yard so I dealt with it so that I was happy with the way the yard looked. Sorry we didn't know the tree in the front yard was to stay. We checked it and it hadn't produced anything. ""

We pruned the apple tree end of last summer so of course it won't produce apples this season!!

Now he is trying to get out of his lease by telling me to evict him but I want repayment for my trees. It was stated in the least that they weren't allowed to remove any permanent fixtures pertaining to the property without written consent from us.

ThrowAwayNew098,2019-10-03 02:44:48+00:00,[NY] Mother likely murdered and father missing. No idea what to do next.,"The short story of my situation is that my mother was likely killed by my father and he is currently missing. I’m not even sure where to begin on getting everything sorted but here are the few questions I have right now. 


1.	What happens financially? I think my parents were in debt but do I have to pay that? I have no idea how much money they had in the bank, but does that need to go towards the debt. 
2.	My brother is still in high school. I can take care of him, I’m old enough and I think ok financially for now. I assume I’ll be able to take custody but how will that work if my father is not found. I think I’ve also heard that I may be able to collect social security for him. 
3.	Kind of similar to the previous questions but my parents had a house. What can be done with that? I have no idea what it’s worth, I know that money is still owed on it.  I want to get rid of it, but for the mean time should I continue to pay mortgage on it?
4.	My father had a 401k, if he is not found what can be done with it? In a similar vein my mother had a pension. Will they pay out the pension to my brother or something till he is of age? Or does that vary?
5.	This one I can probably answer myself, but a lot of bills were in my mothers name (phone, car insurance, card, etc.). I assume with a death certificate I can transfer all that stuff? Should I even worry about all of their bills for things that do not matter anymore, like a gym membership for example. 


I know I’ll need to contact a lawyer for help with some of these questions, I am working on that but am wondering if anyone here had some quick answers to help ease my mind. Im trying to figure out what my next steps would be but it’s all really overwhelming right now. Also, if any one has any other advice on things I’m not even thinking of please let me know.

Original Post Here - https://old.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/3ysp6t/virginia_being_sued_due_to_separation_from/

Wow, I still cannot believe that this took 2.5 years to deal with. Fuck me, I am tired. This was all settled a few weeks ago. 

So we left off with Old Company threatening to sue me. [Your surprised faced when you learn they followed through with a lawsuit against both me and New Employer.](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-tEjzh3Zdf_Q/V1ltIj4pt0I/AAAAAAAAheY/Xm9QfrhOWxkKv85iKg5vHfWRBMIV-0XZgCLcB/s1600/63594749.jpg) 

Old Company ended up taking us to court, their demands were that not only I stop selling to former customers for 4 years, but that New Company give them the gross profit as a ""finders fee."" They also made demands around me never speaking with their new sales people (I cannot help when one calls me), and they pushed for me to exit the industry for 4 years too. Their demands were all over the place.

New Company has a bright, young, and eager corporate lawyer who was itching to get on top of this. First he tried to meet with Old Company's lawyer, that went about as good as you can imagine. He then sent them pages, and pages of documentation as well as a few sworn statements from customers that they never want to do business with Old Company ever again. So they ended up agreeing to drop the suit and pay for New Company's Lawyers time.

Phufff...of course that did happen. They doubled down! This time Old Company leadership apparently started harassing and threatening some ""current"" (at the time current) and former customers that if they did business with me, that they would be sued too, their services would be suspended, etc. Just a whole shit storm was created. 

So bringing it all together, Old Company still exists (honestly, I do not know how), and the Judge ended up more or less telling them ""tough shit"" with business coming to me/New Company and it leaving Old Company. Statements by customers were damning and basically lost the case for them. Yelling at customers and threatening to sue them on baseless accusations is not a solid strategy to one's business growth plans. Who knew right?

Judge tossed out the case with, his words ""Extreme Prejudice!"" and that he did not want to see this case come back to his courtroom ever again. 

I am still employed at New Company, and have moved into a Sr. Sales Management role. I am no longer an individual contributor. 

My spidey senses are telling me that this is not the last time we are going to have to legally wrangle with Old Company. 

After we won, Sr leadership from New Company took the legal team and me out to a very nice dinner, and thanked us all. Especially me for maintaining such professionalism, hence my new role now.

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/d9t0ez/today_i_came_home_to_a_new_fence_in_my_backyard/)

I found the fence on Thursday. Saturday I was having about a dozen people over for a family birthday party so the eyesore of a fence had to go, one way or another. So on Friday morning, I had a follow-up call with the realtor who knew nothing about the fence, and he told me that the homeowner didn't either. I called my neighborhood civil council president to let him know about it, and he told me about encroachment issues (as the fence was on my property), but also let me know that in my city, a permit is not required to build this type of fence.

I took many commenters' advice and installed security cameras around my house, two of which have either full or partial view of the neighboring backyard.

I also took to heart the idea that there may be squatters living or preparing to live in the house next door. If I find anything on my security cameras indicating there may be squatters, I'll be informing the police.

So, on Friday afternoon, I removed the fencing in its multiple different pieces and gently leaned them against the brick garage, with the exception of one door-sized section, which I put against the basement door in case there are indeed squatters entering through there. Saturday, Sunday, and Monday came and went without any indication that the yard was entered again, and the fencing over the basement door hasn't moved.

We still don't know who built the fence or why, but it doesn't seem like anyone cares, and at least now I don't have an abomination of a fence to stare at anymore. I will likely build my own fence though, one that looks good and is structurally sound, and that spans my property line.

Thanks to everyone for your input and advice, and if I learn who built the fence I will be sure to update again!",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dbw3eg/update_today_i_came_home_to_a_new_fence_in_my/,legaladvice,9440,3,0.0

This same family member did the same thing to my brother a few years ago, with his balance being almost twice my own. As far as legal action goes, I just want to know where I can take this.

If the meeting doesnt go in the direction that Im hoping it will, since he has the reputation of being an impotent shill, then I'm hoping/planning to get an attorney involved.

 Are there any state or federal laws that might prohibit this level of negligence towards personal hygiene, besides the fact that this can be clearly seen as a psychological problem, and are there any laws related to this which would make a domicile uninhabitable.

Randythecatcher,2019-09-29 22:29:48+00:00,"[PA] An HOA that wants to build a housing development on my farmland is acting as if they own my land and are making it quite public, they are forcing me and my family out, what can I do","I own a large farm that spreads over 578 acres. My largest field is 498 acres. In the past month or so a group that is trying to build a housing development in my area announced that it had found the perfect place to build the development. It was my Farm.

We made several attempts to discuss with them that we are not giving up our farm and their offer of 100,000 dollars was a fraction of its estimated value and the fact that in the time they want us out is a week before we are set to harvest the crop.

Then on Friday I noticed two news vans were driving down the main road towards the corner of my field. So I drove over and found that the people running the project are setting up a GROUNDBREAKING PARTY!?!

They had set up a portable stage on my crops had a DJ set up on a flatbed that was driven over my crops. We thought they had given up and dropped our guard only to find out that they had been pre selling the homes to people before the foundations were even set. This party was apparently for the people who had pre bought the houses.

I immediately shooed the news away and called the police. The HOA claimed that we agreed on a deal and we were set to move out last week. This was a lie, as Friday was a month ahead of the preferred day.

The police said there was nothing they could do as this matter requires a lawyer.

mimimart,2019-09-29 07:43:58+00:00,"TSA detained, roughly handled my terminally ill father and his port, causing us to go to the ER and possibly miss out on experimental treatment.","I'm going to try to state this as calmly as possibly.

My father has cancer, walks with a cane/wheelchair, and has a [port](https://www.cancer.gov/images/cdr/live/CDR756805-750.jpg) for his treatments that is a tube from the side of his chest going to his heart.  We came to this country 20 years ago, both my parents speak english well with an accent that is not so thick people have difficulty understanding them in our city (New York) facing the customer directly at our shop. They sometimes get syntaxes, plurals, and slang wrong, but it's not hard to figure out, my father read the times daily and has given lectures at a college. I'll gladly post an audio clip of them speaking if needed. However, the cancer and medication make him very soft spoken, and his hearing isn't that great (he's nearly 70) and when very upset or flustered, can have a hard time finding the right words. 
 

Today, they were flying from TN (I don't want to name the airport yet, but if needed will do) where my sister and her family live, to Houston, TX, where my father is undergoing some experimental treatments for his cancer.   He had permission to travel, and with him brings a note from his oncologist from home (Brooklyn, NY) and in Texas, which includes a diagram of the port but not a full list of medication (which I will request from his doctors tomorrow)  He also brings a printout from the TSA about traveling with a port and cancer which I will find the exact link to when I get more info.  

My parents arrive 3:45 to a Tennessee airport for a 6:00 flight. 
Both parents have TSA pre and get on line at about 4. They are told to get out into the other line, they show their tickets, and the agent consults another while they wait, the other agents letting people past them.  The agents start questioning my father on where he is going, his name, the address on the ID, etc.  My father is having difficulty understanding the agents accent, which is very thick, and the agent is responding by speaking louder and louder and more drawn out, making it even harder to understand. Meanwhile I assume he is not speaking his best English, either, as he is flustered and has been standing a while now, but he is trying his best. I'm not sure if they asked about the port at this point but my father tries to give them the info and doctors note he has brought, which I think adds to the confusion. They wave him away, scribble something on his and my moms ticket, and eventually get escorted by a third agent to the precheck line. They don't know why someone walked them to the line, it wasn't to help my dad walk or anything.

Both parents put their things on the scanner, and an agent tells my dad to remove his kufi (he does) and gets a consult with another agent if my mother needs to remover her hijab (she doesn't, as they finally agree on, but later while patting her down, my mother says they nearly pulled it off several times.)  They go through the bags and bring out my fathers medication and tells him he needs prescriptions for it, he gives them the notes, they say they will hold it until after the pat down.   My father says thats ok, again reiterates he has a port and they cannot touch it.  He calls it a 'device' at one point which causes the agents to start speaking loudly at once, my father stands with his hands in the air while my mother tries to explain.  He tries to show it to them and they yell at him to 'not undress' (His first has a button front placket, he literally undid one button and pushed to the side, not 'undress' at all.) They take him into a small room away from my mother. He is roughly pated down 'like you would in a prison' (still unsure what exactly he means) but it took much longer than expected.  The agent starts pressing hard on his port and my father cries out. The agent begins to lecture him and say it's needed and they have to figure out what it is, at once point trying to pick up/pull at the port.

  My father has survived escaping genocide in our home country, survived bomb blasts that killed 80% his family, has buried his only son, and has never once in my lifetime cried in public.  I have literally never seen him cry, only my mother has, once. He couldn't stop himself from the tears, and he cried with pain.  

He tells the agent to stop, he is told to stop being 'aggressive' (again, he is a 5'7, 115 lb cancer patient who has never raised his voice or not cooperated) The agent keeps going, pressing hard on his legs, causing his knees to buckle and he falls to the floor.   The agent stops abruptly, they help him to his feet and offer a chair. My father is white, shaking, and still has tears.  They bring my mother into the room, she had already been roughly patted down herself but is fine.  They wait together for another 20-30 minutes, without any of their belongings or phones.  They agents finally come in and say they can go board their plane, and give a halfhearted apology for 'taking security seriously.'  They take their bags, which  are missing my fathers medication. He asks for it and after another 10-15 minutes or so, he gets it back. By this point the plane has left.  

He has now missed a very important scheduled cat scan and consult with his oncology team, and risks getting put out of the treatment plan, as well as possibly getting charged for not calling 24 hours ahead to reschedule, issues with the insurance, etc.  My father is in incredible, needless pain, and is at my sister's another night instead of back home where he has access to a nurse, hospital bed, etc.  My father is getting checked tomorrow morning by the hospital there to see about flying or getting his port flushed (as per his dr in Brooklyns advice when he called)

I would like to know what the best course of action to take to ensure my father can fly comfortably out of this airport and get to his appointments, for one, and secondly to ensure he does not lose his place in the study. If he is kicked out of the program, if we are charged for this appointment or cannot reschedule for a long time (which may not be worthwhile at this stage) can we sue the airline for the cost of that?  Can we request they pay for this checkup/stay in the local hospital tomorrow? They have already said the tickets are refunded when my mother called the airline but she has no checked their bank account yet. I am getting all of this second hand from my mother (and third hand from my sister) so I have tried to make a summary of all relevant details that I can go over with her later, so I'd love to know what relevant questions to ask as well.
My family is very quiet, I don't want to do anything to bring any more attention to us (like tweet at the airline) as that would be incredibly upsetting to my father.  I would if that is the only option, however.  I don't know if it's relevant that we are Muslim, either, I assume thats why they got so upset when he said it was a medical 'device.'  My father is an absolutely upstanding man who has done so much for the refugee community, other small business owners, and our neighborhood  and worked hard to rebuild and help others after 9/11.  He doesn't deserve to be treated like this, nobody does.  I would love some advice.

keepmeanon001,2019-09-28 12:12:33+00:00,I think my coworker's disabled son is stalking me. What options do I have? (OK)," I’m a high school teacher. I work in a very rural, very small school  and have been here for 15 years. “Dan,” my “across the hall mate” has  been here 8. His son,”Leo” has some serious development issues, and  attended the school until he graduated three years ago. Leo was somewhat  of a legend at the school. Since Dan was the football coach, Leo would  serve as a manager at the games and the kids treated him well. Leo would  often visit his dad’s classroom before and after school and I got to  know him as well. Leo became somewhat independent after graduation and  is able to hold down a very basic, part-time job that he can ride his  bike to from his home.

This past summer, Dan and his wife went on a three week vacation for  their anniversary. They asked me if I would be a source of support for  Leo while they were away. While Leo was okay to stay by himself, he  cannot drive, so I would take him to get groceries and drive him to work  if it was raining. I also checked in on him every day with a text or a  call. The last day I was to be in this role, Leo sent me a VERY  inappropriate text that included a photo of his penis. I told Leo that  was inappropriate and that I would be telling his father.

I showed Dan the text and he claimed that Leo’s phone must’ve been  “hacked” or “played with” while Leo was at work. I didn’t believe that  explanation, but I accepted it and moved on. The next day, my phone  started blowing up with texts from Leo (more than 100 inside 4 hours)  asking me if he could “hold on to me” and “take me for a ride on his 4  wheeler” and “kiss me gently.” I forwarded the texts to Dan and did not  response to Leo.

Dan came to my house the next day and said that Leo was not sending  those texts. He said he was going to take the phone and see what  happens. Then, I started getting texts through some “unknown number”  that were the same in tone and writing. A selfie of Leo nude was also  sent. I called Dan, thinking this might be something happening at Leo’s  job or something.

This didn’t stop. I was getting 100s of texts a day from different  numbers. As soon as I blocked one, another popped up. I went down to the  store where Leo worked and spoke with the manager. (I taught all of his  children). He told me that Leo had been spending a lot of time on a  coworker’s phone and he had already talked to Dan about it two weeks  ago! So, Dan knew this was happening and did nothing.

I changed my number, then school started and everyone was sent  contact information for all teachers. This included my new number. Dan,  being in my department and a member of the faculty, got this  information. The next thing I know, I’m getting crazy texts again. I  said something to Dan at work. Dan said Leo was “harmless” and I should  just respond to him because he liked me and the more I avoid him, the  more miserable it makes Leo. Dan even said those days that my number  stopped working Leo became very angry and Dan had to give him  medication.

Last night, when I got home from work, my kids told me that Leo had  come by looking for me. I was surprised that he had ridden his bike all  the way out here. The kids said he arrived in a car, but not Dan’s car.  My son guessed it was an Uber. I don’t want to sound like a paranoid  nut, but this whole thing is unsettling. 

Am I being stalked?  
Am I being unsympathetic to Leo’s problems?  
Is it wrong of me to expect Dan to manage his son’s problems?  
What do I do next? 

I’m not going anywhere, and I doubt Dan is, so we will be “across the hall mates” for another 10 years…

I took the post down because I got little helpful answers and mostly people telling me it wasn’t illegal or discrimination to make me work more hours with less choice because I don’t have children. I’m updating to let people know that I have spoken to my manager’s manager about it and it *IS* in fact workplace discrimination to alter hours based on not having children. Especially since I was explicitly told I wasn’t allowed to pick hours and always had to close because I did not have children to go home to, even though I was hired as an opener. My manager was given a written warning with notice she’d be put on probation if she continued the behavior, and my schedule was changed immediately so now I only close on three of my shifts in October, compared to all of them in September. They even had me work a mid shift today instead of closing! They said it was not my fault my manager had kids, nor was it my responsibility to pick up her slack. If she needed time to see to her children, she needed to request time off, not affect my work and personal life.

Delaware, USA. No homeowners association.

We live in a row home and the house attached to ours is vacant. It's been on the market since before we moved in, and nobody's lived in it for at least 7 years. There was a small cast iron fence between the two yards (on my property line) that went from under the fire escape to the brick garage (which you can see in the image). I removed that fence as it was on my property about a month ago and installed brand new, beautiful sod.

Well I come home today and this disgusting, mismatched random combination of fences has been erected between the yards. Part of it goes over my property line, crushing the sod, at the bottom of the fire escape. The leprechauns or whoever installed it stepped all over my grass to do so, and to top it all off, they gave us the ugly side, which is totally against fence etiquette.

I don't know who owns it, so I called the real estate agent. He was just as shocked as I was when I told him there had been a fence built at a house he is selling. He had no idea. He'll be in contact with the owner of the property tomorrow, but she is a 70 year old woman who doesn't live here, and he said he can't imagine why she would have a fence built. I asked my neighbor on the other side if she saw anything. She didn't.

ThrowawayStudee,2019-09-26 16:37:11+00:00,[UPDATE] My professor is offering extra credit to anyone who buys her MLM products. What can I do about this? [MA],"[Previous Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/d026a0/my_professor_is_offering_extra_credit_to_anyone/)

I didn't expect so my last post to blow up this much, and to also get flooded with hundreds of DMs to know what happened afterwards. I also didn't expect a bunch of random media organizations asking me for an interview over DMs. Apparently MLMs make for good news stories. (If you're a news or media organization, I don't want to share my story with you so you can stop asking)

So it turns out that I really didn't have to do anything, because some of the other students beat me to it. I sent the department head an email, but they told me that they were already dealing with it. When I went to the next class session, the professor wasn't there, but instead it was the department head and one of the deans for students. (This dean is a badass awesome dean by the way, all the students love this dean) They wanted to talk to us about ethical misconduct allegations in the class, and we spilled all the beans about the weird things she has been doing with the doTERRA stuff.

After we complained for like 20 minutes straight, the dean said ""I count about 5 reasons to fire this professor and each one is enough of a reason alone to fire her."" 

They thanked us and dismissed us from class and told us to keep an eye on our emails to know what will happen next. (We got to go early!)

As I was packing my things to leave, I overheard the dean talking to the head of the department. 

""So she offered to increase grades if her students purchased an unrelated product that put money back into her pocket, is breaking a couple of laws, including the exposure to chemicals that might cause serious problems with disability compliance, currently has the class average at an average of a D+ in the course (This I didn't know), broke the school's ethics rules, and is also using the college's printing studio meant for printing out readings for students to print out doTERRA pamphlets. (This I also didn't know)"" The Dean looked a little exasperated and in disbelief at this point, and wasn't really trying to keep this down I think.

Anyways, class was canceled for a week and then we got one of the senior professors to cover for the class. All the previous grades we got with the crazy professor was removed, and we've been doing just easy assignments and class is super easy now (I don't think they want to antagonize us any further). For the most part, it seems like they're just just giving us As for completion of the assignments, so this is looking like to be the easiest A I am ever going to get. 

I heard through the grapevine that the professor got fired, and also lost a teaching fellowship grant or something. One of my friends in the class told me that the doTERRA professor was fired in the department head's office, and stormed out of the office, but before she stormed out, she dumped hundreds of her doTERRA pamphlets from her bag onto the office's floor, along with a few testing samples of the oils, one of which shattered and spread peppermint oils all over the office. My friend apparently helped them clean up the mess since they came for office hours. I can confirm the office still smells like peppermint.

COmedicalthrowaway,2019-09-23 22:09:56+00:00,"Doctor didn't remove first IUD, put a second on top"," In early 2017, I visited my oBGYN in Washington, DC in order to have my 10 yr Paraguard IUD removed and replaced with a new Liletta IUD. I was talked into this after requesting to be steralized. I am not interested in having children and at the time, our insurance was not great and would not cover a vasectomy for my partner. 

The doctor talked me out of sterilization citing personal beliefs and instead recommended the IUD. She would remove the old one and she would place the new one. The procedure took place and I remember it was the most painful procedure I had ever had. I cried the whole way home because the pain made me forced to bend over, but they told me I would adjust and this was normal for the first few days. 

They took me to have an ultrasound to verify that they had placed the new device in my uterus correctly and removed the old one. They confirmed it had been placed correctly. Because the new Liletta IUD was a 3 year IUD, it needs to be removed before the 3 years are up so that I cannot become pregnant. During this period I relocated to Colorado in the Denver area. I recently scheduled to become sterilized this year in October and my new doctor agreed to remove the IUD while I was in surgery. A win-win because I am scared of the pain I'd had initially, though until now I didn't realize that wasn't normal. 

Two weeks ago I began experiencing pelvic pain, lower back pain, headaches, bleeding and cramping. The pain got gradually worse each day since that day. I couldn't have sex, I couldn't exercise and I could barely get from a sitting to standing position. The pain was unbearable - I nearly went to the ER but I didn't want to deal with the bills. I called to schedule an appointment and spoke to a nurse on September 5 days in and she recommended I take a pregnancy test. i took three and they were all negative. 

I went to my appointment last Friday and had an ultrasound. The nurse recommended she remove the IUD because she thought something might be wrong with it. It should not be causing pain. I agreed to the removal and she proceeded. During the procedure, the nurse was shocked (she actually exclaimed ""oh shit!"" when she pulled out the original Paraguard IUD that had never been removed by the previous doctor in addition to the second Liletta IUD that she placed on top of it. (There was a nurse in the room when the original doctor placed the new IUD on top of the old one so definitely a second opinion if needed. Neither caught it.)

When the nurse tried to remove the IUD last week, a piece of the original Paraguard IUD broke off and is now inside my uterus floating around. I had to have a second ultrasound to locate it. It is still in my body. The nurse recommended that they remove the IUD piece during surgery but that if it causes me pain in the meantime, I should go to the emergency room. 

I believe that the original doctor was negligent in her practice and either forgot to remove the original IUD or could not find it. She did not confirm that it was missing with imaging or scans so she placed a second one on top of it, putting me at risk. I am also being treated for an infection because during the procedure, both IUDs that had been removed showed signs of a uterine infection.

On a similar occasion last month he hit my son with the drone which left a long scar on his shoulder that also required stitches.

A few weeks ago I had my sliding glass door open as it was a beautiful day and then our neighbor just had to start flying the drone again, this time he flew it INTO OUR HOME! I grabbed my sons baseball bat and hit the drone to the floor and proceeded to destroy it. 

This lead to the neighbor throwing a fit and demanding to give him the drone back, I gave him everything except for the memory card which I currently have.

The memory card has the whole incident on tape as well as countless other occasions that I never even knew occurred, on tape it is proven that he has flown it up to my bedroom window countless times while I am at work and there are even videos of him following the neighbors with it.

moreorlessmore,2019-09-21 10:11:33+00:00,My landlord lied to me about my neighbour having a baby. Can I terminate the lease?,"I moved into my apartment on 1 September. When I came to check out the place initially, I could hear my upstairs neighbor's baby crying.

I think the landlord could sense my disinterest in the apartment after hearing it, and he assured me that the baby didn't live here - it was just family visiting temporarily. The units above me are 3 bedrooms, so I had no particular reason to doubt that it was just temporary visitors.

After almost a month of listening to the baby cry, I bumped into my neighbours and got chatting. Not only is it their baby and they live here, they've lived here for 5 years and own the apartment. My landlord also lives in the building, so he surely knows this.

I can't blame the baby for crying because babies are gonna do what they do. But I work from home, so I have to listen to it all day and it wakes me up multiple times in the night. I've gotten noise-canceling headphones, but I didn't really have budget for them so they're nowhere near top of the range ones that totally block out the high pitched crying of a baby. 

I also can't wear them while I sleep (I can't wear ear plugs or an eye mask or anything on my face/head while I sleep, I don't know why) so I wake up whenever the baby wakes up.

I'm starting to lose my mind a little bit. I can't get more than an hour or two of uninterrupted sleep, and when I'm woken I'm so irritated I can't fall asleep for hours again. This weekend, I'm staying at my parents an hour away just so I can get some sleep this weekend.

I'm financially able to move pretty much immediately, but I've signed a one year lease. How do I break it without forfeiting my deposit (which I'd need to pay the deposit on the new place)? I have nothing in writing showing the landlord lied, even though I've tried via email to coax him into admitting the situation in writing.

What can I do?

The board meeting was yesterday. When the floor was opened to owner commentary, I raised my hand and told them that we'd moved in about 6 months ago and what I liked about the community before telling them about the letter and what it said. I ended with, ""When I got this letter, it made me feel like Community isn't a welcoming place for young families."" 

It turns out that the letter was sent out without the full knowledge and consent of the board. In fact, they had no idea that it was sent out. The president of the board was livid that I and 6 other families that I know of received this letter and told us that our kids were allowed and encouraged to play on their scooters and bikes on the sidewalk. They don't want the kids to play in the parking lots for their safety. They also ask that kids stay out of plantings and off the grass. Then she referred us to the playground that has several safety concerns and mentions the new layers of wood-chips that had been put down at the beginning of summer. 

I told her that while we appreciate the new layer of wood-chips I still had some safety concerns. 

* The end of the slide is about two feet off the ground and when my three year old goes down she shoots off the end like a cannon.

*The nylon covering on the climbing structure has come off and I'm worried my kids fingers could get hurt. 

*There's a strange lurid green fungus the size of a hockey puck by the swings. When you poke it it lets off spores and oozes. 

They'll have a contractor come out to give an estimate to fix the playground. 

The person that sent the letter was counting on us to be intimidated by official stationary, not to talk to each other, and discouraged by the inconvenient board meetings. I'm especially upset that six or seven families that I know of received this letter and four of them were renters/people of color. One person is a single man whose nephew visited him for a weekend and brought his bike. I plan on joining the board once I've been here a bit longer and implementing community-building events so that people don't feel so alone.

The train doors were already closed for departure and we were unable to alert Amtrak staff. There were no emergency phones or emergency stop buttons available in the car. A fellow passenger and I were so desperate to notify Amtrak employees and prevent the train from departing that we attempted to remove an emergency window.  Between the two of us passengers, we were not able to remove the window. My husband and I were visiting from Japan so we do not have phones on a US network to dial 911 so we had to wait for a passenger to do so. The emergency responders did not arrive until 20-30 min after the event began - even though Amtrak Police officers were only 30 seconds away in the station the train was still sitting at.  So basically once the train closed the doors, there was no way to notify Amtrak of the emergency.

homelesscheeto,2019-09-15 08:05:09+00:00,Can I file for a restraining order for an ex-girlfriend that hasn’t left me alone for almost five years (since we broke up),"Hey!
Just a bit of backstory, I dumped this girl in ninth grade after she committed credit card theft (Just her parents’ card, but spent almost $1000). Obviously if she’d steal from her parents, she’d steal from her boyfriend. She’s never let it go. No other boyfriends, and got into crazy amounts of trouble at school afterwards. In senior year, she was busted for sending nudes of herself to minors, from fellow seniors (Myself, 17 at the time, included) all the way down to seventh graders. (She was 19 at the time) School covered it up, even with copious amounts of proof. She was let off without even a suspension. Nonetheless, she’s never stopped contacting me. Every two months or so, she’ll try to text me with a new number or social media account or email. I block them constantly, but it’s like cutting the head off of a hydra. Two more replace it. She’s constantly belittled me, made fun of my mother’s death, lied to girlfriends I had, saying we slept together and such, and basically done everything she can to ruin anything that makes me happy, and I’m tired of it. She emailed my college email account the other day, as we both go to the same community college, and I wrote up this reply, but before I sent it, I wanted to know if there is anything I should/ shouldn’t say.

Julia,

Listen, I’m going to be completely honest with you. I don’t know why you keep trying to contact me. At the risk of coming off rude, Julia, I literally want nothing to do with you. I don’t want to talk to you. I don’t want to see you. I just don’t want you to be part of my life. I’m sorry if that hurts your feelings, but we broke up in ninth grade. We’re done. Permanently. Please, for the love of god, find a new hobby. I’ve given you chances on top of chances and every time I try and reconcile with you, you fuck me over, and I’m really tired of it. Your opinion of me is the last thing I care about, so call me whatever you want, but I’m tired of you fucking up anything that makes me happy because you get some sick form of pleasure from it. Please don’t contact me, my family, or my friends again. If you do, and I’m being 100% honest here, I will file for a restraining order. You’re coming dangerously close to stalker territory, and I’m done. So, politely, fuck off.

Regards,
u/homelesscheeto

So, I guess my final question, are these acceptable grounds to file a restraining order? Or does she physically need to be stalking me or whatever. Any advice would be appreciated!

Today, I received a lovely notice in my email informing me the lead author (who my professor is claiming to be) of my research has published it and I no longer have any rights to my own research or code. This professor in no way shape or form helped with this research or code. I did it all on my own outside of class and submitted it at the end of the semester, never once receiving his assistance on it. He has slapped his name and email above mine on the paper and signed a contract removing my rights to my own work. 

I take specific issue with the following points of the contract:

1. The undersigned represents that he/she has the power and authority to make and execute this form.

- What gives him the “power and authority to make and execute this form?” I did not consent to this publication, I wasn’t even aware of it until I was informed today I have no rights to my own work anymore. 

5. For jointly authored Works, all joint authors should sign, or one of the authors should sign as authorized agent for the
others.

-I did not authorize him to sign for me in any shape or form, and he is not an author, he gave no advice, no help,  what so ever, he did not even understand what my code did. How can he claim to be an author? Because he slapped an A on it?

1. ln the event the author makes a presentation based upon the Work at a conference hosted or sponsored in whole or in part by the *publishing company name removed*, the author, in consideration for his/her participation in the conference, hereby grants the  *publishing company name removed* the unlimited, worldwide, irrevocable permission to use, distribute, publish, license, exhibit, record, digitize, broadcast, reproduce and archive, in any format or medium, whether now known or hereafter developed.

-Again, definitely not an author 

2. In connection with the permission granted in Section 1, the author hereby grants *publishing company name removed* the unlimited, worldwide, irrevocable right to use his/her name, picture, likeness, voice and biographical information as part of the advertisement, distribution and sale of products incorporating the Work or Presentation, and releases *publishing company name removed* from any claim based on right of privacy or publicity.”


-I take SERIOUS issue with someone signing to the fact that some corporation can have the “the unlimited, worldwide, irrevocable right to use his/her name, picture, likeness, voice and biographical information as part of the advertisement, distribution and sale of products incorporating the Work or Presentation” for me without my consent. 

Correct me if I am wrong, but this just seems like straight up plagiarism to me. How can someone just sign away your rights to not only your own work but also your own privacy? Seriously, we did not go to this guy once for advice, help, or anything. 

On top of all this madness, the contract which I’m somehow now obliged to gave away my right to store any work related to on any sort of public platform. As a strong advocate of open source software all of my code for that project is on my pubic github and now I will be in breach of copy right for keeping it there, which I’m absolutely in no way shape or form even remotely okay with. This seems insane to me. I could have been removed from school for slapping my name on someone else’s hard work. 

Do I have any recourse here? Do I contact the company? The university? Am I just screwed? I would feel really horrible getting someone in enough trouble to make them loose their job, but I also don’t want my rights just completely destroyed without not only my consent but even more so without me even knowing this was happening.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/d3gngd/my_professor_took_my_research_slapped_his_name_on/,legaladvice,6487,142,0.0
wrongfulgrandlarc,2019-09-12 15:13:09+00:00,[UPDATE] My room mate is accusing me of grand larceny. I’ve been forced out of my home and my belongings are currently being thrown out of the window and onto the street. NYC.,"First and foremost, I just want to say thank you for the support and the advice given to me. I did not expect such a huge amount of outreach. 

When I posted yesterday, it was just a jumble of words that I put together without putting in much thought because well I just got a phone call telling me all my things were being thrown out the window and I pretty much panicked.  

For some context, I’ve been living in the same apartment complex for about four years. I’m very well acquainted with the neighbors, security, superintendent and so on. So while I was away on vacation, when the accusation happened my room mate went around the complex to anyone who would listen that I stole $3700, I’m wanted for arrest and there’s a restraining order refraining me from even coming onto the premises. This is how I was able to get the information through word of mouth. 

So from all the advice that I was given.. I decided to check on this RO and couldn’t find it at all in the system. Turns out my room mate merely just filed a police report and none of the things I was hearing was true. 

So I got to my apartment complex and a lot of my things were in garbage bags and was thrown out of the window. My things were everywhere. So I called the police. I let them know the situation and they came into the apartment with me along with my landlord.

My room was indeed broken into and trashed. Many of my valuables such as my laptop, some sentimental jewelry that was given to me, shoes, etc were all missing. I was devastated. I filed a police report with the officers and stated everything that was missing and took a lot of pictures and videos like many of you stated.

During all this my room mate was there and it also looked as if other people started living there too. Turns out my room mate is using this situation to now squat on the property, not pay rent and also brought other people and friends to live there as well? Unfortunately because of this, there was no arrests even though all my valuables were missing and half my things were scattered across the street. The police said that because there is so many people coming in and out of my apartment and no witnesses they were not able to arrest anyone. I was advised that this was a matter of civil (I think) court and I would have to settle this there. They also advised me that I could stay here BUT they believe that it wasn’t in my best interest or my safety to stay since he seemed violent and will be squatting on the property anyway which can take months to evict. So they escorted me into my room to collect whatever else I had left and I am now still staying with my friend. 

As for my lease, my landlord is understanding and feels sorry for everything’s that happened. We’re mutually agreeing to end the lease without any problems. 

I don’t really have a place to call home now and I pretty much have to start over since I was only able to grab clothes. Even if I did end up grabbing all my things, I wouldn’t have anywhere to put it. In hindsight, I feel foolish for being tricked. I guess this is a do over but thanks to all of you, at least I know the next steps to take and have some understanding of what to do and I find comfort in that.

rubbishtrashg,2019-09-12 11:20:10+00:00,The defendant lied at small claims yesterday-and now I can prove it. What steps should I take? (Missouri),"I’m in a dispute with my previous landlord. We negotiated terms that I could terminate the lease early if I found a new tenant for the apartment. (To sign their own lease). I did in December 2018. She never returned my security deposit or other monies owed-so I filed for small claims and subpoenaed her to bring copies of all rental agreements from 2018 to present. 


Yesterday was our day in court. I told my side, and she claims that the tenant I found for her signed a lease but didn’t pass the background check. (?!) The judge asks “do you make it a habit of running a background check before signing leases?” and she says “not typically, but u/trashrubbishg was harassing me so much I just wanted to get it over with”. 

Judge: “Did you notify u/trashrubbishg that things didn’t work out?

Ll: “yes”

Judge:”How?”

Ll: “... text message... I think”


Here’s the thing. I was never notified, and that’s a bold faced lie. She claims the apartment was empty until May of this year. However, the utilities were transferred to the new tenant in December (when the tenant I found signed a lease). Today I plan on calling the utility company for monthly averages to prove someone was in the apartment.


The judge didn’t make a decision in court yesterday. He said he’d need a few days to review the statute and he’d send us his verdict by mail next week. Is it too late to submit evidence proving that my old landlord was lying?",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/d36erq/the_defendant_lied_at_small_claims_yesterdayand/,legaladvice,2772,81,0.0

I’ve been forced out of my home and my belongings are currently being thrown out of the window and onto the street.,"NYC. I’m sorry if the text is one big block, I’m on mobile. I don’t really know what to say, I’m baffled. I’ve been living with a new room mate for about 3 months. Two weeks ago, my room mate accused me of stealing 3700$ out of his bedroom and swears up and down that it was me because he has “footage”. He also filed a restraining order. According to the police report, this theft occurred between the hours of 4 am to 5 am of August 22, 2019. However, during this time I was about an hour away from home and have receipts to prove it. I went to a 24 hour CVS and a bank that places me somewhere else. Not only that but I was at the airport at 6 am going on vacation. This was not me. I didn’t get word of what was going on until 3 days into my vacation and was told I was wanted for grand larceny and fleeing the country. As soon as I came back to New York on the 28th, I called the detective and set up a meeting. When I did meet with him, I showed him the receipts and provided him with my license plate to prove that I was not in the neighborhood the day of. He very much nonchalantly brushed me off and let me know he’ll “get around” to my case because he has more important cases to take care of. However this is literally ruining my life. I have not been home since coming back and I’ve been staying with a friend. My room mate is literally squatting in the apartment and ransacking my room. I got a call this morning that he broke into my room and is currently throwing all my possessions out of the 2nd story window. I’m a student and can’t afford a lawyer right now. I’m about to head to my apartment and I don’t know what to expect. I don’t know what to do.

My mother is 70 years old, 4'11"", english isn't her first language, was going through airport security. She agreed to be screen by security (but again, English is not her first language, nor was she aware of how invasive TSA ""pat-downs"" can be). A heavy-set lady twice her size came over and started the pat-down. My mother felt her breasts being aggressively compressed, felt violated, and instinctively swatted away at the agent's arms. Someone called the police over, and my mother complained about security. The cop gave her a case number, name of the manager, and waved her on her way past security.

Two weeks go by and she receives a letter claiming that an investigation was opened, she assaulted a TSA agent, faces up to $14K in penalties, and has 20 days to respond to their letter. 

I don't think anyone was deliberately belligerent here. I think the agent was trying to do her job, but my mother did not understand how disgusting one of those ""pat-downs"" would feel. My mother is a victim of attempted robbery and rape, and is very defensive when it comes to surprise physical contact. She said the airport was loud, english her second language, she did not recall details on how the pat-down would press so hardly on her breasts, and when the agent, who was twice her size, half her age, suddenly pressed down on her boobs with considerable strength, she instantly reacted, quickly shoving back agent's arms in what she considers self-defense, demanded to speak to agent's supervisor.

ithomas510,2019-09-07 00:43:40+00:00,My assets were almost split in a divorce that I was not a party of.,"TL/DR I own my own farm. My parents were in the middle of a very messy divorce. My mothers lawyer motioned to include my assets in my farm into their divorce. My step-father settled before it could get worse and the motion approved.

&amp;#x200B;

I own my own farm in a family farm abundant state. I am 25 and have a family of my own. I own 100% of the assets and memberships of my farm, besides renting very expensive machinery from him to farm my stuff, as I am new at it. My mother's attorney attempted to subpoena me, my insurance, my bank, as well as my other employer, who I work for to keep insurance on my wife and kids, and farming is very volatile right now. I of course objected to everything as quickly and efficiently as possible. Eventually, he subpoenaed me for a deposition, which did not go as well as I liked, because I did not want the invasion of privacy on my business like that. His farm expert was my mother who does not know anything about farming, and reacted as if my confusion to the questions were as if I was not farming, but as if my dad was farming for me. My stepfather could not farm a majority of his stuff as this same attorney encumbered him and he could not get a loan. I qualified for a government loan as a first time farmer and rented some land, equipment, and storage. I also found landlords that my stepfather was no part of whatsoever, in the sense that he never rented from them before. I also picked up my own land later in the year. 

&amp;#x200B;

After the deposition, my mother's attorney motioned to ""INCLUDE ASSETS OF ITHOMAS510 FARM IN MARITAL ESTATE.""

My mother's attorney continued to call my farm names such as ""alter ego"" and ""alleged operation"" in public court documents.

A week later my stepfather settled the case because of this and other things.  As I was not a party I could not submit anything whatsoever to defend myself or my business. I was completely defenseless and at the will of the judge and this attorney deciding what my family and my farm's future was going to be like. They attempted to include it into the marital estate with absolutely no financials, no proof of membership, no proof of anything really.  


Do I have any sort of a case here? Legal Malpractice? Defamation? Slander of title? Heck, even emotional damages.

Sickofthisshit2019,2019-09-05 09:16:28+00:00,"[UPDATE] Husband knocked a drone out of the sky for peeping in our windows, what should we do next?","I wanted to post an update to my [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/czq6fa/husband_knocked_a_drone_out_of_the_sky_for/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share). TLDR at bottom.  

First, I want to thank those who commented with advice on my original post. I wasn't expecting much support and kind of hastily posted in a panic after the incident, but I'm so glad I did.  

My husband had trapped the drone underneath a large bucket, where it buzzed and banged around the sides for a couple hours, before it eventually went silent. We waited awhile before deciding how we should proceed. Nobody ever came to retrieve it (and we were watching for anyone peeking over the fence, etc.) After it went quiet, we used gloves and inspected the drone, took some photos of it, and found that the camera mounted on the drone had a memory card inside it. I know I should have left it for police, but I couldn't ignore it.  

I put it in our computer and saw the files and dates-- it had footage from the past 4 days, with date and time stamps on the files.  

We could see in the videos where the drone was flying from; it was a neighbor about half a block away. I recognized the yard immediately because it's the only house on the block with a mother-in-laws cottage on the property (in addition to a house and garage.)  

I already knew about the afternoon visits. The drone would take off, go around the block, and approach from the opposite side, and look in my daughters window. It was cool on Sunday &amp; Monday so the windows were closed and shades were drawn, and the drone looked at the window, saw it was closed, flew around to the other windows, then went back to the same yard (again flying way out of its way to go back).  

**The owner was on video picking up his drone at the end of these flights. You could see his whole body and face.**  

What I didn't know was that the drone was also coming back at night. Every night this week, around 1-3 AM. Same flight pattern and straight to my daughters windows. It was hot on Tuesday, so the 2nd floor windows were open with fans to circulate the air. My husband and I have had the girls sleeping downstairs with us because of how unsettled we were, so they weren't in their rooms, but it spent a good 20 minutes or so zooming in and looking around the girls rooms. It did look into one of my sons rooms briefly, and this wave of horror washed over me when I saw my 3 year old son asleep in his bed, through the eyes of this drone. Actually seeing one of my kids on video clear as day really, really disturbed us. As soon as he saw it, my husband was irate. He wanted to go bang on the guy's door right then and confront him. I honestly thought about letting him, but quickly realized that was a terrible idea. We talked about it and decided the best option would be to gather a really solid amount of evidence and hand it over to police, so that's what we did. 

I was able to look up the tax bill for the property, and get the name of the owner. I searched the owners name in our public court records access website, and found a conviction for 1st degree sexual assault of a child from the 90s. I then searched his name in our state sex offender registry, and found him and his picture (he is a lifetime registrant, so has to stay current on photos and address info). It was the same guy in the drone video. This is literally my worst nightmare. 

I made digital and hard copies of all this for police, including a frame from the drone video showing the guys face next to his registry photo. I spent the next several hours meticulously going through our video footage, previous incident dates/times, organizing in chronological order, cataloging all of the evidence we had gathered previous police report dates, report numbers, anything and everything I could think of, and made several copies of it. At this point, we don't't really care what the consequences were for knocking a drone down, so long as this guy was caught. I was determined to deliver this to the police with a bow on top to ensure something would be done.  

I had my dad come over to watch the kids after they were asleep, and my husband and I took the drone, the memory card, and all our digital and hard copy evidence down to the Police department. We spoke with several different officers and explained exactly what had happened and showed them the evidence we had. **They took it seriously this time.** They had us give a detailed written statement, and repeatedly went over it with us before having us sign it.  

They couldn't tell us exactly what their next steps would be, but they did say they were definitely going to get in contact with the individual and would not stop until they had. They said he could and likely would face charges, and surprisingly, they never even pressed us about my husband whacking it down. I asked about tracing the identifying numbers on it and they said they'd see what they could do, but had to consult with another department first. I asked if they would take fingerprints and they said they could if they needed to, but not at this time. They just kinda made it sound like they were gonna go talk to this guy and try to get him to admit it based on the evidence they have? I don't know but I definitely get the sense that they're FINALLY gonna go after this guy hard. Even though we are furious and horrified, I at least feel better knowing who it was, and that police are going after him.  

I will be waiting for an update from police in the next few days. Hopefully I'll have good news to update soon. Thank you again for your help and advice!  

**TLDR: The drone had a camera with a memory card inside. The card showed us where it was coming from--the home of an actual registered child sex offender. We gathered all of our evidence and went to police. Police are taking it seriously this time and it sounds like they are not going to stop until they get him.**",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/czydld/update_husband_knocked_a_drone_out_of_the_sky_for/,legaladvice,1121,3,0.0

He attends a private school and there has been a bullying Snapchat campaign against him in which I was sent screenshots. We are in MS and I’m not sure how to handle this.,"As my posts said, my son was strangled today in the weight room. No staff has answered calls, and I was not notified of this. When I picked my child up from the bus stop the marks were highly visible. 

He refused to tell me what happened for hours. After talking to a couple of parents of classmates and him as well, I was given a pretty good run down. One player turned the lights out, and a 9th grader- we will call Wyatt proceeded to use a fabric ribbon to strangle my child from the back. 

To say that I am livid is an understatement. I pay a hefty tuition for my child to attend this school and am baffled he could be assaulted and have highly visible ligature marks on his neck and no teacher or coach asked any questions or investigated. 

After the incident and we arrived home, a friend forwarded me a Snapchat thread with several screenshots of my child being cyber bullied, as well as threats of it happening again if he doesn’t “sit his ass down”. The snap chat was from the QB of the JR High game, and I find this highly inappropriate.

I tried contacting school admin, with no luck. I did reach out to the cyber bullying kid’s father and was responded to with racist ad hominem attacks- being told that I don’t need to start nothing and “y’all” people (I’m white) aren’t gonna “play with him or his sons sports”. After the childish responses and racist bologna, I believe I’ve decided to try to take this to the police. I’m not really sure how to go about this. Cyber bullying and assault are just not acceptable.

Sickofthisshit2019,2019-09-04 20:20:08+00:00,"Husband knocked a drone out of the sky for peeping in our windows, what should we do next?","Over the summer, there has been a drone flying around and lingering over our property, with a camera attached. We figured it was due to some construction in the area, or some kind of surveying. At first, it would stay well above our property so we weren't really concerned, but then it started flying lower and more frequently over our home and property.  We have 8 security cameras and we started taking pictures of it as well. It's hard to tell how close it is in the photos, but the security cameras have captured quite a bit of footage of it in relation to our house--in our backyard, next to our home, etc. It's going over our 6 foot privacy fence and directly into our backyard while we're outside, and here's the part that concerns me most-it was hovering outside of our windows.  We have 6 children, all with bedrooms on the 2nd story, and the drone would hover outside our 4 and 2 year old daughters rooms, in particular.  In summer with the windows open (with screens), there were several occasions where our daughters would scream and cry and call to us, telling us there was a robot or blinking lights outside their window, and that it ""sounded like bees"".  Obviously, it was the drone paying them visits. We hung blackout shades and curtains, but since we don't have central air in our older home, sometimes on hot days, we had no choice but to leave the windows open with fans in them, and the drone would pay them a visit. These window peeping incidents happened **16 times**! I kept records and gathered evidence and documentation of each incident (security camera footage, dates, times, what happened, etc.)  

I've called police several times and made reports and handed over flash drives full of our evidence, but they told us there are no specific ordinances about drones in our municipality, and they seem generally disinterested in investigating this. For some reason, they're pretty flippant about it and seem to think it's just a teenager messing with us, which is maddening to me! There are 66 convicted sex offenders within a 1 mile radius of our home alone. I can't even get them to return our calls when I call the officers who took our reports.  (We are about 15 miles from an airport, so I don't think we're in a no fly zone)   

I know you're not allowed to damage other peoples property, and doing so can break some federal laws when it comes to drones. I also know these drones are supposed to be registered or licensed in some way.  After months of this and no action from law enforcement, my daughters screaming and crying, and the unsettling feeling of being creeped on, my husband decided to take matters into his own hands.  The drone has been coming around 3:00PM most days since school began, which is when we get home with our kids after school. He waited along the fence line near our daughters bedroom with a big fishing net for it to come, and sure enough, it did. He was able to whack it down to the ground and put a large bucket over it.   

What do we do now? I want to call the police so they can trace the serial number or whatever registration it has, but after looking at some other posts about it, I'm afraid my husband may get himself into legal trouble if we do. This just happened, and no one has shown up to retrieve it yet. Should we call police? Should we take it to the police station? Should we call a lawyer instead?   Smash it to pieces? (I'm joking...kind of)  

How should we proceed with this? Is there any way my husband can not get into legal trouble for this *and* have the person whose responsible for harassing our family found? Could there be criminal charges for either or both parties?

Leostin,2019-09-04 13:27:54+00:00,[CA] I smashed a drone in my yard this morning. What can happen to me?,"Obligatory on mobile, etc. 

This morning, as per usual, I got up at 5, got ready, and left at around 5:15. Ten minutes later, my wife calls me saying there's a drone hovering in our backyard and it's making her feel unsafe and violated, as if she's being watched. We have two dogs, but otherwise she was home alone early in the morning and scared. 

I drove back home and found it hovering about a foot off the ground in the middle of my yard, with a camera attached and I assume on. I walked outside with a baseball bat and tried to gesture to the camera for it to leave, and even brandished the bat a couple of times. After it still hasn't moved, I hit it with the bat, which broke the blades off a couple of motors and knocked the battery off. 

I brought it inside and left for work, and my wife was very grateful and felt much better after I left. 

I personally felt that the only reason someone would be flying a drone that close to the ground at that time of morning was to either harass my dogs, or to scope out my home for burglary, so I felt I made a safe and conscious decision to protect my family and pups. 

But now I'm curious about the liability and my research tells me there's a lot of debate about whether it's legal for someone to be on your property that low with a UAV or whether I legally had the right to destroy it. 

Can I be held liable for the damage? If the owners come to my door can I just give them the drone back and tell them to keep it off my property, or will be be expected to pay for the cost of a replacement? Do I have any defense for protecting my home and dogs from invasive cameras and a nuisance danger for my dogs?

rabidstoat,2019-09-03 12:39:32+00:00,"[GA] 92-year-old granddad with Alzheimer's has withdrawn $1600 last month during ATM visits with his home care aide, and much of the money is unaccounted for. Illegal or immoral?","I suspect this will end up immoral and not illegal but wanted to ask.

My 92-year-old granddad has the early stages of Alzheimer's. He lives with my mom and has a home care aide come by three times a week, for 6 hours a visit, so my mom can work part-time and grocery shop and stuff.

During her visits she helps him with eating and hygiene and stuff, but will also take him out to get a haircut or eat lunch or things like that. Well, my aunt was reviewing his bank account for August and he took out much more money from ATMs than normal -- $1600 over 8 visits. Seven of these visits were with the home health aide.

Nobody can figure out where the money went. They ask him, but he has early stage Alzheimer's and questions can be confusing. But as one example, the last time visit where they did notice money missing he went out to Subway for lunch with the health care aide. He withdrew $200 and came back with $140. It does not cost $60 to eat at Subway, and he can't really explain where the other $50 or so went.

In the past there have been issues with my granddad giving money to ""help"" his in-home aide workers, which I bet could be what's happening here. They'll give him a sob story about bills or no food or no gas money, and he'll give them money to help. He lost a few thousand bucks this way before, being nice. The alternative, I guess, is that she is helping him with his money and just keeping some of it. Or he could be just losing it, but losing it eight times is a lot. Anyway, it's hard with his Alzheimer's to really track down what's happening.

I told my parents to not use this aide worker anymore and tell the agency that placed her what's going on with this. **Is there really anything else that they can do?** I'm guessing this is not illegal because he has control over his own money, and it's likely he just was giving money to her to be nice. Either way it's hard to say.

**tl;dr:** Granddad with Alzheimer's withdrew $1600 while out on trips with his health aide worker and over $1000 of that money is unaccounted for, and because of the Alzheimer's he can't really explain what happened to it. Aside from hiring the aide worker and telling her agency, and putting in steps to prevent this from happening again, is there anything to do? Anyone else to report this to?",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/cz4bpb/ga_92yearold_granddad_with_alzheimers_has/,legaladvice,1672,58,0.0

robbzilla,2019-09-02 16:06:58+00:00,Tx: Pregnant Wife was in a wreck and lost her baby," As I stated we're in Texas (Dallas area) and have suffered a tragedy. We recently went through an IVF transfer. My wife works nights at a hospital and was traveling to work when a car took a left in front of her from oncoming traffic. My wife hit the car, totaling her vehicle and injuring herself. She was taken to a local hospital. She was discharged a few hours later, and the blood test indicated that she was in fact, pregnant.

Two days later, we went in to the reproductive facility and they confirmed that we had lost the baby.

One other thing: the police report states that the investigator's opinion is that my wife's statements were accurate, and we also have a witness who hung around and gave a statement upholding my wife's side of the story.

Our car is totaled, which is being handled by insurance. The real loss is the baby, though. My wife is devastated, and the remaining fertilized eggs we have aren't as good a quality. Here's what I think we should do, and I'm wondering if anyone has solid advice for us based on local law.

1&gt; We may want to talk to the police about criminal proceedings. The woman driving the car didn't have a license and had a minor in the car with her. She got a citation for no operator license.  
2&gt; Talk to a personal injury lawyer. Mostly to try and get compensation to pay for another round of IVF. That's expensive and our insurance has a lifetime max, which is pretty much exhausted in one cycle.  
3&gt; Pay for therapy for my wife. We have some coverage through insurance, but she's an emotional wreck, and I don't have the experience to help her through this by myself.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/cyqxts/tx_pregnant_wife_was_in_a_wreck_and_lost_her_baby/,legaladvice,1068,86,0.0

LVTVTS,2019-09-01 19:45:36+00:00,Neighbor threatening to sue us for cutting down our own tree.,"Ohio

This January we had a giant oak tree cut down in our backyard. Prior to this happening we informed our neighbors as we had to have lots of trucks and a crane blocking the street and my driveway for short periods of time during the day they cut it down. No one said anything or seemed to really care. 

The tree was a huge hazard. All winter we had been experiencing small limbs falling and we were starting to get concerned for one falling onto our house. We did have the tree trimmed every other year. But one big limbs finally fell on our patio after an ice storm, crushing our furniture and patio awning. As soon as the weather allowed - we had the entire tree cut down. We discovered that the tree was actually very unhealthy. Most of the inside was decayed and there was a giant crack down the center of the base. Seriously a ticking time bomb. This definitely saved our house as well as our neighbors homes. 

Fast forward to the summertime, as our yards are coming into bloom and the heat is rising our AC bills. We did notice our electric bill was a little higher as we no longer have the usual shade of the tree. A small price to pay for our safety. 

Our next door neighbors have essentially a botanical garden in their backyard. They are retired and spend a lot of time working on their yard and landscaping. The tree branches had previously reached over a bit of their property, but more significantly provided a lot of shade over the house and yard. 

Apparently - now that their yard has gone from partial sun to full sun, a large amount of their flowers and shrubs were unable to thrive as usual. Their electric bill is also effected. 

Mr approached us a few times over the summer to tell us how selfish and rude we were to not consider how this would effect their yard now that there is significantly more sun. Their house is also featured on our townships garden club annual tour and they decided they could not participate this year due to the “significant losses.”

Another neighbor (a much more reasonable one) said that he had approached them and asked if they would be interested in “teaming up” to sue for costs of lost landscaping and electric bills due to us cutting down the tree. He said no and then told us - just in case they decide to actually sue us. 

I realize this sounds completely insane. I can guarantee that the entire base and roots of the tree were on our property (no question - it was smack in the center of our yard). All that touched their property was the afternoon shade the tree provided and a few feet of branches.

We did inform them of this happening right at the beginning - I don’t believe this is our fault that we prefer to spare our house and lives over their landscaping. In fact we probably spared their own home by cutting this tree down - if it fell in their direction it would have definitely hit their house too.

My step mom says there is no money left and what was left by my dad was used to send my step-siblings to university and pay for the family's expenses. Can someone help me please?,"I am really sorry if this is long but i have no idea where to turn to get help. I am also sorry if screw up terms. I am a minor, and i am about to start my last year of high school. I am currently living in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. 

My mom passed away when i was 2 and we lived in Vancouver at the time. My dad remarried when i was 8 and i ended up becoming the youngest kid in the family. My step mom has always been mentally unstable and hates me in general. 

My dad passed away \~6 years ago from cancer. Before my dad passed away he told me that there was a trust setup for me with a fair amount of money to pay for my university from his first wife. He also told me that his will was setup to ensure that i wouldn't need to worry about anything for university or need to worry about money. He told me over and over that i would be taken care of no matter what.

Earlier this month my step mom made a comment vaguely asking how i expected to pay for college/university on minimum wage. I told her what my dad told me, and she said that everything my dad had left was spent to take care of the family, and to send my older step siblings to university (she said it was ""first come, first serve""). She also has absolutely refused to help me in anyway as it is ""waste of her time"". I have ripped apart the house trying to find any sort of paperwork from my mom/dads estate but i cannot find anything.

I have tried to talk 2 lawyers who specializes in estates and wills, the first one told me he could not do a consult with a minor unless my guardian is present (no chance). The other one basically wanted a lot of money to even do anything which i don't have.

I have also tried to reach out to my estranged part of my moms family, her sister was able to dig up something with the name of the company who took care of her estate, but that company no longer seems to exist. My dad on the other hand was an only child, and as long as i remember i don't remember anyone else from his family, nor can i find anything. 

I don't really know where to look or what to do at this point anymore. 

TLDR; I am supposed to have money in a trust/will from both of my parents. My step mom says this is not true and all the money left by my dad was used to take care of the family and pay for my step siblings tuition.

I showed up today to do final cleaning and pick up my items and the unit was remodeled and the new tenants things were stored in the closets. My things were gone. What is my recourse?

I have overlapping leases, one of them ends Aug 31st. I moved out of that unit last week of July. I was in contact with the new tenant moving in Sept 1st and he was unwilling to pay to move in early so I told him as a courtesy he could move in Aug 31 free of charge. I then left some cleaning supplies and an AC unit at my old unit, just using it as storage as I lived at my new place. I let my landlord know I was planning on moving out early and that I'd let them know when they could do a walk-through to assess the unit, and they said ""okay, let us know."" That was the last communication I had with them.

I went to my old unit today to retrieve my things and they were all gone and the unit was remodeled. The new tenant had also stored his belongings in my closet. I paid full rent for August and they did all of this without my consent or notifying me at all. They kept the AC unit and have offered to deliver it to my new address but all my cleaning supplies ($50) are gone.

I talked with the landlord and she claims the new tenant called once a day claiming I said they could move in early and the landlord eventually caved and let them. What is my recourse here?

joecooool418,2019-08-24 15:43:28+00:00,My elderly neighbors have developed debilitating dementia and I don't know if I should contact their family or the state to help out (FL) (IL),"My neighbors are deep into their 80's and we have been great friends for more than a decade. They are very, very wealthy and have multiple homes. I'll Call them EMB

Over the last few years they cut contact with their son, then their grand kids, then their siblings all because (I'm told) they wanted access to their wealth.

Their circle has gotten smaller and smaller to the point that they no longer have blood relatives that want anything to do with them.

And dementia has become a problem. For the past few years they could tell you what happened in the 1940's like it happened yesterday but couldn't remember what they had for lunch. Now both of them are well along with the disease and paranoia has set in.

Their summer home is in IL and I have always kept an eye on their property in FL when they leave. I keep my boat parked at their dock and walk the property several times a week. Up until they left a few months ago, I had a set of keys. But they took them this time when they left and also installed security cameras (I have no idea who looks at the cameras, they certainly lack the technical ability to do so). They still wanted me to keep my boat there and look after the place.

Until June everything was fine. They went on their 60th wedding anniversary trip and we had a great chat when they returned. Then nothing. Radio silence. I use to call them two or three times a week and emailed him photos of his property when something was up. I haven't had a response now in two months.

But they are talking to several of my neighbors. They are calling them at all hours of the night asking them to go check on their home because someone is breaking in. My neighbors then call me because I look after the place and when I go to inspect, no one is breaking in. EMB have called at least four of my other neighbors since June but not me.

Finally one of my neighbors told me that EMB said I was ""a traitor"" and was talking to their son and letting people into their FL house. I only ever spoke to their son once and that was at least five years ago and I've had no communication since. I also don't have keys to their home anymore so obviously I'm not letting anyone in.

One of my other neighbors told me that EMB said someone had taken $500K from one of their accounts at their bank here in FL.

I moved my boat after I was told that because its clear to me that they think I'm out to hurt them.

Last week I wrote them a letter saying that I knew they thought I was talking to their family but that was not true. That I didn't have keys to their house and if someone really was trying to get to their money they needed to call the FBI. I let them know that I still cared about them and they could call me if they want. But I've not heard from them.

So yesterday another neighbor calls me to let me know that EMB had called the police to investigate another break in and the police had gone to his house. EMB had specifically accused his grandchild of being in their house. Well his grandchild is five and was in kindergarten. Again, no one had been in the house.

So I don't know what to do. I could probably find their son as I know his name and where he lives, but they have had nothing to do with him in years. I could do nothing as they are not related to me, but I have been their friend and care giver for years and want to help. I know who they are now is not who they are.

And I really need to stop them calling my neighbors and telling them terrible things about me that are simply figments of their dementia.

I could also call their home state where they are now and have them do a mental welfare check on them.

I just don't know.

TLDR - Elderly neighbors have lost their minds and are making wild accusations. Don't know if I should help or walk away.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/cuuy01/my_elderly_neighbors_have_developed_debilitating/,legaladvice,1551,56,0.0

Mother passed away, and within a week older sister &amp; caretaker of mom for 2 years had gotten our mother with dementia to sign over $250K, bought a house, put it in her name, and had about $20K left over that she kept, and hid it from me for a year.  She realized I had a good idea of the value of our mother’s estate and admitted it to me.

I tried to work with her, and get her to pay out the other siblings what their fair share of the $250K would have been to them/us, she refused and cut off communication.

I filed a police report for financial elder abuse, the detective just emailed me, he subpoena’d medical &amp; financial records, and is having sister come in for an interview in the next week.

They didn't have paystubs and upon many requests were never given any. Everyone lost access to view their benefits online. We were told it was temporary.  It was not. 

 Fast forward a couple months they closed seven locations with no warning. We started having none of our supply orders filled and could barely maintain our clinics. It was told that they were having financial issues and things would improve. With the closures. 

 Then everyones 401k contributions stopped, even though they were still taken from paychecks. We were told it was temporary and they would be returned. By this time a lot of people left, those that had contributed thousands to their 401k. I fortunately never had one.

I worked 114 hours before all of the locations closed. My manager called me crying. She told me to send a demand for payment and file a complaint for wage theft, and get on unemployment. I did all of those but for unemployment they are saying they have no records of any of us working there. We are unsure if quarterly taxes were done. One employee was (almost?) arrested because his child payments weren't being made. 

It's made local news, and I heard from there that the state (CO) is investigating this, but all efforts to contact the owner has returned nothing. 

My questions are; Should I go to small claims court for my final paycheck? Does it cost me to do that? What do I do if my taxes were not being witheld and were instead being taken by the company?

i_speak_only_truth,2019-08-19 11:59:09+00:00,"Greyhound left me overnight at border crossing, lost 7k carry on bag, offered 4 dollars compensation","Hi, I'm posting this since I'm at my wit's end right now bashing my head into Greyhound customer service. To make a long story short, I traveled Friday night from Ontario to NYC. I booked a ticket that was supposed to transfer at city B at night and arrive at NYC in the morning.

The first bus leaving from city A to B was delayed by almost two hours, so I missed my connecting bus. Agents were no help and told me ""you might have to wait till tomorrow morning"". Upon arrival at terminal B, I spoke to a ticketer there who apologized and managed to get me on the last bus leaving to NYC for the night. Since it was on such short notice, they didn't reissue a ticket and told me not to worry, they'd get me to my destination.

When we arrived at the border crossing, we were all told to leave our stuff on the bus and bring only what we needed to cross the border. Since I was slotted in I was processed last. While I was going through customs, the bus left without me, which the CBP official said was a violation  since bus drivers cannot leave without receiving proper headcount and an OK from the border officials. I was left stranded freezing overnight with just my passport, phone, and wallet.

I called Greyhound right away to let them know what had happened, gave them the bus number and itinerary, but they refused to contact the bus driver to secure my carry on baggage. They also refused to grab it right away after the bus arrived, stating ""it will eventually cleaned and maybe end up the lost and found."" The next bus only arrived at 10am, 7 hours later.

When I finally arrived in NY, surprise surprise my unattended bag had been stolen and had not ended up in lost and found. After several calls, they finally admit wrongdoing and have offered me a 4 dollar ""trouble voucher"" as compensation, citing that unfortunately since I was not reissued a ticket in the system they cannot do anything for me and they are not responsible for carry on bags.

Lastly, I might have some recourse through my credit card insurance, however, Greyhound refuses to even provide any evidence that the lost baggage claim exists, which is necessary for my insurance claim.

What can I do, legally? I had 2 laptops and a Switch and items totalling 7k in the bag.

Kenova22,2019-08-18 11:44:20+00:00,Website refuses to take down the ad for seasonal renting of our squated house,"So, this is a bit muddy because the website is international (and very popular, starts with a B), the house is in France, the owners (us) are French but the house is squated by UK citizens.

Namely, my husband's family, who we let in the house graciously. After a few years, because of bad blood we asked to get our house back, they refused. Here again we are rather in the dark, we are communicating through lawyers but it has been on a stand by since June, I think our lawyer is crap but that's another matter.

We originally bought this house to rent it to tourists but never got a chance (the family moved in the moment we bought it).

Now, they were legally asked to leave by the 1st of June (I have shown the paper to the website). Obivously they didn't, but on top of that, they have been renting rooms to tourists since March.

I contacted the website, provided them with proofs of ownership etc, expressed my desire to see the illegal renting stop. I called several times, sent several mails, starting April. While it was momentarily made unavailable, the renting has continued and still is going on. 

Last time I called, the guy told me that it was up to their law service, he couldn't say/do anything. I threatened to go to the police, he encouraged me to do so. Unfortunately, the police won't do anything, I have to go to the tribunal and ... pay a lot of money that I don't have.

I then appealed to the law that says I can ask for my personnal data to be taken off a website, as there are pictures of our house, exact location etc... same thing, temporary disabled then back on the website, no answer.

From what I understand, the squaters have bought another house and are making the most of our house to make profit during summer before hopefully leaving, but at that rate i'm wondering if they are ever gonna leave if they can rent it for the whole year. I would really want to see it shut down.

legalhelppls43,2019-08-16 13:00:25+00:00,Minnesota: Landlord let people into my apartment and they robbed me. What now?,"For some background I am renting an apartment and my lease ends on September 30th. My landlord is an older guy who inherited this house; not a professional company or anything like that. I do have a lease that says I get 24 hours notice for entry except emergencies which I believe is the law itself, but in this case I did not get that notice.

Last week my landlord texted me shortly after 8AM saying someone is interested in buying the house from him (he has not previously brought up selling it so this was unexpected). He asked if I could let them in to see the place at 10, and then at 9:30 texted again saying he's guessing I'm at work so he's just going to let them pick up a key from them and lock up when they are done looking.

I did not see these messages until I took lunch at 12. I texted my landlord back saying I thought I am supposed to get notice for entry and I'm not comfortable with him letting people in unattended, he said sorry but they are going out of town and won't be back for two weeks so it was an emergency (though I'm sure that doesn't legally count).

Long story short they robbed me and I have it on security video but police weren't able to get much information from it because their vehicle is common and has no license plate, and they wore hoods and bandanas so you can't tell much about their faces. They took everything of value such as laptop and TV and even some stupid things like my lamps.

My renter's insurance originally was going to cover it but said they need a copy of the police report, and the police report explains the situation that my landlord gave them a key (as opposed to them breaking in). Now the renter's insurance says they cover breaking and entering resulting in loss but these circumstances makes it a civil issue instead of an insurance issue and I should seek to get reimbursed for my losses by my landlord instead.

Meanwhile my landlord is an idiot and did not even know these people. He met them at Dennys, only got their first names and gave them his phone number but didn't get theirs. I told him my renter's insurance won't cover this and because this was caused by him literally giving strangers a key to the place I would like him to reimburse me for my losses, he says he's sorry but at the end of the day it's these guys that owe me and not him and offered to talk to the police more to give them more description to find the guys but that's all he can do to help.

What now? Push my renter's insurance, sue the landlord, give up and cry? I would appreciate any advice anyone might have on what my best option is at this point.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/cr610d/minnesota_landlord_let_people_into_my_apartment/,legaladvice,16256,118,0.0

* My lawyer sent demand for full amount of security deposit to landlord's lawyer, who replied saying she no longer represented him
* My lawyer got reply from landlord saying he would pay the amount owed after deducting $3000 for his ""valuable time"" spent trying to find a suitable light fixture to replace one we had damaged. (His math was $500/hr @ 6 hours) 
* My lawyer replied by rejecting the offer, and telling the landlord that he ""genuinely wished you had legal representation so they could advise you as to the precariousness of your legal position"", and that unless he pays the full amount we'd be pursuing the matter in Superior Court where we'd be seeking double the deposit amount, damages for emotional distress, and court and attorney's fees 
* Landlord shit his pants and over-nighted a certified check for the full deposit.

My parents died when my brothers and I were young (Eldest was 11, Second (the brother in question) was 7, and I was 5). They left money for each of us once we turned 18 to help with college and life expenses. I turned 18 last year, and went through the process of getting the money. It was in March 2019 that I finally got it. It turned out to be a large sum- around $230,000. I decided to split the the money into two accounts- $75,000 into a savings account that no one was suppose to be able to touch, and the rest into my checking account. I wasn't spending much every month, and my grandma has only taken out a few thousand to take care of bills, but that was only $1000-$2000 a month (so a maximum of $12000 by this time).

Yesterday, it came to my attention that my entire checking account had been bleed dry- only $200 dollars to my name. I called the bank, and we found several instances of transfers of large sums of money (from a range of $1000 to as much as $25000) over the six month period after I deposited the money. My savings account has also been taken from. I'll admit, I really should have been paying more attention, but I was sure only me and my grandma had access to them and I got no warning from the bank about any of these transfers. We tracked where the transfers were going, and they were going straight into my brother's account. He had somehow gotten ahold of my info. 

When I confronted him, he said he had spent it all and only had about $4000 left. He spent it all- a whole $197,000- on food and on in-game purchases. I know it sound unbelievable, but after looking at his bank statements, it's true. It's just line after line of Uber Eats, Postmates, and game purchases. My grandma wants me to forgive him and let him work to make the money back, but this man just finished community school and has no work expierence.

tomtomx2,2019-08-09 01:19:06+00:00,"My wife asked for a divorce, but said she wants to stay married for the benefits.","So here’s the situation.


My wife and I have been having trouble for about 15 months now. I’m military, and I was deployed when the trouble started. When I got home, we started seeing a marriage counselor, and that bore fruit for quite a while. Things came to a head about 3 months ago and I started seeing an individual counselor as well.


About 6-7 weeks ago, she moved out while I was at work. I came home to a half empty house and a letter taped to the garage door. Long story but we agreed to continue trying counseling, and I still continued to see my personal counselor.


Last week, after returning from a 2-week trip to see her family and a few friends, she asked for a divorce. It broke my heart. She called me toxic and says I’ve treated her poorly and manipulated her and controlled her for years, which I don’t understand, but that’s not for this sub.


Here’s where I need the legal advice: she says she still wants to stay married on paper so can continue to receive financial support from me (I’m bound by regulation to do so) as well as healthcare (while she’s my dependent, she receives full coverage from TRICARE). She wants that arrangement to continue until she finishes her RN in about a year and can gain full time employment.


Now…I’m not opposed to that. I love her, and I don’t want to see her left in the cold if something happens, and she’s in school full time and can’t support herself. I also don’t want a divorce, because I still love her, and she says she still loves me… but I do have principles, yknow? A marriage that’s only on paper for the benefits is a sham, or at the very least disingenuous, and could get me into a lot of trouble.


The compromise I asked her to consider was staying married, but if we do so, then we continue to try marriage counseling, individual counseling, etc, whatever it takes. I don’t feel that’s an unfair proposition.


In response she accused me of using her health as a bargaining chip to get what I want, but that couldn’t be further from the truth…while I’m married I can’t get any closure, I can’t move forward, I can’t try to meet someone else (that’s adultery, and a crime in the military’s books)…if we stay legally married all it does is prolong the pain and heartbreak that I’m feeling right now.


I’d planned on reaching out to military lawyers (JAG), but she said she’d already seen a lawyer on base, and that I can’t go because it’d be a conflict of interest…that can’t be right, can it? JAG is a huge thing where I’m at and I can’t possibly have to pay out of pocket when the service affords me a lawyer?


She also said if -I- chose to file, that she’d contest it and try to take me for everything (alimony, full coverage healthcare, etc). We’ve only been married for 3 years, and when she moved out she took half of all of our joint assets; I’ve been paying her the separation pay monthly and have the checks to prove it, and I’ve even still been contributing to her retirement/investment account monthly as well.


I feel like I’m being taken advantage of but I also don’t really know what my rights are as a husband. Please help.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/cnv6x4/my_wife_asked_for_a_divorce_but_said_she_wants_to/,legaladvice,1110,54,0.0

I was given an albuterol inhaler and that's it medication-wise.

Was screened for cancer and TB, both results came back negative, was unable  to get further testing done in Guam due to lack of accommodations at their hospital, am currently back in mainland US but the Navy's making it a fight to even see my primary doctor just to *get a referral* to see a cardiologist, radiologist and pulmonologist for follow-up testing.

brippo12,2019-08-06 00:25:38+00:00,"Salesman forged my signature, company agrees he did it, won't refund my money. (TX)","Two weeks ago a pest control salesman knocked on my door. He let me know they were servicing other houses in the area and basically gave me the rundown of what they offered. I listened because my wife had recently complained about ants and thought the current special they were running sounded like a good enough deal. He pulls out an iPad, enters in my info (phone number, email, address), we agree on a day for the company to service my yard and I give him my card number to enter. He moves to the next screen where I am supposed to sign a contract.

This is where I started to become wary of the whole thing. He did not let me know that the company required me to sign a 12 month contract until I said out loud ""this is for 12 months?"" To which he quickly brushed off and pointed for the second time to where I should sign with my finger on the iPad. I was uncomfortable with the deal and let him know I was having second thoughts and ultimately did not want to proceed. He said it wasn't a problem, that he'd email me the contract to look over and to give him a call if I changed my mind.

Fast forward to the next day, my wife and I are pulling into our street as a van for this company is leaving our house. They leave a note on the door saying that our house had been serviced. I am immediately alarmed. I tried calling the company's corporate number, the local number just passed you off to corporate, but it was outside of business hours. Because it was a Friday evening I had to wait for Monday to roll around. 

Once I get ahold of a human on the phone, they let me know that I had in fact signed the contract, meaning that the salesman had taken it upon himself to forge my signature. I ask for it to be cancelled and for a copy of said contract. The salesperson had never emailed it to me and when I asked for a copy, they had my email misspelled, despite me having seen it correctly typed out on his iPad. 

The ""signature"" is clearly a bunch of scribbles. It literally looks like 4 vertical lines and a circle. 
After calling again I make a big fuss and am passed up the call centers chain of command. The manager lets me know that the contract has been cancelled and that I would be getting a refund. He calls me back after talking to the branch manager of my area to let me know the sales person has received a written warning and his other files will be reviewed. 

A week goes by and I don't receive a refund so I called them back today. I am told that because services were rendered, I would not receive my money back. It does not matter to them that it was not my signature, in fact they basically told me they were doing me a favor by not charging me the cancellation fee ($200). I argue that it's unreasonable for them to keep my money and they do not budge. 
I have filed a fraud report with my bank. What other steps do I need to take to fix this? I am also very upset that someone who forged my signature isn't even receiving more than a tap on the wrist.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/cmje91/salesman_forged_my_signature_company_agrees_he/,legaladvice,1601,55,0.0

My car was also parked on the sixth floor of the parking garage, and the valet employees still had my keys after my vehicle was stolen.  
After a day of fun, I returned to the hotel to have my car valet parked.

After around 20 minutes I was finally attended to, and was told since I already checked in the previous day that I was good to go, so I left my car with the engine turned off. When my friends and I woke up the next day to leave, we went down to the valet area to get my car, and we noticed it was taking a long amount of time for them to get my car.

nubbydog1969,2019-08-04 20:26:56+00:00,Being Forced to Continue Fostering an Aggressive Dog,"I have fostered dogs for 9 years. I have three of my own and currently have a foster out of NY ACC (Animal Care and Control). The rescue I'm working with shall remain nameless.  

I agreed to take this dog back in April. In the shelter she was very fearful and shutting down. She is an overbred mama dog who has very little trust in humans. When she got off the transport, I leashed her and took her out of the van with no problem. She has been very dominant with my dogs, but they tolerate her and yield to her when she's bossy. She has no problem with me and is very trusting. She follows me everywhere, more so than even my own dogs. The problem is she does not like strangers, or males. My son is 14 and she aggressively guards me against him. He can't get near me when she is around. When I walk her she is reactive to strangers. She's a cute dog, kind of funny looking, and people stop me to ask about her, but her reaction is something out of Cujo.

I have told the rescue about this behavior and they have hired a trainer. The trainer came out to my house and suggested that I muzzle her and expose her to as much as possible. The problem is she is so completely out of control around strangers that it is frightening for people to be on the receiving end. I have tried several times to introduce her to people and she just freaks out. I thought perhaps it was because I was there, so I did a little test with one of my brave friends to see how she would react if I was not present. Still the same crazy barking lunging and aggression.

I am supposed to be training this dog to not be reactive to people. I am an elementary school teacher, not a dog trainer. Her aggressive behavior is far more than I signed up for. The rescue has been very abrasive and accusatory in that I'm not doing what I'm supposed to with this dog. I have no idea how she even passed the temperment test to ve released from the shelter. Again, not what I signed up for.  

I have appealed to the rescue explaining that not only does this dog not like my son, but I'm getting a foreign exchange student next week and I don't think it's a good idea to have this animal in my house. The rescue lady told me I am out of luck. And there is nowhere to put the dog. What recourse do I have?

Thank you to everyone who responded.  As I originally stated, we had a family that we would have loved to be the parents of our unborn child.  In a weird twist of fate they called my mom the next morning to let her know that they were currently in possession of their brand new (adopted)  6 day old child. It was unexpected but I am happy for them.

&amp;#x200B;

As for us, we promptly contacted an adoption agency.  We got the ball rolling and went through many profiles of couples wanting to adopt.  We have decided on a couple, two college educated, married professional women.  I met them yesterday and I felt like I have known them my whole life.  I made a couple of demands 1) I wanted them in the delivery room-I felt like this would be a beautiful experience for them. 2) That they stay with me during my recovery period in the hospital. They were sobbing when I made these requests.  So I am pretty sure it is something they are fine with.  We have also agreed on an open adoption.  Yes, I know what an open adoption means and it's not legally binding. Ultimately, I just want this child to be in a safe and loving family. 

As far as the legal, I meet with my guardian ad litem on Monday and will be induced on Friday if I do not go into labor on my own.

It seemed like there was no harm sharing the evidence, as long as it was unmodified (it was not modified).

The manger of the dealership has finished reviewing the footage and called me yesterday to set up a meeting to discuss the abuse to my car. 

To summarize everything that occurred;

1) CPO Vehicle was damaged upon pickup, I foolishly agreed to let the dealer fix it rather than taking my Credit Union's check and leaving

2) Repair work was less than average in quality, clear coat runs, body panel still was damaged (it was a fender and it was still bent on the inside). Found the passenger fog light is also damaged after the repair, dealer claims I bought the car like that, its a CPO and it should have been inspected (as per Manufactorer's inspection sheet). 

3) dealer agrees to fix it again, I drop the car off during my 2 week long vacation. Car sits at the lot, gets joy ridden back and fourth between the body shop (~75 miles round trip), Body shop wet sands clear coat, doesn't address additional damage, says ""we stand by our work.""

4) Found footage, emailed dealership with clip of footage explaining I am upset and want compensation for the wear to my vehicle, unhappy with the body repairs that are still not done properly.

5) ~1month to get a response, had to reach out to Corporate customer relations to get the dealer to respond after multiple phone calls/voice mails and no returned calls.

6) Dealership manager reaches out, wants video footage of incidents, I dropped footage off 

7) setup meeting with manager this coming week to follow up and discuss.

The car was ran to redline multiple times, the driver seemed to not be very good at driving stick, so he/she frequently was riding the clutch during these jaunts to high RPM, he clutch dumped it once causing wheel hop/spinning tires.

I am not sure what kind of compensation I should see to be acceptable (legally speaking).

I guess she got the hint. Came over to pick me up for a romantic evening. I am a functioning alcoholic , in therapy. Proceeds to drink with me and gets me completely wasted.

Ronni3r,2019-07-31 13:12:22+00:00,"Given incorrect dose of Allergy Shot, went into anaphylactic shock and health provider refuses to cover my expenses. What to do?","I've been getting allergy shots for close to 2 years and have been at a maintenance dose for more than a year (receiving the same concentration) .

My regular visit usually goes like this: Nurse asks me preliminary questions, shows me vials of various concentrations (blue - 1:10000 concentration, yellow - 1:1000 concentration, red - 1:100 high concentration), verifies the vial to be administered, verifies my name and date of birth on the vial, then proceeds to administer the shot. I wait 30 minutes to ensure that no major allergic reactions occur. During my maintenance dose, I usually receive 1 mL of the yellow vial.

During this visit, the nurse I usually get my shots from wasn't administering the shot. The nurse did not ask my the usual preliminary questions, did not verify my name/date of birth on the vial, had the syringes pre-loaded with the allergy shot serum and proceeded to administer the shot. I look at the counter where the vials are usually placed and all I saw were only the red vials, which is the 10x the concentration I usually receive. I didn't think of anything since the other vials might've been placed somewhere else. So I begin the 30 minute waiting period.

After 20 minutes of waiting, I feel really flush, itchy, and hot. I begin to suspect that the red vial was administered to me. The nurse checks up on me, I tell her that I'm getting a reaction. She puts her hands to her face, sighs, then mumbles ""Why me?"". I tell her she might've administered the red vial to me since it was the only vial I saw on the counter and she denies that she had given that to me. At this point, I'm going into analphylactic shock. The nurse calls a doctor and another nurse, administer an epi-pen, and call the ambulance to send me to the ER. The allergic reaction subsets after 5 hours in the ER. 

I filed a grievance with the clinic manager to see if I could get all my expenses covered however they couldn't conclude that they had given me the incorrect dose. This is close to $2000 in out of pocket expenses after insurance. I request my medical records and see that there is no clear evidence of what concentration was administered to me. I look at the ambulance EMT notes, and they noted I was given double the allergy shot dose. 

3 weeks after my allergic reaction, I go in to get another allergy shot and my main nurse notifies me that it was charted I was given the 1mL of the  red - 1:100 high concentration dose. This doesn't appear in my medical records for the day of my appointment, it doesn't even show what I was administered on that day. Now I want to take legal action against the clinic however I have no idea where to start, what to do, and how to approach the situation. Any advice is appreciated.

Hi, 

So, for the past year or so, someone has been ordering food to our house super late at night (10 pm, midnight) and my family and I are entirely fed up with it. We have asked these places not to deliver to us, but for some reason they keep on delivering to us. We asked for the number that the person is using, and it's a google voice number which I have had no luck in tracing. One of the times, we got the police involved and documented the incident and he said he was going to send it to a cyber detective, but we have heard nothing on that. 

I don't know if this matters, but they order pork dishes to our house and we're Muslim.

He then told me to make sure I told my boyfriend because he wanted to start a physical altercation in order to get him arrested. He even told my boyfriend's brother, but he didn't say anythin because he didn't want to cause a fight.

What are my options?","My daughter just started a medication that causes upset stomach and frequent urination/defecation. The doctor says these are normal initial side effects and generally go away, but he wrote her a note stating this so she could get a special bathroom pass from the school nurse so she can go whenever she needs to. This all worked out fine and she had no problem getting this pass from the nurse.

Last week I got a call from the school saying that she had an accident and I needed to come pick her up. They didn't say anything else so I just figured that she had just tried to hold it since she doesn't like interrupting anyone and it didn't work out for her. When I got there she was BAWLING in the office and the secretary kept shooting her these annoyed and disgusted looks. I signed her out and took her home, she cried the whole time. I told her it was okay, and that it wasn't her fault, but that next time when she had to go, she needed to tell her teacher.

Well, she tells me that she *did* tell the teacher but the teacher said no. Apparently the teacher had taken the whole class to the restroom/water fountains on a break around 20-30 minutes before she asked to go. She just got water but didn't need to use the restroom. But when she did, she asked the teacher who told her no. She tried to show the teacher the pass, but the teacher wouldn't even look at it and told they just went and she should have gone then. My daughter went back to her desk and a few minutes later she had the accident. She said the teacher screamed at her in front of the whole class telling her that behavior was ""inappropriate"" and that she doesn't just get to do whatever she wants and that she's expected to be in class just as much as everyone else. This was confirmed by two of her friends who were also in the class. I reached out to the school, who initially tried to tell me that my daughter never showed her the pass, but when I told them I had at least two other kids who would say that she absolutely did, they just kept telling me that the teacher wasn't aware of her condition and just wanted to make sure she wasn't just trying to get out of class. When I asked about how she *screamed* at my daughter in front of the class, the said they had no evidence or knowledge of that every happening, and that they are sorry and that the teacher had been notified of her medical condition.

So my lease for this apartment ends July 31st. Early in the spring, I decided I didn't want to renew as I wanted something cheaper. I found a house that worked better for me and the lease for that started June 1st, so I have two places in my name as of right now. I moved out of the apartment in the second week of June and I have been living in the house ever since, while still paying rent for the apartment to finish out the lease.

I get a call from the apartment complex today, saying they've received complaints of trash outside my apartment door (which is where we are supposed to leave our trash bags for the trash service to pick up and take to the dumpster). She said they have a photo of 15 bags of trash in the area near my front door where trash is supposed to be. She said that the trash service only takes away one bag of trash a day, and they are going to charge me $25 per bag of trash if I don't take it to the dumpster myself. 

I inform the woman that I moved out last month, and told her that they are welcome to enter the apartment to confirm I am no longer there, as it is 100% cleaned out. She told me that she will call my neighbor, who with the way the front doors are positioned, puts his trash bags in the same place as me. She said she will check with him and if he disputes it, they will go through the trash and it will be ""obvious who's it is"". 

The reason I am resisting taking it out myself, is that I live on the third floor of what I will call an outdoor apartment building, meaning that when I open my front door, I am outside (versus closed apartment buildings where you open your front door to an indoor hallway). It's been 100 degrees with humidity, I'm on the third floor, and even once I walk down the two flights of stairs to the bottom, I am a football field length away from the nearest dumpster. I am a girl, so I would only be able to handle two trash bags at a time, which would mean 8 trips up and down two flights of stairs, in the heat walking all the way across the complex in the sun.

I have a strong feeling my neighbor is going to dispute it, and they are going to believe him over me, as he is a 40 something year old doctor at the local hospital, and I am a mid twenties college student at the local university.

Cops can't find him when we call them.,"I'll spare the details of the breakup, but essentially my sister's ex has been bothering us for about half a year now. Relevant events since the start of 2019 include:

1. Filing a restraining order and being granted a temporary restraining (about 3 months ago)
2. Ex being arrested for violating the temporary restraining order and being jailed for a day.
3. Getting the permanent restraining order
4. Being arrested for violating the permanent restraining order for a month and being released on parole. Parole conditions explicitly state he is to not contact my sister or be within her vicinity.

Despite being on parole, he's playing ding dong ditch at random times during the late night for the past week. We have video evidence of him being here through our Ring doorbell. We've called the cops multiple times and they take a while to get here and by that time they can't find him (or they don't try too hard).

Her ex is homeless, living in his car (probably), and disowned by his parents so we don't really have a clue where he is during the day.

It was easier to get him arrested the first couple times because he actually stuck around for someone to open the door, but now he's given up on that completely and he does not seem in his right mind anymore. Last time I spoke with him, he claimed to be hearing voices and we've heard him talking to himself a couple times on the Ring videos. He's not doing anything violent, but you never know, he could snap and do something crazy one day.

My sister spoke to his probation officer and told her the situation. He's currently scheduled to appear to court next month to address his probation violation.

He is on some type of disability payments.   I would say I am an acquaintance to them. Talked to them a few times, a little friendly and such.

He said a family friend and his ""fiance"" had him sign a few documents related to the house, but wouldn't tell him what the documents were for and he just signed them.  I looked up his house with the county and both the mom and son are on the deed.  He said his mom also had a $10K insurance policy and he doesn't know where that money went.

&amp;#x200B;

He is scared that the family friend and ""fiances"" family are trying to steal his house.  After he called me, I had him go over everything with me.  There were a few red flags but everything could either be someone trying to help him (money to pay the mortgage, food, etc) or someone trying to steal the house from a distraught mentally challenged person.

I give it 80% they are helping him and 20% chance they are trying to steal his inheritance.  He has not seen an attorney.  I would imagine he needs an attorney to settle his mom's estate.

&amp;#x200B;

I would like to send him to an attorney and extricate myself.  I am afraid that a regular probate attorney won't have the skills to deal with him (mentally challenged).  

&amp;#x200B;

My main concern is that no one is trying to steal his home.  Does anyone have any advice for me? :(

beefwitted_brouhaha,2019-07-20 13:24:24+00:00,"Witnessed car crash one month ago during honeymoon in FL, stayed around to give report to responding officer. Live in MA and just received subpoena to appear in court in August.","It was the first day of our honeymoon in Florida when we witnessed a car crash. My first instinct was to check the traffic lights at the moment of the crash so I could clearly tell who was at fault. My wife and I hung around the scene of the accident (no serious injuries thankfully) and gave our report to the traffic officer who responded. We felt good about ourselves for sticking around and doing our civic duty and figured that was that. 

Today, over a month later, we both received subpoenas in the mail to appear in court in mid August. The court is located in Florida but we live in Massachusetts. We are also both starting new jobs in the first week of August. 

I would REALLY not like to have to fly down to Florida on my own dime to testify, do I have any other options? Are any of the parties involved compelled to reimburse me for my travel expenses? Or am I SOL and should I just look for the cheapest flight down there ASAP? I’m feeling like that whole “no good deed goes unpunished” saying has never been truer.

I received letters in the mail for (1) and (3) and an email from (2). I quickly followed the directions in the letter for (1) and emailed the head of the program, the program secretary, the head of assistantship placements, and also Professor X that I had been corresponding with on research. No replies from any of them, but I excused it because it was April and was deadweek/finals.

Three months later (two weeks ago), I remember that I have no information on my program that is starting next month and re-email Professor X asking about assistantships. He replies immediately and says that when I emailed him in April, he checked with the head of the program and found out that I wasn't admitted. For some reason, he didn't see it fit to respond to me and let me know that there was an error in my admittance. 

In talking to the secretary today (that also failed to respond to me in April), I find out that the program coordinator for choice (3) somehow accidentally accepted me to choices (1) and (3) -- secretary has no clue how that happened and thinks that it's likely that my offer will be rescinded because it is a competitive school. 

..I'm floored because #1, I quit a very well-paying and enjoyable job to go back to school and #2, I have already signed a lease in a city that I otherwise wouldn't have moved to. Further, if I wouldn't have gotten into (1), then I absolutely was going to accept (2) and move in the opposite direction. Now I'm screwed because I already have a lease and can't afford to pay two at one time on a student's earnings.

Do I have any legal recourse? Professor X said that he *knew* back in April that I wasn't accepted and just chose to never respond to me. The likely scenario now is that I might be able to get into my last choice -- but at this point there is no way that funding is still available. Let me know if there is any more information that I can provide.

He usually borrows my photography gear regularly and this is the first time he dissappeared completely. Before he dissappeared he agreed to borrow my gear for a day only.

He has been deliberately avoiding me for about 10 days before I thought of asking help from his friends and families thru social media private message.

I have even filed a report to the local authorities on the 5th day, but this was taking too long and I need my gear for an event! So I decided to asked for help from his contacts.

This was effective as some of his families contacted him when they saw my message to them. The day after that he shows up and returned all of my gear. It turns out that some of them got damaged but he promised to pay for them.

He is now threatening to file a case against me for humiliating him to his contacts. But if I haven't done that, I don't think I can get my gear back!

This was my message to his contacts:

""Hello, if you know Mr xxxx please tell him to return my photography gear as I have been trying to reach him and he is deliberately evading me! He borrowed my gear 10 days ago and he has not returned it. I need the gear badly and this is costing me too much.

HoldmyGlocky,2019-07-18 00:21:09+00:00,"[FL] Transmission shop destroyed my girlfriends center console, and is completely outing her life in google reviews","My girlfriend took her car to this transmission shop to get it fixed and they ended up spending like $4k on a brand new transmission to be put in. 

Two weeks later, the tranny started acting up again with the exact same issue so she took it back and when she came back to retrieve the car after it was repaired, she found her entire center console was destroyed. 

When she said something to the owner, he completely denied it and said they didn't do it, and it was completely destroyed and for sure wasn't like that before it was brought in. My girlfriend didn't want to get into a confrontation, so when he proceeded to call her a bitch for the accusations, she said fuck you and walked out and slammed the door.

The guy ended up chasing her out of the shop, screaming in her face which is when his wife came running out and got in between them. My girlfriend then got in the car, and left and called the cops. They sent an officer out there and he told her, if she wants the parts replaced, her best chance is to write a letter to the shop. Like WTF. 

We then left 1 star google reviews, and less than 24 hours later, six or seven 5 star reviews popped up with the most generic reviews of the shop, and then at the end of the reviews, they would completely blast me and my girlfriend calling us dumb college kids and saying we were lying about the entire situation, even though there is photos of the center console attached to my girlfriends review.

One guy even said he was there while it happened and watched it go down, when it was just my gf and the owner! 

The weirdest thing that triggered me to post this, was that today we noticed another review. It's written like one of her friends wrote it, and they completely dropped every piece of information of her life, saying shes crazy because of certain things, so don't trust her reviews and that it's a really good place. It was weirdly specific, stating places she used to live 4 years ago and stuff about her father and step father. 

We have lived in this city for like 4 months, and havent met anyone that would know any of that information which is leading me to believe they hired a PI or maybe have connections to the cops in this city to pull all of that information.

scammeddad,2019-07-17 02:04:52+00:00,"(Utah) My dad keeps getting scammed, doesn't believe anyone, has ruined he and my moms lives, can we stop him from sending more money?"," 

Tl;dr: my dad has been scammed multiple times even though we’ve told him it was a scam. He is either being blackmailed or is mentally ill. Is there anything my mom/me/my siblings do.

A bit of background about my dad, because I feel like its relevant. My dad isn’t a smart guy, he is very trusting and has taken what his friends have told him over his family.

About a year and a half ago my mom thought my dad had a “girlfriend”. Well we found out he was actually being scammed with the usual Egyptian prince scam. He thought he had married and gave her about $100,000 to help her get her inheritance. My dad had taken some of the documents to my brother and asked him if he thought they were real and he told him they weren’t. He still wired the money. My dad had this woman call and talk to my mom to try and convince her that she wasn’t really my dad’s wife or girlfriend, that she really just wanted to be part of our family and give them money. 

We all sat down (my siblings, my parents and I) and laid out to my dad that he was scammed and he wouldn’t be getting any money back etc. he broke his phone (why? No idea when he could have just changed his number). He bought a new phone and changed his phone number. We all thought that was the end, until in January my dad called and told me that he had continued to send this woman money, totaling about $300,000. 

Here is where things get absolutely insane. My brother and I meet with my mom at his house and start getting the rundown of what the hell happened here. My mom said that even though we all told him he was being scammed he didn’t believe us at all. My mom kept telling him he was being scammed and he would tell her that he couldn’t wait to get his money so he could laugh in all of our faces. At some point these people and my dad convinced my mom for a while that it wasn’t a scam. My dad cashed out all of his stocks, his sweet coin collection, pawned all of this guns (including a nice rifle that had belonged to my great grandpa). He convinced my mom to get a second mortgage because they were about to be rich. My parents paid off their brand new truck and travel trailer. My mom dipped into her 401k. They totally wiped out all of the savings they had. When the money didn’t come my mom told my dad she was 100% done and that he was being scammed.

This didn’t stop my dad. He used the titles of the truck and trailer to borrow against them. He borrowed $10,000 from his best friend. He then maxed out all of his credit cards buying gift cards and did the same to my moms credit cards. When my mom got her statements that’s when she found out that he was STILL giving them money. She told him he better tell us kids or she would do it. So he called us and told us. He seemed to really believe that he had been scammed this time. We were all super duper mad because he ruined not only his life but my moms too. They have to file bankruptcy and lose everything they’ve ever wanted.

Time went on and I was sort of trying to forgive my dad a bit because I do love him. My mom called me and told me that my dad was telling one of his clients about being scammed and she knew someone who had been scammed and had some of it recovered and my dad got the guys contact information and was in the process to see if this guy could help them too. My mom was so excited about it she told my sister on her birthday and asked me not to tell her before.

Flash forward to last Monday, my dad called my husband asking him if he could come down and help fix his computer, that Microsoft tech support called and showed him all this stuff wrong with his computer. My husband asked if he installed anything and he said no, but he let them REMOTE into his computer. My husband told him to turn it off. We went over to their house so my husband could look at it. He’s trying to see if he can just clean it out and avoid reformatting.

While my husband was waiting for stuff to run he notices an email from “alex” and can tell immediately it’s another scam. He looks at the website he sent in the email, so fake!! I could tell as soon as he showed me. So he calls my dad outside and shows him how fake it is. My dad asks extremely surprised at this information, my husband explained to him how he's on a suckers list now and that any real recovery company can’t ask for money for 7 days after the money has been recovered and my dad had already given them $5,000 from his BUSINESS checking account, the fake website had fields for bank account numbers and routing numbers, that he put in. My dad came inside and told my mom that the website was fake. My mom had a very nonchalant attitude about it and said “oh well, nothing we can do about it now”. There was no way my husband was going to be able to recover his computer so we decided to take it home to reformat it.

My husband looked through his emails to make sure there wasn’t anything else he was potentially getting scammed on. Here’s a few highlights:

The arrest form the recovery scam sent was completely blank.

He thought was going to get back 2 million dollars even though he only lost $300,000.

The documents the guys were sending him from the original scam were SO bad that you could literally google them. The CEO of bank of america wasn’t even the same person anymore and his name wasn’t even spelled correctly. The dates were written European style on and on.

My dad sent 3 brand new iphone XR’s tip top of the line to someone in South Africa.

He has given them his SSN, a picture of his driver's license, his parents full names, his grandparents full names and a picture of his whole passport.

Here’s the kicker… before my dad sent the recovery scammer money he asked my brother what he thought and my brother told him the SAME EXACT thing my husband told him and he did it anyway.

I called my mom and told her not to believe anything my dad says and to check with my husband in the future. She told me that she knew as soon as they started asking for money that it was a scam but he didn’t believe her and at this point she just doesn’t care anymore and is just trying to get the bankruptcy pushed through so she can divorce my dad.

I’m worried that my dad is going to do something that is going to hurt their bankruptcy filing by continuing to be scammed, get them in legal trouble some how and give away more money they 100% don’t have. Is there something my mom can do to take away his ability to make any sort of financial transactions? Can she force him to give his phone over and have my husband lock down his computer so he only has access to quick books? Is there anything we can do to stop him? My husband thinks he is being blackmailed but I just think he is losing his mind/mentally ill. I just want to protect my mom as much as I can from any further damage.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/ce6k07/utah_my_dad_keeps_getting_scammed_doesnt_believe/,legaladvice,4765,131,0.0

Please Help!","Someone who lives across the road from a plot of preserved open space I own has been weed whacking about 25 feet into my land. When asked why, he positively flipped out and refused to stop, so my partner called the police. They told him not to weed whack anymore. So then I see him last night wandering around the area he weed whacked. I approached him to ask him why he's doing this. He was spitting fire screaming that since it's in the ""right of way"" he can do anything he wants. Then he complained that he doesn't want the drainage system Penn Dot put in to get clogged with weed roots. To which I said ok but that's Penn Dot's job to maintain and they've already been through, and he just flipped out. Then he's mad about vines on a power line to which I said ok if that's an issue the utility companies would be the ones to address that. He didn't like that either. Then his wife came outside and he started physically shoving her. It was a disaster.  


I now see that he has cut down a number of small, healthy hardwoods on my land. Ash, cherry, and sassafras. This is very upsetting to me as I'm a nature enthusiast and an herbalist and those trees, particularly cherry have value. Also they have aesthetic value because they formed a barrier between my land and a busy road.  


I don't know how to prove he cut the trees. We caught him cutting a tree back maybe a year ago and asked him to stop and he went crazy. Years before that he personally asked me if he could cut my trees because his wife wanted a better view and I told him no. There's no reason to believe anyone else did this, and I have a police report about the weed whacking so he seems the likely culprit.  


Please advise. I want this guy off my land, I want him to stop cutting anything of mine ever again and I want damages for my trees. I live in Pennsylvania, the land in question is an agricultural preserve in PA Act 319, and it's all happening maybe within 50 feet of a state road.

A little backstory, bought my house in February 2019. All was cool but then I started having problems with my elderly neighbor's 40 year old daughter that still acts like shes 20. Driving through my property, trespassing constantly, parking in my driveway. The driveway is between our two houses and there is no fence or anything as of yet, something I will be remedying soon. Bringing all sorts of trash over to her house to talk shit about me and my family because I won't let them trespass on my property.

According to my other neighbors this is a constant problem, and always has been. She used to do the same thing to the 93 year old man that lived in this house. Yelling at him, and even ran over his grill with her car once. He seemed to never do anything, except put up a fence in the back that was rotting and falling when I bought the house, and home insurance made me take it down prior to purchasing the home. 

I have never had any issues with any of my neighbors in all the places I've lived, and so this is a fairly new phenomenon to me. Well, anyway the problem came to a head when I called the police on them one night because she was sitting in my driveway in a car with a bunch of shady individuals. Earlier that day she had threatened to have someone ""come talk to me"" because I said I would be putting a gate in the driveway. 

They have no longer parked their cars in my property since this occurred, but now even though i don't even look in their general direction or even acknowledge them, this woman continues to talk trash and try to intimidate me. I have cameras on the property and have recorded every time she has been on my property without permission. It usually happens when I am not here. I had a survey done, and had the property marked and pinned, and this seems to have made the problem worse. She brings her weird druggy friends over and they stand around and point at the survey marks and talk trash loudly. 

Yesterday she started yelling racist things outside her home when my kitchen window was open, specifically about my ethnicity and background. I have gone to the police twice and they always say the same thing, just file it in civil court we can't do anything blah blah blah.

&amp;#x200B;

My mom and step dad are really into ""new age"" science and beliefs. I've never agreed with them on this and didn't know how extreme it was. Recently though they have become involved in a extremely weird ""support group"". I say that in quotes because I have no fucking clue who they are. When I'm around they never mention any group names or what ""organization"" they work for or are apart of. Because of this I have not had much luck finding out stuff as ""new age cult"" gives to many results to look into.

&amp;#x200B;

This Monday my mom and stepdad sat me and my 4 siblings down. They told us that we will be moving at the end of the month to a more ""stable"" location within a spiritual community. According to them they plan to pull all 5 of us (im 16, couldn't think of anywhere else to mention this.) out of school here and enroll us in their ""mind awakening"" school where ever we move. I tried to get anything out of them but they refused to talk to me at all about it. According to them because i'm still a child in ""mind, body, and spirit"" i need to listen to them not ask questions. I've actually been freaking out since then and have been trying to get advice but I've been unable too. They cut of the internet, phone and TV Tuesday and they have been keeping a fucking lazer focus on me and my siblings since then. I'm currently at a friends house and this is the only way I've actually got access to the internet. this seems like a cult 100% to me. Last night they had 3 people come and talk to me and my siblings and the stuff they told us was fucking crazy. I was talked to alone by an old man who told me about how my mind is ""closed"" and that I will slowly learn to open it as my parents have and that the ""leaders"" will love to meet me and put me in their programs. 

&amp;#x200B;

I need to know what the fuck I can do here. My dad has shared custody of me and since Monday i've had no contact with him. He is supposed to have a call with me every night but my mom claims he's been ""informed"" and supports this 100%. I tried calling him this morning but he didn't answer. He lives in another state so it's kinda hard to get into contact with him outside of phone and email. I'm at a friends house because I was able to leave the house for the first time in a week this morning after I told my parents I wanted to go to the park but came here and told my friend everything. Her parents are not home but she's trying to call them and I plan to stay here tonight if I can. My parents have forbid me from using the internet because it's ""full of lies from them"". 

&amp;#x200B;

Thrw_lost_dad,2019-07-12 12:25:54+00:00,[Update] on contacting the child I gave up for adoption 12 years ago,"A new update to [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/bpqws6/i_was_separated_from_my_child_12_years_ago_if/) and this first [update](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/c5gn9y/update_to_my_post_about_contacting_the_child_i/) as some people asked (I hope this is OK and I'm not breaking the sub's rules). Thanks again to the people at r/legaladvice.

I wrote a letter to my ex-wife. I spare you the detail but in it I apologized for what I've done and took responsibility for it. I also told her that I've made efforts to better myself and how I got my act together, and that I'm aware that she only has my word as proof for it and I know that's not much. I asked if she would let me know how she and my son were doing and if she'd be willing to share a bit about his life. I asked if he knows about me and if she thinks there's a chance she would let me contact him at some point in the future. I also added that I won't make any further attempt at contact if she doesn't answer or if she asks me to stop.

I really wasn't sure she would answer but she did. It was a long and emotional letter. I don't want to say too much but she says she has forgiven me and she's glad I'm doing better. She, my son and her husband are doing well. My son is a happy young man, he's doing great in school and has a nice group of friends. She finds him very mature for his age, he knows what he wants to do with his future. He has a good relationship with his parents and siblings. Reading this has been a huge relief, I'm so glad he's doing well. She said I was right to give him up for adoption however difficult it may have been. I knew it but reading it from my ex-wife has been incredibly comforting.

My son knows he's adopted, and he knows why his mom left with him and why he's never met me. Apart from that he doesn't know much about me. He has asked a few questions over the years and his mother has answered truthfully, and she writes that she hasn't bad mouthed me and I believe her. As for contacting him in the future, she'll think about it, but she and her husband need to talk about it first and see if my son wants it. And obviously my ex-wife and her husband will need to talk to me to see if I've changed for real. She said that she needs time to think about it and she doesn't want to rush things, but whatever they decide in the end she won't keep me in the dark.

So now all I've got to do is wait. This is a positive outcome, knowing my son is doing great is what I had been hoping for all these years and it helps a lot, even more than I would have expected. Even if I'm not sure if there will be contact in the future, there's hope so that's fine.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/cca739/update_on_contacting_the_child_i_gave_up_for/,legaladvice,5356,2,0.0

&amp;#x200B;

She spent yesterday trying to get the police to help.  They continued to basically blow her off, all the way up the chain to the sheriff himself.  They still insisted that she fill out [this form](https://imgur.com/a/ICB8vFB) (the part she is supposed to fill out is circled) and take it to the courthouse before doing anything, which she is going to do today.  They told her she will need to get a lawyer.  They said she can then call dispatch and get an escort to go to the house with her.  After she was done with them she tried just getting a locksmith to get into the house without a police escort, only to find there are no locksmiths in her entire county.     
 We don't know how to get into the house without breaking anything, so she is  still on my couch as of this post.  She is also going to call Adult Protective Services today as some people recommended in the original thread.  She is also waiting to hear back from some free legal services she reached out to on Monday.  Also, another detail, Aunt does not seem to be staying in the house.

Hello, as the title stated, my landlord came by when we were on vacation (we knew about it), and started complaining about the house. One of the complaints was that the cat was roaming the house freely. We texted him and said that if you are locking up the cat, make sure she had her water, food, and litter box. 

We came home to the doors closed, and cat was in a room without any of the three essentials.  She clawed the carpet trying to get out, peed and pood everywhere, and most importantly, visibly skinnier. Cat doesn't usually hang out in that room by herself, coupled with the landlord's complaint about her, we suspect he did it on purpose even though he insisted it was an accident. He is overseas now.

namechangehelp202020,2019-07-10 12:15:53+00:00,CT - Boss dictates weekend activities?,"Hello - writing on behalf of a friend ""John"". (x-posting to r/askhr)

In the past year, John started working at a new job. He loves what he does at his job but he's had some issues with some of the unspoken expectations that he has learned of as he has gone along (yes he is already looking for new employment). John works a typical Monday-Friday schedule with nights and weekends off. Occasionally during the times he's not at work, he will get phone calls from the people he supervises with questions. (Probably worth noting here that John is an exempt salaried employee.)

One weekend, John was moving into a new place and one morning his boss (let's call her Karen!) called telling him that he needed to come in to work because one of his direct employees had called out and there was no other employee at the same level that could cover. John explained to Karen that he was in the middle of moving and literally waiting for the moving truck to arrive at his new house. Karen told him that it was an emergency and these things happen ""sometimes"" and he HAD to come in. So John went in and myself and another friend met the truck at the house. 

The next instance was when John was at brunch. He again was called into work to cover for one of his direct reports. He told Karen that he absolutely could not come in as he had been drinking at brunch, had not taken his car to the restaurant, and felt he was too intoxicated to drive. Karen told him that he should ""watch what he does"" on the weekends. John wound up calling all of his direct employees and found someone that COULD cover. 

After this, John approached Karen about having some type of on-call schedule. His reasoning was that he totally understood that there were times that he would need to come in outside his regular hours but he felt that he couldn't live his life - he felt like he couldn't travel far from work, couldn't go out with friends, or couldn't be somewhere that he wasn't accessible by phone. Karen told him that ""this was nonsense"" and that he could do whatever he wants on his time off. John specifically pointed out the issue that happened with brunch and she told him that she doesn't drink and that she was ""surprised by his behavior"". John again stated he would feel more comfortable with some type of schedule so that if he knows he's the one that would be called in, he would stay close to his job and refrain from drinking. Karen said they would not be creating an on-call schedule and that he shouldn't worry about having to be called in since it happened infrequently.

So now we've reached the part where John asked me to look into this for him. Our friend group had planned an overnight outing (Saturday-Sunday) for next weekend at a location about four hours from where John works. Since John was not scheduled for those days, he didn't request any time off, figuring he would drive up on Friday evening and return Sunday evening. A few of us did take Friday off work so two weeks ago John asked if it would be possible for him to take that Friday off. Karen asked him why he wanted that Friday off so John explained that he had weekend plans and would like to leave a bit early if possible. Karen then told him that he could NOT go away for that weekend because she had weekend plans and he would need to be on call. He asked if any other employees that are at his level could be on call and Karen told him no because they also had other plans. Nobody had requested any time off because it was the weekend but I guess John was just the last to disclose his weekend plans? 

From his previous job, John is aware of a Connecticut law that says people cannot work more than six calendar days in one week or twelve consecutive days ([https://www.cbia.com/news/hr-safety/hr-hotline-many-consecutive-days-can-employees-required-work/](https://www.cbia.com/news/hr-safety/hr-hotline-many-consecutive-days-can-employees-required-work/)) but he is unsure of how this applies to being on call. John is working on-site this coming Sunday so if being on-call counts as working, that means he should be allowed to not work on Saturday, correct? 

Outside of this specific incident, is being on-call basically 24/7 even legal?",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/cbfzea/ct_boss_dictates_weekend_activities/,legaladvice,2998,188,0.0

Not only did they cut me a check, but 7 other employees who were affected like this were paid as well.  No signs of retribution either.

He didn’t even finish flushing the toilet. 

When I confronted him he became aggressive with me, made threatening gestures toward me and started trying to accuse me of wrongfully occupying the building, which is not the case.

And when I explained to him that I had every right to be there because I had permission from the tenant to be there, he said “okay, I’ll let you go this time.”

Pulmonic,2019-07-06 21:12:11+00:00,[UPDATE] Coworker is bragging about filing a false bite report to attempt to have their ex’s dog euthanized.

Glad to say I’ve got a happy update!

The coworker was indeed terminated the day her probationary period ended (7/1). I wasn’t working that day but apparently she just stormed out wordlessly when told. 

The ex has filed for a temporary restraining order and is working on a permanent one. He’s also installed home security cameras and carries a copy of the police report and a one page vet record showing the dog is spayed and vaccinated. The dog has also been to obedience school and they wrote a letter saying she hasn’t shown any human or dog aggression. 

Police and animal control are very good around here. They assured us both that euthanasia is an absolute last resort in any case  and that they’d require extra proof from this coworker should she report anything. Additionally, with the restraining order, the coworker can’t be “bitten” by the dog without violating it. And the department says they don’t allow totally anonymous reporting-you can keep your name secret from the dog’s owner but not the police/animal control. 

So the dog is safe, coworker let go, and ex is forewarned and forearmed. I’d call it a win!

Hinagea,2019-07-05 14:00:17+00:00,My wife and I were involved in a fatality car accident with a minor at fault. Who is responsible?,"On Sunday night we were the third car involved in a head-on collision for a vehicle traveling the wrong way down the road. I won't get into the details too much, but there were 3 individuals in the at fault vehicle that appeared to be traveling 10-20mph over the speed limit (40mph). They ended up crossing over the centerline and getting stuck on that side by a small median. The vehicle looked like it made an attempt to jump the median by swerving back towards it when it impacted an oncoming vehicle at which point it did jump the median and both vehicles collided with us.

The driver and one passenger fled the scene on foot, but were caught on Wednesday night. Unfortunately for the third passenger, they left her in the car and it caught fire in 2-3 minutes after the accident. She died of smoke inhalation.

To our knowledge and what has been reported it sounds like all 3 passengers were minors. The only reported age was under 15 so it's hard to say whether or not they had a permit or license. My guess is no because if you've driven the area where this occurred you'd know there are medians on and off along that stretch of road.

We went to the hospital to get checked out as well as the two other passengers who weren't at fault and in much worse condition. Our insurance is taking care of things right now, but will our premium go up if they didn't have insurance? Will their parents insurance cover it? If it's a stolen vehicle will the vehicle owner's insurance cover it?

The underaged daughter of my last guests took the bottle of wine and more liquor from the cabinet and got serious alcohol poisoning. Dad is threatening to sue. Am I in danger? (SC),"Hey all, I’ve got a bit of a weird one.

So, I own a condo in South Carolina that I like to AirBnB for some extra income when it’s not being used. Recently, I rented the condo out to a family of 3. Dad and mom were around 45 and daughter was 18. 

As a kind gesture, I typically get the cleaning people to set out a bottle of wine with a note for the incoming guests. In 2+ years of doing this, I’ve never had a problem with doing so. Until now. 

I got a call from the dad, infuriated, 2 nights ago. The dad told me that his daughter took the wine from off the bed and took liquor out of my hidden liquor cabinet to drink with friends. Turns out she doesn’t quite know her limits, and she about drank herself into a coma. 

Daughter had to take a trip to the hospital where she had her stomach pumped and was treated for other complications from the alcohol. 

So dad tells me on the phone that he would like compensation from ME for the medical bills from his daughters mistakes. He stated that I was responsible for it by putting out alcohol. He said that if I don’t agree to do so, he will sue me for it.

I think this claim is absurd. Yes, I put out alcohol, but I thought it was pretty understood that only people *of age* should be drinking it. I would’ve understood if the wine was left on the bed of the kids room, but it was on the kitchen counter with a note addressing the parents.

While I think the claims have no ground, the laws might disagree. I need to know: can I get in trouble for this? What do I need to do if so?",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/c94e48/i_own_a_condo_that_i_airbnb_out_when_im_not_using/,legaladvice,17275,201,0.0

pinkfloss9,2019-07-03 13:21:32+00:00,[MD] is it legal to charge more for babysitting special needs children?,"
This morning, I went to meet a client that that I’ve been talking to for a few days. The son was 8 years old. He was very quiet and was messily eating his breakfast. He didn’t speak a word to me and I thought he was very shy. 

The mom just told me that I would have to look after the house and feed him. And she told me the hours I had to work and I gave an hourly rate. She was doing a tour of everything and showed me his room. When I was in there I noticed a box of diapers in the corner, one diaper on the dresser and a box of wipes. I got a little concerned and asked her about it. I thought she would just say the diaper is only because of nightly bed wetting. Turns out her son has autism, he is not really verbal and not potty trained. I told her that I charge more when I have to give that much care. She got angry and said she was going to report me to the website. And that it’s illegal and discriminatory to charge her more for her sons disability. 

My usual rate is cheaper than most. I only do older children that I basically just have to be in the room with. I do homework and study for classes for majority of the time. I’ve only had like 4-5 special needs clients and they required more care so I charge more. The other parents were upfront about the child’s needs and what my duties were (diapers, hitting, spitting, bitting, cleanups, constant monitoring)  She never mentioned her son being special needs since we’ve been talking that’s why I told her the cheaper price.

She also threatened to report me to the board of nursing, even though I didn’t get hired as a CNA. I recently got my CNA, the only reason she even knows about it is because this morning as we were chatting over coffee, she had asked me about my life/college/nursing major. I just mentioned it.

I'm only three years late but wanted to update this post. 


I reached out to the IRS who, after several phone calls and hours on hold, told me nothing could be done and to just pay up. I called one more time and a much nicer agent told me more kindly that nothing could be done unless I could get my mother to admit to withdrawing the money in writing.


I told her that if she just told the truth, admitted it to me and the IRS and wrote the letter, I would forgive her and we could put it behind us. She refused. I told her to not contact me again until she was ready to stop blaming others and admit what she had done.


A few (blissfully calm) weeks later she called me and apologized. She wrote a handwritten letter stating she withdrew the money without my knowledge and none of the proceeds went towards my care. I wrote my own letter explaining that I was already an adult immigrating to another country at the time of the withdrawal, and attached a photocopy of my passport stamps, an affidavit that I had never lived at the address the cheque was sent to, and the receipt of my immigration application which was dated prior to the withdrawal. I asked that the tax liability be transferred to my mother and included her SS number which she signed off on.


The IRS sent me a letter back stating that the taxes owing would be issued under my mother's name. Because she was a jobless crack addict, her income was under the federal threshold and she did not need to pay anything due to how low her income was that year. Disaster averted.


For those curious, no, I never got the money back and decided not to pursue it. I didn't know it existed before the IRS contacted me, and didn't feel it was in anyone's best interest to force the issue knowing that I'd never get repaid anyways. Mom quit crack a year or two back, but still battles her demons in the form of alcoholism. Our relationship has slightly improved. Also, I'm a woman (most comments assumed I was male).

Now I’m getting letters about owing $2900 on a credit card.,"Back in February, the apartment complex where I live had an office break-in. At the time were assured that nothing of value was stolen and we had nothing to worry about. Last week, I got a letter from a collection agency stating I owed them around $2900 on a credit card I’ve never had. The account address returns to Florida, it’s obviously not me. Checked my credit, sure enough about 3 weeks after the break-in the account was opened.

According to one of the managers, applications for around 300 people were stolen. Some were former tenants and people just applying, but along with it all the current tenants had their information stolen as well. The only reason I know about this is because there are at least 3 other people in this complex who have received letters from the same collection agency over the past couple of weeks. One of them put two and two together and figured the office probably wasn’t telling the whole truth about the break-in. He went to the police department and received a copy of the police report through FOIA and it turns out all of our applications were kept in an unlocked file cabinet in the break room.

legalhelp9876,2019-07-01 18:26:15+00:00,My dog attacked an intruder,"I have a 4 year old German shepherd. She’s trained. She’s a sweet dog but she can get very anxious around strangers. But she won’t just attack someone randomly unless they’re a danger, like the person who tried to rob my house. 

I’ve owned my house for 2 years now. I live alone. I brought my dog with me from my apartment before this. Yesterday while I was at an overnight shift, someone broke into my house. I have an overnight shift once a week, every Sunday. So I’m not sure if the intruder watched me and figured out my schedule or if this was random. 

Kind of NSFW part here: 

I came home around 5:40am and the first thing I saw was blood on my living room carpet, and some on my tile floor in my kitchen. My dog came to me barking like crazy with blood around her mouth. Turns out the intruder tried to steal my TV, laptop, PS4, iPad Pro, and about $120 in cash which I can’t find anywhere. My laptop was damaged during this encounter. It’s valued at about $900, plus the missing $120. I think maybe he dropped it while trying to get out of the window. I’m not sure exactly yet but my work is gone now, so I could have issues with my job as well. 

My dog ripped a pretty big piece of the intruders calf off. He also had a large bite on his wrist/forearm. I’m pretty sure she grabbed him by the calf/leg and pulled when he was trying to get away. I’m not sure what else happened, considering the blood all over, but my dog wasn’t injured and the intruder was passed out. Maybe from the pain or something else that I don’t know. The intruder didn’t have a weapon. 

I called the police and an ambulance. The intruder is currently in the hospital and has to get surgery on his leg. That’s all I know, except that the police are questioning me about my dog. I have no idea what the intruder has claimed. I haven’t answered anything yet, they expect me to come in to office later today. 

But they’ve asked me if my dog has a history of violence, if I trained her to attack, etc. I’m worried that they’ll try to put her down. I don’t see how this could be her fault, she was protecting our home from an intruder. 

What should I do? Will my dog be put down? How can I protect her and myself over this? Did I do anything wrong so far? What can I expect to happen?

Not_That_Cold,2019-06-29 23:42:14+00:00,"My company tells customers food is transported below a certain temp, but I know it is not","Arkansas, US

This has been an issue for over a year now. My company, a large international fast food company (I'm trying not to be too specific) has a document on its website that tells customers that food is transported at or below a certain temperature to maintain food qualify and safety. Internal documents tell me not to accept a food delivery if it is above this temperature. My district manager, however, told me to ignore this policy. If it was off by just a couple degrees that would be one thing, but food has been arriving upwards of 20-30 degrees above this temperature. At my boss' insistence, I've accepted food that is definitely a health code violation in Arkansas -- ""food that is labeled as frozen... Shall be received frozen"" -- it's not been arriving frozen. I've tried escalating this though internal corporate means, but I was told by my manager that my district manager would not let me be promoted if I don't drop it. I can't drop it. 

When I told our distributor what temperature I could accept, he said ""my truck doesn't even get that cold."" They deliver to several locations in the state so I know they also are not getting food in temp. I think this is why I was told to drop it; it's too big of an issue so a major pain to address. 

I know I'm just a small fry in this company, but I'm trying to find some sort of law I can show corporate to get this fixed. Since the temperature is on a document available on the company website, would that be considered advertising/false advertising? I've also found a law regarding deceptive trade practices:

&gt;Title 4 - Business and Commercial Law
Subtitle 7 - Consumer Protection
Chapter 88 - Deceptive Trade Practices
Subchapter 1 - General Provisions
§ 4-88-107 - Deceptive and unconscionable trade practices generally.

My question is, would this be considered a false representation of source, perhaps? I'm looking for anything to grease the wheels of this major corporation to get this fixed because frankly I think the food gets nasty.

While there, they paid to take an hour and a half jet ski tour. While on this tour, the tour guide sped through and it ended up only being a 50 minute tour. She told the tour guide about their displeasure with the tour, speeding through and not being able to see as they sped through, and the tour guide was very rude and dismissed them. My mom took to Trip Advisor, Yelp, and Google to leave a negative review about their experience with the tour company. The next day they were charged $750 by the company, my mother called, and was told by the owner that they were charged the $750 due to leaving negative reviews which was slandering their company and then proceeded to hang up. 

Is there anything they can do? My parents reported it to their bank as fraud, the bank said it wasn’t considered fraud and that it was a dispute. The local police also were no help when called. 

Since this situation occurred, the company owner has used my mother’s Facebook pictures and shared them all over Facebook, with messages saying she was extremely drunk, and didn’t know what she was talking about. (If she was drunk why would you let someone on your jet skis? Is that not a liability? 🙄


My father then called, threatening a lawyer and the money was eventually refunded.

She started seeming lethargic on Thursday afternoon and progressively became less responsive throughout the day. We checked her temperature and it was 101.9, that’s when we decided to head to the ER. When we arrived, we checked in at the front desk. Within a few minutes they called us back through the double doors. We were greeted by an RN right inside the doors. He was immediately irritated and had a hostile tone of voice. He asked us what the problem was and we told him about her lethargy and fever. He didn’t take her out of the car seat or examine her. Just felt her hand and said, “her hand is cold, you need to cover her up with a blanket.” He then asked us if we had given her Tylenol, we hadn’t. Were first time parents and freaked when we saw the fever, went straight to the ER. He basically told us we were wasting his time and there’s only one doctor there so she probably won’t be seen and that we shouldn’t have brought her there without doing Tylenol at home. He told us we should go home and give her Tylenol, or head to the main hospital, but we’d probably be wasting our time because, “they’d start an IV and it would just traumatize her.” We went home and she seemed to get worse through the night but her fever temporarily came down. We decided to be at the front doors of our pediatrician when they opened. The pediatrician took one look at her and sent us to the main hospital. She asked us the name of the nurse and said that she was running that info up the chain of command. She called ahead for us so there were nurses waiting for us when we got to the main ER. As it turns out, she had a UTI that spread to her bloodstream resulting in sepsis. Her white blood cells were also elevated in her spinal fluid. The doctor told us we were lucky to catch it before it crossed into her fluid. We really thought that she wasn’t going to make it and have been completely distraught for days now. I’m beyond thankful that she’s doing much better now that she’s on antibiotics.

I have been renting a condo from the same company for almost 2 years, it's been fine. I recently started having an issue with the company allowing realtors to come and go as they please to show the unit, as it is up for sale. At first, they would show up unannounced, and sometimes they would not even knock before entering. I had a huge problem with this and made sure that my landlord knew that I'd like to be notified at least 24 hours before a realtor shows up. They agreed, but have found this very difficult to adhere to for some reason. This was sort of the beginning of the friction on our landlord/tenant relationship.

Recently, they sent a maintenance person over, unannounced (came home to find him standing in my kitchen) to fix a leak in the sink. I, nor either of my roommates, reported a leak in the sink.

I say please don't come today, because my pre-teen nephew is there and he would not be comfortable with a stranger in the house. I get no reply. Next thing I know, I find out that they have gone anyway and cut the deadbolt off of the door to enter the unit. The work order that the maintenance person had listed that my unit has no tenant.

Celany,2019-06-24 00:38:36+00:00,"(Brooklyn, NY) At what point to a contact the police/a lawyer about the mystery sack found buried under my back yard.","This is not a joke. I have pics to show the mods, if they so desire.

&amp;#x200B;

2 years ago, my partner and I bought a townhouse in Brooklyn. We ignored the back yard the first summer - too much going on inside. This summer, we have started trying to clear it out, which is a real challenge. My home was previously a 3/4 way home (between a half way home and full independence for substance abusers) and the back yard was/is littered with needles, broken pipes, other drug paraphernalia, marbles (no idea), and a shitton of broken glass, mostly beer and liquor bottles. I spend a few hours each weekend day carefully eliminating the weeds, then digging into the ground for a few inches with a spade and a hand rake, carefully sifting through the soil, picking out broken glass and the larger rocks. We have previously found random chunks of concrete, as well as broken bricks, unbroken bricks and cored concrete blocks.

&amp;#x200B;

Today I was digging and found a rock that felt fairly big, so I dug under it a bit with my spade, then got my shovel out, so I could level the rock upwards and see if I could lift it myself or leave it for my husband. It ended up being about a 1'x1'x4"" slab of what I would guess is ripped up vintage hexogonal bathroom tile, set on a concrete matrix. An interesting find, but also irritating - we have so much rando construction garbage in our yard to get rid of. 

&amp;#x200B;

Underneath, I discovered some more tiles that are potentially vintage - a seaform green and some other small chunks that just look old. Mixed with the tiles in the soil I found 3 alcohol bottles, empty, open, intact. 2 beer, 1 that looks to be liquor. Also mixed in were big enough chunks of broken glass that I currently estimate there were 2-3 other bottles mixed in. 

&amp;#x200B;

After digging up that, I hit some weird rock. It broke easily, was uneven in thickness, but overall, quite thing. At the thickest, it's maybe 3/4"". at the thinnest, 1/4"". It breaks easily, I dig it out. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am now about a foot below the surface, wondering how far I need to dig to get to the bottom of this refuse. 

&amp;#x200B;

Under the weird rock, there's a bit more soil, then I see something pink and soft. I brush it off. Imagine an ikea bag, but sturdier. That kind of plastic woven and sealed together. But pink. There's some kind of sack below this large slab and all the other things I find. I don't know how big it is, I've only uncovered about a 4"" square part of the top. I have no idea where the sides are, or how deep it goes. It seems to be fully and totally sealed still and I think would require a good knife to slice open. 

&amp;#x200B;

At this point, on a hunch, I go back to the weird ""rock"". I break some, and find that what I was beginning to suspect is true. This isn't rock. It's hardened tar. 

&amp;#x200B;

So buried in my yard is a pink sack (maybe once red and faded to pink) of unknown size, covered in soil, then covered in tar, then covered in soil mixed with empty booze bottles, then topped with a large slab of concrete flooring, then covered with several more inches of top soil.

&amp;#x200B;

My husband is working until 1:30am today, and once I realized that someone covered this sack with tar, I got freaked out enough to stop digging. I have no idea what is in that bag. I could be some previous family trolling us and making a weird time capsule. It could be someone's beloved deceased pet, I guess. Lastly, given this was a 3/4 way house that was run illegally and the man running it is now in jail, it could be all kinds of fucked up shit that I don't want to know about.

&amp;#x200B;

So, my questions:

&amp;#x200B;

1) Should we keep digging and open this sack on our own?

2) If now, lawyer first? or Police first?

3) If lawyer (not or later) what kind? 

4) What should I be aware of in dealing with the police? Is it safe to explain the circumstances at all, without a lawyer present? 

&amp;#x200B;

I took photos every step of the way, from the moment the medium-sized rock I thought I was digging out of the yard turned out to be a slab of what looks to be antique tile flooring. I shared these photos and the surprise with friends online, as it started out as a ""look at this kinda cool, but annoy shit I found in my yard today!"" thing, before it went into creepy wtf territory.

sanitystinks,2019-06-23 18:13:25+00:00,My ex died last night and her mother is blaming me and getting the police involved,"I live in Jacksonville, Florida, USA.  
My ex reached out to me last night via text, telling me her sugar was low and she needed help. I know she has Type 2 Diabetes, and when her sugar goes low she can't really think properly, this is the primary reason I'm scared of the potential liability.  
  
I thought this text was her just trying to guilt trip me again to come over and see her (she has a history of doing this, and I kept the texts.) So, I told her she needed to call 911 or her mother to help her out. She said she couldn't, that I was the only one who could help.  
  
This morning, her mom texts me telling me she passed away sometime last night. She goes on to tell me it's my fault since I was the last person she messaged and further, she is turning over the texts to the police because I didn't do anything to help my ex out. My initial thought was that there was something fishy and I went to drive by my ex's place to see if anything was going on, her mother's car was there, and so were several police vehicles. I didn't see any other, so I have no clue if this is all the truth, but it seems like a good possibility. Let the panic attacks ensue...  

So now, not only am I hurt over the loss, I'm also scared because I feel like it may be partially my fault and the police are going to come and ask me questions over her passing.  

I'm not sure how to handle this at all, any advice, beyond ""go see a therapist"", would be really appreciated, but some specific questions I have are:

* Can I be legally held responsible for her death?
* Should I reach out to an attorney?
* Should I reach out to the police?
* Is there anything, I can do to to stop her mom/family from sending me texts blaming me? (what I would consider harassing me about the situation)

It might be worth noting before questions are asked:  

* Yes, I have all the texts from last night.
* Yes, I have all previous texts from before showing her history of trying to get me to guilt trip me and manipulate me into doing things for her.
* Yes, I also have saved copies of them online in multiple places in case I need them later.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/c48v7d/my_ex_died_last_night_and_her_mother_is_blaming/,legaladvice,2530,254,0.0
Jenny86-75-309,2019-06-23 12:26:42+00:00,My ex proposed. I said no. He is now talking about suing me. Advice?,"Just want to say this is going to sound insane but I am not trolling/making it up.

Me and this guy were together for 3 years. We're 19 now. We never talked about the future until a year in. Before then I'd try to discuss it and he would change the subject.

In short, I wanted kids, he didn't. I wanted to stay in Ireland, he didn't. I wanted to get married, he didn't. When I realised it was a bad match I broke it off but he asked to get back together, saying we were too young to worry about the future, and we got back together. This happened a few times over the next 18 months In this time we probably spent more time apart than together.

We knew early on that we wanted different things, and while marriage and kids are something I would want further down the line, I wasn't concerned about his open dislike of marriage and kids because 19 is too young to get married anyway. If I were dating him 10 or 15 years from now and he didn't want to get married, then I might have an issue, but when I'm barely out of my teens, it's not a huge concern, and just loving him and wanting to be with him is enough.

When I went to see him this time I was again, considering breaking up with him. Aside from the long term issues, he is also inconsiderate and has a mean streak that I really don't like. So when I arrived at his place, mentally debating breaking up with him for good this time, and he told me he wanted to take me out to dinner, I assumed he wanted to break up too, publicly so I wouldn't cause a scene. I don't normally cause a scene but being in public tends to prevent yelling, and we both yell every time we break up.

In the last year he has asked me 2 things that looking back now stand out to me. First he asked about jewellery, what kind of stuff I liked and what my taste was. I assumed it was because my birthday was coming up and he was getting me a bracelet or something so I told him simple and delicate, silver or steel rather than gold, if there was a colour then blue, nothing flashy or expensive as both my job prefers plain jewellery and it's just my personal preference. I also said ""go cheap"". 

The other thing he asked me was how I felt about public proposals. I told him immediately that I, personally, disliked them as I felt I wouldn't be able to say no, even if I wanted to. I feel like public proposals are OK when they've been specifically requested and agreed on, but one that's totally out of the blue is not OK at all. I assumed he was asking about this because his friend had just proposed to his girlfriend of several years, publicly, and she'd accepted but admitted to him after that she would have preferred something private.

I never thought in a million years that he would propose.

So you can imagine my shock when we went to dinner and the first thing he did was propose. 

The ring was huge, gold, gaudy, red gems around a diamond and the whole thing was the size and shape of a super bowl ring. He got on one knee, and held it out to me. We were in the middle of this popular restaurant and the place was packed. Everyone there could see what was going on and wasn't even trying to hide that they were looking at us.

I said no.

Well, I didn't so much say ""no"". I ran out of the restaurant.

He drove me there, so I got a cab back, and drove home that night.

I just want to take the opportunity to say here that I really really don't care about the rings. Honestly, when I want to get married (which is absolutely not when I'm 19 years old) the right person could just turn to me and say ""wanna get married?"" and I'd say yes. I wouldn't even need a ring. I know I'm focusing on the ring and the public proposal a lot, but that's only because of 1) how far away it was from what I'd told him my taste was and 2) what happened next. 

I didn't hear from him until a few weeks later. He said that he thought a proposal was something I'd want, but he saw now that it wasn't. He said that he was out of pocket for the rings. He'd bought us both the same one and gotten them engraved. He linked me to the jeweller's website and the ring was up for €1450 (about $1650/£1300). When I asked why he was telling me this he said that he'd hoped I would cover the cost of mine. He said that as they'd been engraved he couldn't get a refund. He'd hoped that I would say yes to the proposal, in which case he wouldn't have asked me to pay, but I said no. He also said I'd embarrassed him by saying no in public, and should have said yes, and if I was really against it waited to say no when we were alone.

We both live in small towns where gossip spreads at church. Enough people were at the restaurant that night that both of us got asked about it at church on Sunday.

He has since messaged me saying he's debating calling in a lawyer to sue me for the cost of my ring (€1450) and he also says that I have caused him ""emotional distress"" by turning him down in public, and have publicly humiliated him for both rejecting his proposal in public and leaving him to deal with church gossip, which I had no part in spreading. He says he can also get some money off me over those other 2 things. So €1450 for what he spent on my ring, and extra money for emotional distress and public humiliation.

I think his legal claims are all bullshit, and he wouldn't have a leg to stand on in a court of law, but I am not a law student or a lawyer. He is studying law currently and has an internship at a legal firm.

What do I do about all of this? Do I need to prepare myself for a lawsuit or is it not even worth worrying about?

I am the only child, there is no one else. I found out today that Becky had to pay $300 to get the house in her name. I didn't even realize this was possible. Becky has mountains of debt even with my mom's checks she cashes each month along with her own disability check of around $1,000/month, Becky has always been in debt and has lived like this for a couple of decades. This is Kansas which is super cheap as far as taxes and cost of living. She always has excuses for where the money goes each month. I can't keep track of her terrible spending month after month. And Becky gets super angry and defensive whenever I approach the subject. I have a feeling that when my mom eventually dies, Becky won't want to leave the house. Or she will leave and pocket the entire money from the sale of the house. I'm sure she will have some sob story or excuse for why she needs it. She is already talking about getting multiple storage facilities for her piles of crap. I'm not sure what to do or if there is anything I can do. If anyone has an idea of where I could start I would appreciate it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/c3wp0j/my_mother_is_on_her_deathbed_i_am_her_only_child/,legaladvice,7221,70,0.0

&amp;#x200B;

A couple of hours ago the guy came by in person and apologized before anyone had time to send him anything. I'll spare you all the details, but he's going through some horrible stuff right now, and was lashing out in frustration trying to control one aspect of his life. No one and nothing made him change his mind, no one confronted him or sent a letter, he just realized he wasn't acting like himself. He was very sincere, said he was so embarrassed, and hoped that if he managed to get renters at any price he hopes that we would all treat them well regardless of his behavior. That's not going to be a problem and in our group text it sounds like he made rounds all up and down the street, and most people are inclined towards sympathy and forgiveness. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just wanted to update you guys because we were really freaking out and everyone calmed down a lot upon seeing the thread and realizing we wouldn't need to move or hire a lawyer or refurbish. I'm going to call my landlord now to make sure he knows the guy is okay and the issue is resolved.

Today they were forcefully removed from the property by the police. Our lawyer was somehow able to get a judge to look at everything and approve having them removed. The police officer basically told us to not move in and have the entire house professionally cleaned, as there is a bunch of needles and other things laying around.

On top of all that it seems they tried to seemingly destroy everything in our house. All the new appliances that came with our house are basically ruined, all toilets, and bathtubs seemingly look like they have been smashed with a hammer. In some places it looks like someone tried to rip the fucking wiring out of our walls, etc. Basically our house I guess basically as a final fuck you to us.

Our lawyer has basically told us the odds of us getting anything of value out of them is basically nil. I wanted them to go to jail for breaking and entering but apparently it doesn't work like that.

I posted this 2 weeks ago and a lot has happened. Something happened before I could go any further with the lawyer I spoke to.

The Monday following the incident I was asked to come speak with a VP of HR I'd never met and only knew by name, because they work directly for the company that bought ours out. When I walked in the conference room there were 4 people waiting for me, 2 of which I was told was part of legal. What I didn't realize, is my friend who I mentioned in the comments of the other post ended up saying something to another coworker because he was so horrified at the situation (even though I told him to keep it secret). This information ended up making it's way up the chain and was not taken well, to say the least. I was asked to explain exactly what happened, who I told, and asked a lot of questions. Everything I said seemed to make them very uncomfortable, especially when I told them I was in touch with a lawyer. They had me leave the room for nearly 40 minutes and then called me back in and let me know they were very concerned about this situation, and assured me it was an isolated power trip basically....  

This is the holy shit part. They say that due to my long tenure in my position, knowledge of how the team works, and my relationship with clients that they felt I would be a good fit for the position the jerk manager sat in, and if I wanted the position it was mine, as their way of saying sorry. They also made sure to mention the large salary increase and bonuses this would come with. I took a couple minutes to think about it, and took the offer. BTW I'm not stupid, I know they did this so I wouldn't take any legal action against them, but I love my job and don't blame them for the actions of a 20something on a power trip. I also know it came down to he said/she said, and would've been a hard case to prove.

There's going to be a company-wide training on gender and interpersonal relations, and I finally have an office with a door I can actually close! I'm in the field a lot less now, so I guess the jerk got what he wanted, because now I don't interact face to face nearly as much as I used to.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/c3d14c/updatefired_for_being_fat/,legaladvice,23078,4,0.0

So you all might know that my boyfriends dad didn't want us filing an incident report with the police. He thought they'd just make things worse. Boyfriends dad knew the guy who owned the property and was renting out to crazy neighbor. Boyfriends dad calls property owner and PO personally comes to visit us at our home to let us know he spoke with the police and wanted them to bring crazy neighbor over to apologize. We didn't want that and said we only wanted to file a report so crazy neighbor wouldn't even be aware we'd filed the report. 

Property owner doesn't really seem to understand and heads off to talk to crazy neighbor. Bf and myself decide to walk to the police station which is just down the road and explain to them that we don't want them to make the guy apologize or bring him back onto our property. Crazy neighbor sees us walking and yells at us to join the conversation with him and the property owner. I try and be civil as I was when he came onto my property, put his finger in my chest and told me to fuck myself. Dude is still very crazy and I decide to leave. Property owner mentions the police and I say we didn't want them to make crazy neighbor apologize. Crazy neighbor gets riled up at the mention of police and now we're all headed to the station together. 
At the police station, crazy neighbor makes himself look ridiculously crazy by verbally attacking and mocking me and the police tell him to leave. They pull myself and my boyfriend aside and let us know if we need them again they're there for us. 
Today, we notice that crazy neighbor is moving out. Looks like he acted crazy enough in front of the guy who owns the property to get booted. I'm honestly super glad he's leaving because this whole situation was pretty stressful and I definitely didn't like having a crazy person living next door. 

Don't be a dick to your neighbors, guys.

I've already done everything I was ""supposed"" to do, like freeze my credit (though he just called and unfroze them, but that's a different story), rolled my bank accounts, filed a police report with a bunch of addendums with his activities every week, I got a lawyer and disputed all the accounts and inquiries he made, locked down my house and got a security cameras. That is already all done. 

Then today I got an email that looked like spam, some offering legal services for a court case that has my name on it. Lo and behold when I looked it up in my state's system, there I was, a co-defendant as part of a company I've never heard of, being brought to civil claims court for \~$35K over an unpaid car loan. It was filed 4 days ago. 

The other defendant seems to be the identity thief himself. His address is in the area where all the other identity theft stuff has been happening - fraudulent car loan applications, an IP from a site where he tried to order a bunch of shit in my name, etc. It has to do with cars which is what most of his other criminal activity has revolved around. He has a foreign name and he had bad english on the other applications he made in my name. I have a strong feeling this is the actual thief. 

The case itself - apparently he bought a car with credit, and stopped paying it almost a year ago. The loan company is bringing him to court for the unpaid balance of $35K. The filing claims that a tow company, owned by My Name, towed it and is in possession of it and will not give it back. 

I drove by this address and it's a personal residents with some cars hidden in the back, but none of them look like the car in question, though I didn't get a close enough look. 

I have NO idea what to do right now. Surely I am not liable for this? What do I do? Can I call my state's state department and tell them that the business was made fraudulently, and have it closed?

PhunkyPterodactyl,2019-06-17 20:50:03+00:00,My abuser is changing their legal name. Is there anything I can do to stop this?," Hello,

This is my first time posting here, and it’s on a throwaway account for my own safety.

I’m a survivor of domestic violence. I was treated like a prisoner in my own home. I have lived through verbal, physical, emotional, technological, financial, and psychological at their hands. It took me many months of planning to safely escape and obtain a restraining order against them. Even with the order and after being enrolled in my state’s confidentiality program (I live in Pennsylvania) I’m still terrified of them. 

When I obtained the restraining order in court, they completely denied everything that had happened. There was no guilt. No remorse. He instead went on a tirade in court about the ramifications of having a PFA order filed against him. He is (or at least was at the time) teaching part time at one of the local universities and is a successful realtor.  He kept stating that a PFA would ruin his career and reputation. He was so successful and well-liked.... He would constantly tell me that no one would ever believe me and that he would sue me if I reached out to anyone about the abuse. The judge granted the restraining order against him in the end. I was fortunate enough to have quite a lot of evidence regarding the abuse.  I’ve been rebuilding my life and trying to recover since then.

He is now petitioning to change his legal name. I imagine he’s likely doing this to prevent others from finding out about the restraining order since it can be easily found on our county’s department of court records site. I had also unfortunately found out way too late that he was also in a massive amount of unpaid debt to many creditors and landlords. I imagine that they’ve taken this into consideration as well.

It’s terrifying for me to think that someone else might become their next victim. I understand that it’s not my responsibility to protect someone else and I want to move on, but I’m scared that someone else could miss out on finding his records. I’m scared that someone else will get hurt.

From what I understand, there’s supposed to be a public hearing regarding the name change. I want to speak out,  but I’m terrified of them. Seeing them in court previously was traumatic. 

Is there anything else that I can do? Will the judge take the restraining order and the unpaid debt into consideration when it comes time for them to make there decision regarding the name change? 

TLDR: Abuser in Pennsylvania is petitioning to change their last name. They have a restraining order against them and a myriad of civil judgements for unpaid debt from creditors and landlords. Will the judge take this into consideration? Is there anything I can do?

drfsupercenter,2019-06-17 06:13:13+00:00,[Chicago] I was robbed by my AirBnB host. Looking for legal advice.,"This all took place over the past weekend (Friday/Saturday, June 14-15) in Chicago.  I already filed a police report, as well as brought this to the attention of AirBnB both over the phone and on Twitter.

Unlike my posts about this incident elsewhere, I'll be as thorough in explaining the situation here as to get the most relevant advice possible.  I apologize in advance for the essay, but please read all of of it if you want to give advice, to make sure you get the whole story.

I was in Chicago for the weekend for Pokémon Go Fest - for those unfamiliar, it's an all-day paid event hosted at a park, this year it was at Grant Park.  My ticket date was for Friday the 14th.

Earlier that week (Monday I think?) I went on Airbnb to look for affordable options.  By this point, all the hotels in the area were close to $300 a night, and most Airbnb's within a mile or two of Grant Park were either already booked or also that expensive.  I found what looked to be a good deal south of downtown for around $85 a night.  The host had mostly positive reviews, with the only negative review saying that he felt the price was too high for a single bed.  Fine, nothing to really be concerned about there.  People said the host was nice, that he made them breakfast, really no reason to think there was anything fishy going on.

I requested Thursday through Sunday (checkout on Sunday) through Airbnb, and the host accepted my request later that day.  I put in the comments (where it says to tell the host about yourself, and they encourage you to share why you are traveling) that I was in town for Pokémon Go Fest and would be gone most of the day, and just needed a place to sleep at night.  Arrived in Chicago, went to meet my host Thursday evening.  The Uber driver warned me that it wasn't the best place for an Airbnb and that it was one of the unsafer neighborhoods in Chicago.  Well OK, nice to know, but I really didn't have any options at this point.

Messaged the host that I was there, he came out to meet me and show me up to the room.  I took all of my belongings with me (I had a laptop worth about $2000, a suitcase with my Nintendo Switch among other things, phone chargers, clothes, medication), and said I would be back later, that I wanted to go get some dinner.  I asked him if there was a key for the place he could give me (as that's usually what Airbnb hosts have done at past trips I've taken, even if it *is* just for a single room and not the entire place), and he said he doesn't have a spare key, but to just message him when I need to be let in and he'll come open the door.  Again, he seemed friendly so I didn't think anything of it, and said I would be back later.

I got back, messaged him to let me in, and he came to open the door.  I went to bed, didn't talk to the guy at all.  He had the TV on all night, or at least until I fell asleep, I was lying in bed at 1:30am hearing his TV.

Next morning (Friday), I got up, showered, took my medication and left.  After all, that was the day of Go Fest, where I would be busy in the park from 9am-7pm.  The host knew this, I told him in my initial request to book that I would be gone all day.

So here I am in Grant Park at about 9:30, after just getting started with my day, when I got a message from Airbnb support.  They told me ""your host is no longer able to accommodate you, let me know when I can call and discuss this with you.""   Already pretty pissed off at this point as I was trying to enjoy my day, but I told them go ahead and call whenever.  I got a call from a ""resolution manager"" maybe 15 minutes after I sent that message, and the lady explained that, for whatever reason, the host was no longer able to host me and that, as compensation, they would give me a $200 voucher and give me links to other listings in the area.  Great, I said, but what about all of my stuff?  I'm *busy all day*, I can't just go get my suitcase and laptop, having nowhere to take the stuff, nor can I check into some Airbnb at 9:30 in the morning.  The lady said she'd check, and call me back.  She called back another 10-15 minutes later and said ""I talked to your host, he said he would be there all day so you can get your things when it's convenient."" I said great, then I won't leave the park and just go get my things after 7pm when the event is done.  I asked the lady if he gave a reason for cancelling my trip (at this time, I was too preoccupied to even ask *if he had a right to do this*, I just went along with it), and she said that he said something about ""not liking the communication"", whatever that means.  Um, okay.

Fast-forward to 12:30pm.  Host messages me through Airbnb (note that, the entire weekend I hadn't ever talked to the host outside of Airbnb - I had his number and he had mine, but I didn't receive any text messages from him or any calls, and I didn't message/call him either.  Given that the whole ""I don't have a key for you"" was already sketchy enough, I wanted all of my communications with him to be logged through Airbnb so their staff could see it in case of incident.) saying ""Your checkout time was noon and you didn't come to get your stuff.  I'm going to put it under the stairs."" I wrote back saying that Airbnb support told me you would be home all day, what are you talking about? My checkout time was noon *ON SUNDAY*, not in the middle of the day on Friday!  If he wanted to cut my trip short, that was on him, but he's not going to inconvenience me like this.  (okay, I didn't say all of that to him, just the first part about what support told me).  He wrote back saying ""I don't know what you two talked about but I definitely will not be home all day, I suggest you come get your stuff.""

Well, considering that the front door to the building locks, I figured my stuff was safe under the stairs, only tenants of that building would be getting in anyway, and if he wasn't home later I could probably ask one of the other tenants to open the door for me.

So around 6pm when I had a bit of a break, I looked for another Airbnb.  Found something much closer that cost more money, since they were giving me a $200 voucher after all - tried to book one, but the voucher wasn't working.  I called them and they said they'd ""look into it"", and I basically said look, I'm running out of time, just give me $200 back to my credit card and I'll get a hotel, I'm done dealing with you guys.  They agreed, under the condition that I gave them the hotel receipt.  So I booked a hotel.

Fast-forward to Friday night around 8:30pm.  Finished Go Fest, ate dinner, got an Uber over to the place.  I actually told the Uber driver I was going to get my stuff, and then need a ride to the hotel, he said he can just add a destination to our trip, and agreed to wait while I got my stuff.  The front door to the complex was locked, but the night before it had opened after I jiggled the knob a few times.  I'm standing there jiggling the knob and trying to push the door in when some lady gets out of her car with a young child.  She sees the Uber driver parked there watching me, asks him what's going on, he explains to her that he's waiting on me, etc etc.  This lady's naturally a bit spooked, as she sees some strange guy trying to, what looks like, break into her apartment building while someone in a car is waiting for them.  Definitely seems sketchy from her perspective.  I explain the situation to her and she's shocked that anyone would rent an Airbnb in that building, but she agrees to open the door for me.  I get in, look under the stairs, and my luggage isn't there.  Wanting answers immediately, I attempt to actually call my (former) host.  He doesn't answer.  She said she'd try to call since she lives across from him, I gave her the number - she calls, gets his voicemail, leaves a message.  Oh, and meanwhile the Uber driver alerted me that someone else was added to his queue so he has to leave.  I say thanks for the ride and that I'll book another when I'm ready.  Now I'm by myself. 
 While we're waiting for a call back, I walk up to her apartment (which is directly across from his) - as she handed me a couple gallons of milk to carry for her while she unlocked the door for me.  I set the milk down in her apartment and, just for the heck of it, I open the Tile app on my phone.

Before I continue my story, let me explain real quickly what Tile is and what it does.  Tile is a small tracking device that you can attach to objects that you think you might misplace - in my case, my car keys and wallet.  I have one in my wallet and one on my key ring.  If your phone is within Bluetooth range of these devices, you can make them play music to help you find the device - and if you ever lose it, the app will tell you where it's last seen.

So, anyway - much to my surprise, the Tile app tells me *that my keyring is in range right now*!  Literally, as I'm standing outside the guy's apartment that I can't get into, my car keys (which were in my luggage) are within a few hundred feet of my phone!  The guy calls her back and says ""look, I told the guest this too, I put his stuff under the stairs, if it's gone then someone probably stole it and it's his fault for not coming and getting it when I told him to."" She relays the message to me, but I say no... that's not true, the stuff is here *right now*, and I show her my phone.  She tells him this, and I hear loud yelling over the phone.  He starts cussing her out, saying it's none of her [expletive] business, and hangs up.  Okay, now I'm starting to get the picture.  He probably saw this as a great opportunity - I said in my notes that I would be gone all day for an event, he sees that I have valuable items, what a great idea!  He can end my stay early, *know I can't get my stuff because I'm gone at an event*, CLAIM he put it out for me and ""oh, it's gone, someone must have stolen it"".  Meanwhile, he pockets all this valuable loot that he can do whatever with.  Except... he wasn't planning on me being able to prove that my belongings were in his apartment that night when he wasn't home.  As soon as she tells him this, he flips out, realizing I'm onto him.  The lady calls the landlord.  Landlord comes out, I explain this all to him.  He advises me to file a police report.  Says that even though he has the key and *can* let me enter his apartment, he doesn't have the legal right to do so, and that the tenant (my Airbnb host) could try to sue *him* for illegal entry.  The landlord also puts a notice on the guy's door, saying he's going to evict him, that it's totally against his lease to let guests stay there.  He was appalled that the place was even listed on Airbnb.

We called the police, waited about half an hour for them to show up, making small talk in the meantime.  He told me he was gonna evict the guy soon anyway because of how shady he is, and that this whole Airbnb thing suddenly makes sense, because the guy was always late paying the rent and kept coming up short, but that mysteriously a couple months ago he was able to pay it (after the landlord threatened to evict).  I keep telling the guy, look, that's all well and dandy but I just want my stuff back.  I do understand where he's coming from, and that's why I was glad to wait for the police.  If police can write up a warrant and let me in, great!  But after about half an hour of waiting, he said ""let's just go down to the station"" so he drives me there.

I run this by them, the cops basically say they can't issue a warrant off of that alone and that I have to attempt to get my stuff back directly from the person first, then I can file a report if he doesn't comply, *then* they can do something.  So the landlord tells me - the guy's usually home Saturday mornings.  Call him, call the police, they'll go up together and see what they can do.

So I'm staying completely empty handed at a hotel Friday night, hoping I can resolve this matter in the morning.

Saturday morning comes, I do exactly as instructed.  Call landlord, call police.  Police escorts come out, landlord comes out a bit later.  I call the host, who of course does not answer, so landlord gets his spare key and we start walking up to the place - me, landlord, and an officer.  Knock on the door, no reply.  Police knocks and says they're the cops, here with landlord and guest, the man opens the door ajar (leaving it chained so they couldn't force entry), starts filming and making this whole spiel about illegal entry and how they're infringing his rights.  He says to me ""I messaged you lots of times and you ignored me"", I say no you didn't, I don't have a single text from you and only the one message from Airbnb and he says ""that's bulls*** and you know it"".  I say fine, show me your phone then where you sent me texts, and of course he refuses because that's not true at all.  The cop basically says look, at this point you tried, but you'll have to file a report for stolen belongings, we can't break into this guy's place.  Meanwhile, I'm checking my phone while standing in front of his apartment like the night before, and the Tile shows it's no longer there.  Says it was last seen 10:30pm Friday night (when we left to wait on the cops).

So, the guy moved my stuff elsewhere after realizing we were onto him, also took the notice off his door.  The landlord gave me all the information I needed to file my police report, and asked if he could see the Airbnb listing just to see what I even agreed to with the guy.

Would it shock anyone at this point when I learned that he used a fake name on Airbnb?  The name I had for him wasn't even his real name.  Huge surprise. /s

So anyway, I give the officer all this info, they write up a report.  I give them the itemized list of what was stolen, they estimate it at around $3000 (I actually forgot to tell them about my Switch at this point), give me a ""victim notice"" and say an investigator will follow up with me in a week or so.  Well, great, I won't even be there in a week, and he can easily sell my stuff before any of those serials I gave the cops get registered anywhere!

I called Airbnb about this.  I said first of all, I didn't think hosts could just cancel a stay like that and kick a guest out.  They said ""they can't..."" and the guy on the phone said ""your stay wasn't cancelled at all, it shows a confirmed reservation from June 13-14 with you checking out on the 14th at noon."" I said NO, that's not it, look at my original confirmation.  He checks and says ""oh, huh, I see that now."" Digs into it and apparently some supervisor overrode something that should not have been overridden, as it shows in the Airbnb app that I consented to the altered stay (I did not, and was simply *told*).  I don't know what lies he told the Airbnb support people, but they somehow got their managers to override this and alter my trip to say I was checking out on the 14th instead of the 16th.

So at this point I'm considering my goods lost, and I called Airbnb again and asked if there was any way they can take money from the guy (after all, if they deposit money into his bank account when people book stays with him, they can take it out too...) to reimburse me the $3000 he stole from me.  They said ""you can do that, but you have to fill out a request"" and they sent me a link.  The link only lets me request $87 back (one nights' stay, the other two were auto-refunded when the trip was altered).  I explain this to them, and they said ""just request the $87 back, the guy's not going to do it anyway, then after 72 hours you can escalate it to our claims division and they can go from there."" Needless to say I'm less than pleased with Airbnb's support by now, I've talked to several different ""case resolution managers"" who all just keep giving me links to things within the app, and none of them assuring me they will ban the guy from Airbnb for being a fraud and stealing from his guests.

I sent the guy a message through Airbnb saying, just FYI I gave the police all the serial numbers of what you stole, and I have GPS tracking on my items should you try to sell them (the second part isn't entirely true, since Tile requires a phone to be in-range of it to actually get the location.  Since Friday night it hasn't been picked up by any phones.  But he's not going to know that!) I said I'd be willing to drop the police report and Airbnb claim I filed against him if he returns my stuff (again, not true, I'm absolutely still keeping that police report open) No reply of course, so I text him the same message.  Still no reply.

Sunday morning I figure what the heck, I'll try one last time.  I said something along the lines of ""If you don't return my belongings, I will sue you for at least $3000 which is the value of the items you stole from me.""  Short and sweet.  He messaged back ""I filed a police report against you for phone harassment, don't contact me again""

I called the non-emergency police number and explained this all to them.  The lady said his supposed police report was complete bogus and that sending two messages asking for my stolen items back is absolutely not harassment, that it wouldn't hold up in court at all.  But either way, it's clear he's not going to return my stuff.

I'm now back in Michigan without any of my belongings.  The guy's probably going to try to sell my stuff.  He's also probably being evicted from his apartment but that doesn't help me in the slightest.

Airbnb is still ""working on the case and will contact you as soon as we can"", and I'm not expecting to hear anything from the police investigator for a week.

The lady at the police did say I can hire a lawyer in Michigan to sue the man in Chicago and not have to actually travel back to Chicago myself.  Though I'm not sure I'd trust that, I want to testify against the guy myself.

However, I've also never taken anyone to court before.  Only times I've ever been to court were for jury duty and to contest traffic tickets.  Hence why I'm asking for advice.  What can I really do at this point?  I've Googled the subject and most people are saying Airbnb just tells people to sue in incidents like this, they aren't a hotel and their insurance is to protect *hosts* from unruly *guests* and not vice-versa.  So I'm really not thinking they'll do anything either, and the guy's listings are still up as well.  Half tempted to hire someone else to book the place and go looking for my stuff, lol.

But seriously, what should I do?  Just sit and wait?  Hire a lawyer? Any advice is really appreciated.

tl;dr Airbnb host who knew I would be gone and unable to come for my belongings bent rules and ended my stay early, kept all my items in his apartment and lied to me saying he left them out for me to collect.  Tried to play it off as someone else stealing them, freaked when I confronted him on the lie and now refuses to cooperate with police nor give my stuff back.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/c1k3wj/chicago_i_was_robbed_by_my_airbnb_host_looking/,legaladvice,5764,132,0.0

Scumbag_Locksmith,2019-06-15 15:06:51+00:00,Houseguest had a deadbolt installed after being reminded that he'll have to leave soon. Questions about the situation in general but specifically the locksmith's liability here. (Update),"TL;DR - things kind of managed to sort themselves out

So I got a call while I was getting ready to head back to the apartment to meet the locksmith. It was Pete's brother. Apologies for the lack of details here but I don't know too much about exactly what went down, and a chunk of what I do know is sort of personal shit that the brother, who just did me an enormous favor, probably wouldn't want me sharing. Anyway, the gist of the phone call was that he went by and performed a third party constructive eviction with the back of his hand. So Pete's gone, as is most of his stuff. His brother is going to swing by next week to grab any odds and ends that they may have missed. I am planning on making him dinner and hitting him off with a bottle of good whiskey when he does so.

As far as Pete goes, I'm thinking that I'll follow through with at least the early part of the eviction process just in case he tries anything cute. Gonna speak to my attorney about this first, but he's still in the wind. Turns out he's staying at a cabin his girlfriend's family owns and it's pretty much as close to being in the middle of nowhere as human-built structures get. His admin/paralegal... I dunno what she is specifically, but she said that yesterday was the one day he wasn't going into town for cell service. This gives us the opportunity to convince him that the situation is currently way worse than it ever was, and as much as I love this guy, he's really fun to fuck with so that's cool. 

After speaking with him I called the owner of the locksmith to let him know that the apartment was vacant, so his guy wouldn't need to show up with police. Turns out he was planning on coming by to handle this himself anyway, so that was easy enough. I met him over there, he had a handful of deadbolts for me to choose from, and he switched out the lock in about five minutes. We got to bullshitting about baseball because that's what you do in New York, and this led to him accepting my offer to buy him a beer so we could watch the White Sox smack our Yankees around. I got some backstory at the bar, and while this is secondhand information, the dude seems pretty reliable so I've got no reason not to believe him. 

The guy who came over yesterday morning was indeed an employee of his, but he wasn't on the clock and actually ""borrowed"" the deadbolt without mentioning anything. Turns out he is an old friend of Pete's, and had been fed a story about an insane landlord who had decided to move into the apartment Pete was renting. Brilliant. Anyway, my new locksmith buddy told me that this guy was officially unemployed as of that afternoon. I'd feel bad for the dude but I'm too busy not caring about what his motivation was due to the complete and total lack of any attempt to verify the story he'd been fed. This also explains the the non-answers I got when I called the shop - the person I spoke to was a manager who had absolutely no idea what I was talking about. He was basically trying to buy some time to speak with the owner and the guy who installed the deadbolt instead of just pulling an excuse out of his ass for me. I wish he'd told me that in the first place but I do appreciate the fact that he didn't just try to go into CYA mode for the company/his (now former) co-worker. All in all, I have a new preferred locksmith for when I need something done at any of my properties. 

So really the only legal shit left is the restraining order, and Pete very kindly sent my wife a few emails last night upon figuring out that she'd blocked his number. Not gonna go into detail but I'll just say that the contents should make the restraining order easy to get. 

So thank for all of the help and well wishes, but it seems like this is more or less a wrap, and a pretty amusing one too. My wife's gone from upset about the whole thing to uncharacteristically indignant, which she's admitted is kind of cathartic for her, so I don't even have a reason to feel guilty about laughing about what a moron Pete is!

He was heathy (actually just had a physical). Wednesday night he told his friends he wasn’t feeling well, (thought he had a fever) he took a shower and said he was feeling better, but he wanted to stay in for the night.
The next day his friend couldn’t get a hold of him so he had room service let him into my brothers room. They found him there in the floor he was gone. 
My family is devastated. His son was on a plane yesterday in the air heading down to DR to spend the weekend with his dad on vacation, only to get off the plane and find out his father was gone. We actually knew about his death before his son did as he was in the air when we found out. 

Something is happening down there. I don’t know if they are poisoning people or if it’s bad liqueur. 
I have found articles saying the FBI is investigating so I called and I can’t get anyone.
They instantly take me to a computer that wants me to choose which investigation I am calling about and the DR deaths are not one of them.
I called the embassy and got the run around. 
My nephew is still down there 
They are taking him to see his dad today.
We just need advice.
We are so lost.
We know we want to get an autopsy, but we don’t want it done down there by them.
Any advise or steps or numbers to call we would definitely appreciate it 

Also spoke with two news stations yesterday but no one has gotten back to me today.

We did a walk through and were given keys of the finished unit on Monday, and everything was fine. 

Today was our move in day, we showed up before the movers. Only to discover \~2 women sitting on blankets in our living room.  They got extremely defensive and claimed they paid to rent it, and i called the police. I walked around the back and the patio door looks like it was shattered. 

The police came and i I provided them with all the paperwork showing we are the owners. However he came back with a  ""Residential Tenancy Form"" that was apparently they both signed (half of it seemed to be blank). The kicker is that apparently their monthly rent is ""only"" $250/month. 

After about 2 hours of back and forth of this, the police officer gave us a report number and recommended we seek legal aid. However he cannot remove them from the premises until he is able to talk to the ""landlord"" who apparently no-one can get a hold of. 

After he left one of the women came up to my wife and basically told her they would leave for $15,000 no questions asked. I offered them $500 and she laughed at me.

He's lived here ten years. I've been here often for the past two. Never has there been a problem with the trash cans going up until recently -about two weeks ago- a new neighbor moved in and started putting his in our spot, leaving us nowhere to put ours. 

Today, I was taking up the trash and again the cans were in our spot. I just moved them over. There were too many cans and new recycling buckets, so I moved one of his cans to the other side of his driveway. NBD right? Wrong. 

My boyfriend and I go back to his house and decide we'd walk to the store. As we're coming out of the house we see this guy walking down our driveway. I say hello and he walks up to our porch and mentions his trash cans. I say that we moved them because they were in our space. He says our driveway is bigger than his and we should just take up part of our driveway with our cans so he can put his in our usual spot. I suggest that he put them on the other side of his driveway. He stops still, points at my chest and tells me to fuck myself. I'm a 22 year old woman and this guy is a bigger, much older man. I just stand there in shock and slightly amused. He walks down our driveway, gets about fifteen feet away,turns around and starts yelling ""fuck you, fuck yourself"" over and over as he leaves.

I was told by the lead detective that my case alone carries a life sentence. 

When I was in 5th grade, I told my principal about some physical abuse that was going on in my house. I told her how the night before, my mother was choking my brother who was 2 years younger than me, and how we were all genuinely terrified of her. My principal called the police, and we were brought to a “receiving home” (state facility for children in danger from their parents). We were told that we would be safe now and that she couldn’t hurt us anymore. This happened on a Friday. On that Sunday, only 2 days later, we were released back into her custody. As you can imagine, the physical and sexual abuse only got worse from there. 

My question is, do I reserve the right to sue Child Protective Services (CPS) in the state of California for ALLOWING the abuse to continue, and if so, what is the best way to go about this, and should I wait until after my mother’s trial?

alternatedstateOK13,2019-06-11 11:44:34+00:00,(OK) Mom passed away and things aren't adding up.,"I'm not really sure what to make of all this and I could really use some insight on the matter. Evidently my mom passed away last Wednesday June 5th...I say evidently because my brother and I weren't notified until yesterday evening of her passing. 

I'm not entirely clear on the details because the circumstances are not adding up and I'm afraid if I try and explain the chain of events... it'll become extremely confusing but I feel like the manner in which this was handled seems fishy.  

We first learned of the news from a friend of our mother's who says she recieved a phone call yesterday (4 days after my mother's passing) from someone claiming to be a sheriff of the county my mother resided in, informing her my mother had passed away and asked if she happened to have keys to my mother's house because they were trying to locate next of kin. (See...weird huh?) He claims he found her number by going through my mother's phone (which would've been with her in her house, where they found her so why do they need keys) She told them she did not have keys but they could try calling her children (me and my brother) or her brother (my uncle) and that our numbers should also be in the same phone. 

My mother's friend calls me to ask what was going on and did something happen to my mom and while I'm talking to her, my uncle calls me... which is odd because I haven't spoken to him in over 10 years and I wasn't even aware he had my number. He immediately goes into this whole story about how my mom passed away last Wednesday of a massive heart attack in her home and the police from her town contacted him after they were sent to her house to do a welfare check and found her. They supposedly went through her phone and saw he was the last person she talked to so they contacted him first. Then without skipping a beat or even giving me a chance to process all of this,  he goes on to tell me that my mother had informed him on multiple occasions that she was leaving everything to him and that he was to make sure my brother and I, were to receive none her belongings and he kept mentioning his good friend Sheriff Whats-his-nuts ( fake name for obvious reasons) and HIS attorney have both informed him he was not to contact my brother or me about the situation and that since my mother left him everything, he needed to remove what he wanted from her home and donate the rest to Salvation Army. He was making arrangements to have her cremated and would let me know if he decides to do a funeral... then he hung up.

How is that even possible? Can he do that? I mean even if by some crazy off the wall chance my mother lost her mind and created a legal living will that named her brother... who's almost 15 years older than my mother by the way... the executor of her will and she left everything she owns to him...is there not some kind of reading of the will my brother and I are required to attend? Is this how this stuff goes down? I really can't be involved in making funeral arrangements for my own mother? Never once had our mother ever mentioned she had a will and I can not fathom her leaving everything to my uncle. But my feelings aside what is the legal process here? How could I find out for certain if there even is a will? 

The situation gets a little crazier because after I called my brother, he calls my uncle and is told the same thing... they argue a little over the phone and it's now turned into my brother and I are allowed to accompany my uncle to my mother's house, and ""rummage through what's left to see if there's anything we want"" but it has to be this coming Wednesday because he has meetings all day Tuesday (today) with a probate attorney to iron out the details of my mother's estate. To my knowledge he's already taken her dog and her brand new car, into his possession. 

This makes me think there is no will. If there was a will like he originally claimed, and my brother and I were to receive nothing... how are we all of the sudden allowed to look through what's left?

I'm extremely uncomfortable with this situation. 

The most disturbing part of this whole ordeal is, I know my mother was working on the legal details of an invention she recently had patented and was in the process of interviewing manufacturers to fabricate her invention.  She reviewed all the legal paperwork with my brother and me a few months ago...I'm worried that's why my uncle is in such a hurry to hire a probate attorney, and throw names of law enforcement friends of his (he himself is a retired police officer) which would also explain why it took him 4 days to notify my brother and me about her passing. 

Isn't there some kind of chain of command that has to be followed when it comes to notifying next of kin? Is there a certain legal process that needs to happen when a person has a will?? Or even if they don't?? Sorry for the long post. I'm still trying to understand all of this. It just doesn't seem to make any sense. Who should I contact first? The police in her area? An attorney?

The gist is they gave us the pup for free on the condition we return her for six days of the year, every year, for breeding purposes. After 5 or 6 breeds, we're no longer required to do so. A contract was signed by both myself and a representation from the breeding agency. I dealt with a specific breeder but the contract is with the company, not an individual.

The company dissolved in January and our contract doesn't mention anything about this kind of scenario. It's a very rudimentary contract which only covered what we need to do, the agency's responsibility for the pups health, etc. It makes no mention of things like ""we reserve the right to take the puppy back"" or anything like that.

The individual breeder contacted me days ago asking for the puppy back, claiming we're only borrowing the dog and it's still her property. I argue the contract is with a nonexistent company and doesn't concern the breeder, so we're not comfortable speaking to her about it.

I am the only black person and the youngest by far. My other coworkers are white, asian and post-grad. I am the only one with hair like mine.

The only reason I got hired was because I speak french. We get a lot of french-speakers in our store for some reason, and I'm the only one able to assist them.

My manager sat me down for a serious talk. She basically told me I had to wear my hair straight or slick down into a bun. That they have an image to sell and standard to uphold, they can't do that if I'm 'running around the store looking like a teenager.'

I have curly hair so I normally do a half up, half down. But usually just leave it out because all my other coworkers don't tie their hair back either. I did slick it down into a bun during my interview. 

My manager sat me down for a serious talk. She basically told me I had to wear my hair straight or *at least* slick down into a bun. That they have an image to sell and standard to uphold, they can't do that if I'm 'running around the store looking like a teenager.'

I told her that I can't straighten my hair because it will seriously damage it and gelling it down everyday will make it break off.  She told me that I have to abide by the appearance guidelines or I'll get written up. 

I wish I did point out the double standards and hypocrisy. But in that moment I felt very small and didn't have the courage. When explaining what happened to a sibling and parent, they said I was being discriminated against and it's unacceptable. I don't know about HR or if we even have an HR in our store.

Am I being discriminated because of my race and age? Is hair protected? I don't know.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/byv7cs/my_manager_said_i_have_to_straighten_my_hair/,legaladvice,6597,125,0.0

I promised an update so here it is. First off, I want to thank everyone who strongly suggested I go see a doctor ASAP. I went to see an ENT and audiologist approximately a week and a half after the incident occurred. My hearing test came back normal, which was very reassuring. The tinnitus was still quite bad, so I wanted to see if the doc could help with that. He put me on a steroid cycle for a week and a half, which just ended yesterday. I saw him again a week after the first visit, and we decided to try a steroid injection directly into both ear drums. (This was a very unpleasant experience, as you can probably imagine)

The ringing has gone down considerably, and I'm hopeful it will eventually be completely gone. It still bothers me at night and while I'm trying to work sometimes. The biggest problem lately has been that these steroids cause insomnia, so I haven't gotten a good night's sleep in weeks. This has caused me to have to cancel a summer project, since at this point I'm far too behind schedule to complete it. 

My uncle has agreed to pay for all medical costs. I'm not planning on suing him. He knows he fucked up and was apparently crying on the phone when my parents called him to tell them what I was going through. My aunt has also had a really rough time since finding out the extent of the damage. I haven't talked to either one of them since it happened, and don't plan on talking to him any time soon. They have offered to call me and apologize but I don't want to talk to them. I just don't want to be around the guy after what he did to me. I'll probably end up spending some holidays alone, but I don't care. Fuck that guy.

NJ_ThrowAway2019,2019-06-08 18:37:49+00:00,Update: Neighbor touched my son,"  

Original Post here:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/bwkgcw/neighbor\_touched\_my\_son\_nj/](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/bwkgcw/neighbor_touched_my_son_nj/)

I know the original post didn’t get a lot of attention and there probably isn’t much demand for an update, but I did want to thank the people who commented and maybe give some guidance on expectations for anybody who might have the horrible luck to fall into a similar situation. Also it’s just not something we want to talk about with friends/family…. So call it therapy for me.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

TLDR for the 1st post: Last Monday, soon after I left for night school, my son (5) reported to my wife that our (deaf &amp; mute) neighbor touched his private parts.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

Update: On Tuesday morning the entire family went to the police station to file a report. My wife and I interviewed with an officer and detective together at 1st and then my wife alone. After that the detective contacted the county prosecutor’s office.

An hour or so later we were on our way to a county facility, so we could all be interviewed by a couple of detectives from the county prosecutor’s office. Once interviews were over the county detectives sat down with my wife and I to let us know my son had given them some actionable information and they intended to act relatively quickly. The detective who interviewed the children had tears in her eyes. 

From there we went home.

That afternoon, Neighbor knocked on the door, looking to play with the kids. I opened the inner door (left the storm door closed) and made it clear he needed to go away, which he did. Soon after I went to night school, asking my wife to stay in doors with the kids for the night, which she did. When I got home, she said nothing else had occurred.

For the most part, Wednesday was quiet and relatively normal. We did not see Neighbor all day. Wednesday night, we came to know why. A detective called to let us know Neighbor had been taken into custody on Tuesday night (while I was at school) and would remain in custody for a few days until his hearing (I assume arraignment).

Thursday morning a woman from the state DCF/CP&amp;P office came to the house. She made a cursory check of the house and interviewed my wife &amp; I together. To my mind, this was actually a good thing.  She was able to let us know that Neighbor had been charged with 2 counts (I don’t recall exactly what they are). She also provided 2 other important facts:

1 – Neighbor had a history, albeit old (late 80s, early 90s) and in California.

2 – Neighbor had admitted the act to the detective that arrested him on Tuesday evening.

From there, she advised we were entitled to have my son evaluated by a state specialist and possibly therapy if necessary. We will need to have them check in with us once a month until the case is closed on their end, and the evaluation etc. will necessarily extend that time frame, but we opted to go this route anyway.

While she was there I asked if she knew what the likely penalty was (she did not), and whether or not she thought we should pursue a restraining order, if Neighbor was likely to be free again soon. She was unsure and promised to check in with the detectives on the subject.

Friday (yesterday) afternoon, we received a call from the county detective. She informed us that Neighbor’s hearing was set for Monday and that his lawyer intended to ask that he be released to his home, with an ankle monitor, for the period between the hearing and his trial. She wanted to ask for our input as to how hard the prosecutor should push to have Neighbor remain in custody.

Here’s the thing. Neighbor, so far as we can tell, actually lives with a family… and they have small children. I advised the detective that we were ok with Neighbor being ‘home’, so long as he was confined to (approximately) his property. She confirmed that would be the case, and that a ‘no contact’ order would be in place. We agreed that was ok with us, but also said we felt strongly the family with whom Neighbor lives should have input.

That brings us up to date and, to be honest, I am torn. I HATE what this man did. I hate that it has happened before, and I never want it to happen again. With that said, at first I was unsure as to whether or not Neighbor even knew what he did. He clearly has some emotional/intellectual challenges. But he also knew, at least to some extent, what he was doing…. As he admitted the act to the arresting detective. I get the feeling he is something akin to a deaf/mute Lennie from Of Mice &amp; Men, and that tears my heart out. I don’t think he really understands, and I don’t want to be vindictive to someone like that. At the same time, he touched my son. If there were no clear impairment, I would want to take a baseball bat to his head. But there is, and instead I just feel like shit for everyone involved. This sucks, full stop.

On a more selfish note, the Megan’s law registry. There are a handful of homes for sale in the area. Until now, my wife and I were hopeful that more families with children would move into the area. That hope is now over. Because Neighbor’s history all predates Mega’s Law, he was not on the registry. Now he will be, and no families with kids will move into the area. I realize this is tangential to the main topic, and pretty self-centered, but it’s just one more way that Neighbor is going to make our lives a smidge worse, just by existing. To repeat myself, this sucks, full stop.

Sorry for the book, and if the Mods see fit to remove the update… as it’s not all that particular to legal matters, I understand. Honestly, I just feel a bit better getting it all down and putting it out there.

melissalmay2003,2019-06-07 17:35:28+00:00,I suffered a heart attack and was made to wait in the emergency room for 4 hours before anyone believed me. (Pennsylvania),"I am a 35 year old female. Many find it hard to believe I had a heart attack at this age. I live in Northeast Pennsylvania.

On Tuesday, at 3:30 in the morning, I woke up with crushing chest pain. The pain started with a stabbing through my heart and radiated to both upper arms and across my back in between my shoulder blades. I could not move my lower arms very well. My husband called 911 and the ambulance showed up 15 minutes later. The EMTs on scene did nothing to help me except continuously ask me if I was ""on anything like IV drugs"". The medic came and finally agreed to take me to the hospital. The only thing they did for me was put an IV in my left arm. I arrived at the hospital at 4:05.

The ER was not crowded at all. No one came in to see me for a half hour. A nurse finally came in and asked me what was going on and I explained the exact same thing as stated earlier. She left and came back and injected Tramadol into my IV. She left for 45 minutes. The chest pain did not get any better and the stabbing pain was coming in waves that would take my breath away. The nurse comes back, asks my pain level (which was still at a 9), and then proceeds to inject morphine into my IV. She again left for 45 minutes. Cue the nurse again, same question about pain level, it is still the same.  She goes to get the doctor. The doctor comes in and asks me what's going on, am I sure I don't take IV drugs, have I been traveling recently, useless questions. I then receive a dose of fentanyl into my IV.

I am left alone again for 45 minutes, in excruciating pain. At 6:45 am, the doctor sends me to get a cat scan of my chest. When I return, he does an ultrasound of my heart, which comes back inconclusive. At 7:30, the nurse comes in and gives me aspirin. She says they are waiting for cat scan results. 8 am, the doctor tells me he thinks I have an infection around my heart and they are looking for an ambulance to transport me to a bigger hospital. 8:20 he tells me they found a doctor who will see me, but since I still have chest pain, they have to life flight me out to the big hospital. 17 minute flight.

After I wake up in Cardiac ICU, I am told I have had a major heart attack. My LAD was 100 percent blocked and they had to put a stent in. I was lucky to survive. I currently have un repairable damage to my heart from waiting so long to get into the Cath Lab.

My question is, Do I have any grounds to sue the original hospital for not taking me seriously and making me wait almost 5 hours before actually helping me?",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/bxxen9/i_suffered_a_heart_attack_and_was_made_to_wait_in/,legaladvice,1626,83,0.0
losthiker234,2019-06-06 21:52:36+00:00,"New Mexico, my neighbor keeps calling the police on me.","About a month ago we got a new neighbor. I think she has some sort of mental disability. As near as I can tell she sleeps all day and is up all night. Since she has moved in she has called the cops on me numerous times. Multiple times a week.

&amp;#x200B;

She has said that I'm walking around with a gun, I don't even own a gun. She has said I broke into her apartment and raped her. That I've murdered someone in the courtyard. That I've started a fire. That I've planted bombs in cars. Many other things.

&amp;#x200B;

These reports always come in when my wife and I are asleep. We get woken up by the police in the middle of the night. These encounters can take some time while they investigate her accusations. I've never been arrested for anything she alleges.

&amp;#x200B;

There are 2 dozen apartments in our complex and I don't know why she fixated on me. I said hi to her when she moved in and carried a few boxes. She doesn't call the police on anyone else.

&amp;#x200B;

The town we live in is pretty small and the same police officers have knocked on our door so many times they're almost apologetic now. I understand the police have a job to do, but it's getting old.

I moved into this place in January, and up until May it was just me and the other roommate. In April LL told us a couple (not 1 person) would be moving into the empty room. I was fine with it because i didn't care that much.

When they moved in it became instantly apparent it was not just a couple, it was a couple, 2 kids, and another man. We immediately told our landlord, and the couple would keep re-iterating they are allowed to have guests. Landlord has told them no they cannot do this as it is not safe as the unit is overcapacity, but they just have ignored him.

Those guests have now been here for over a month, our landlord is trying to evict them through the LTB. But it has left me and my roomate in an extremely shitty situation. On top of this our landlord has basically told us if he lets us ether of us out of the lease then the family will completely take over the entire apartment, and he won't be able to re-rent it.

The family eats my food, i can't leave anything outside of my locked room. Last week the father and mother got into a huge screaming argument (that i cannot understand) which led to a domestic abuse incident which terrified me, my roommate called the police and the father was removed. He came back the next day and they have been arguing and screaming every other night.

Last night i invited a friend back to my place only for the father to start screaming at me accusing me of basically being a whore and trying to forcibly force him out of the apartment before i called the police. The police came i explained the situation, and after a bunch of back and forth he finally let my friend enter the apartment.

I am sick of this, i want out now. My roommate's lease is up at the end of August but is planning to just move into her boyfriends and just eat the cost. I don't have that luxury unfortunately, and i am terrified of how this is going to go when she is gone.

I'm driving down a country road with a posted 55 speed limit. Cop car gets in behind me. Bad experiences with cops so I do everything by the books, change to the right lane and use autopilot to maintain the exact speed limit, letting the cop pass.

Cop changes to my lane and starts tailgating instead of passing. I maintain speed limit. After several minutes, the lights and sirens go on and I get pulled over.

I’ve almost hit a 3 YO in my complex at least 5 times now because his parents sit on the second floor porch and throw balls at him, and he sprints out into the parking lot to get them.","I live in Kyle Texas, just south of Austin in an apartment complex
This kid is definitely no older than 3 years old. A lot of times I’ll be coming home and he will just suddenly run out into the parking lot from behind a parked car chasing some toy, and I have to slam on my brakes every time to avoid hitting him. He absolutely doesn’t look either way. It’s damn near like watching a joke cartoon scene except I have to restart my heart after almost killing a toddler. 
I’ve seen his family sitting up on the second story porch, watching him do this and saying nothing and oftentimes he will throw a big rubber ball up at them and they’ll throw it back down which is often what sends him running into the parking lot. Ive looked around and there’s never an adult actually down on the ground with him that I’ve been able to see, they’re all up on the porch which means obviously they’re not gonna be able to get down to him in time to prevent an accident. And oftentimes he’s alone, just throwing the ball up at the building and chasing it into the lot when it bounces off. I’ve also seen multiple other cars almost hit the kid. It’s been going on for several months now. 
I’m seriously concerned that eventually either I or another resident is going to hit this poor kid and he’s so small that even at 15 miles an hour it’s going to kill him. I don’t want to straight up call the police, I felt like that was absolutely overkill by itself and then add to that that this family is black and this is a hick town in the south, I am really really trying to avoid any police officers in the situation. But this is serious endangerment in my opinion, I’ve watched this child almost die multiple times now and the family is either directly responsible (by throwing shit into the street) or passively neglectful (by simply watching him run out there so much or the times they’re not even on the porch). But I don’t want to call and waste someone’s time if it would be more appropriate to just email or meet with my leasing manager and talk to her about the problem since I’m not familiar with cps and don’t know if this would actually be something they’d put the time in to come take care of.

CTEisajoke,2019-06-01 14:39:04+00:00,(UPDATE) We are being sued for $1m for an auto accident. I believe our insurance attorney is compromised.,"[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/agel48/we_are_being_sued_for_1m_for_an_auto_accident_i/)

Its been 4 months since my post where we had a ghost passenger sue is for over 1m. 

To Recap: Our driver was involved in a three-car pile-up where we were in the back, the middle driver was alright and did not press charges, the front car had 1 passenger as confirmed by me (as I went to the scene) our driver, and the police report. This front car was suing us. When we were subpoenaed to court, the documents indicated that now there were 2 people in the front car. Again, there was no 2nd person in the police report or that we saw. Sometime later, there was a 3rd person in the vehicle. Our insurance company was based on the other side of the country hired a legal team to represent us. This team had the audacity to tell me that sometimes the police fill out reports incorrectly.  They also told me to not worry and that they will do everything in their power to ensure that the claim does not go over 1m so I don’t pay out of pocket, as if they are doing me a favor. 

We can't prove this but other attorneys reviewed the case and suggest that this team is systematically trying to screw us and could potentially be working with the plaintiff. At one point, they scheduled the hearing to be 2 months away without consulting us or giving us a date. Other attorneys told us a case like this typically waits 6 to 12 months before a hearing. 

Follow up: After all of our complaints, the insurance company finally allowed us to use our chosen attorney after weeks of back and forth emails with their corporate office. We hired a private investigator as well. On the day of the hearing, we presented a dashcam provided by the middle car which showed only 1 person in the front car. Their lawyer was fuming and asking why he didn't know there was a dashcam. We didn't learn about it until our private investigator found out as the middle car never reported having one in the police report.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/bvlgt9/update_we_are_being_sued_for_1m_for_an_auto/,legaladvice,14976,4,0.0

Long story short, one kid ate a Carolina Reaper hybrid (stronger than a ghost pepper) whole and ended up having to go to the hospital by ambulance. Several others also got violently ill eating various other kinds of peppers. 

The phone number listed was one of the kids' dads and he was pissed as all of get out. He was telling me I was crazy for having peppers like that out where people could get to them, he was asking for my insurance, saying he was going to get the police involved. I told him money was tight right now and I didn't currently have renters' insurance, he said he would be sending me a bill and I should pay it if I don't want to be sued or charged with assault. He wanted my landlord's information too but I wouldn't give it to him, he said he would find it in public records. I gently reminded him that his kid shouldn't have been on my property. I tried not to seem like a dick, I really do feel terrible the kids got hurt. Anyways, he wasn't having it. He was already yelling but he started cussing me out so I hung up. He tried calling me back three more times and I didn't answer. 

I can't afford a lawyer and don't even know what kind I would need, so I figured this was the next best thing. Can he really sue me for this? I don't think I can afford their hospital bill, what do I do? Is this really an actual crime like he said? What would my landlord do? Could I be evicted for this? 

Thanks in advance

Can I be charged with harboring a minor if I take him to Missouri?","Boys Town, NE is a foster system village that houses children full-time and has them attend school on campus. Most children are sent by court order however if a parent deems them ""too difficult"" they can pay to have Boys Town take in their child until they become an adult. 

My younger brother \[18\] was sent to Boys Town, Nebraska by my parents \~9 months ago when he was still 17.  The age of majority in Nebraska is 19, so even though he is 18 he is not considered an adult yet. He was smoking weed and skipping school which was the argument they used for his admission. He has not graduated high school yet either. 

He hates it there, has been transferred foster homes because other boys have beat him up, he's run away multiple times, and has since essentially forced to become involved in a bad crowd of criminals, drugs users, and gang members to survive. Boys Town kids often run away and hide out until they are 19, something I DON'T want him to resort to.

I'm 21 and I am a legal resident in the state of Missouri. I have the financial means to take him in and send him to high school in my area. This is something we've talked about and he is thrilled about the idea. Does he have a right to an attorney at 18 in Nebraska? Can they legally keep him there against his will if he wasn't sent by court order? And if I were to take him to Missouri without becoming his guardian or something could I be charged with harboring a minor? 

There is NOTHING online about the legality of the Boys Town situation and rights of the kids there, and I'm worried they and my parents will fight it hard if I go a legal route. I'm really concerned about his mental and physical health in the foster system.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr:  I \[21, F\] have the financial means to support my brother \[18\] and take him away from the Boys Town Foster System in Nebraska. Nebraskans aren't considered adults until age 19. Is there a way I can fight this and become his guardian?

https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/bsdyro/manitoba_canada_my_cousin_lives_in_a_basement/

My cousin and I want to thank all of you for the incredible amount of advice and support you have offered him. He couldn't believe how many people cared, and was touched by the very kind messages we have received by you fine folks. Thank you so much! This situation was resolved rather quickly, so thankfully it's all over.

Now for the update: My cousin is moving out this weekend. He spoke to the landlord several times, citing several laws he was breaking and how my cousin pays for his own power and therefore he shouldn't have his electricity shut off just because the landlord wants to save a few dollars. Also, one of you messaged me to let me know that breakers aren't meant to be turned on and off frequently, and that he is going to burn out all of his fuses if he continues. The landlord refused to listen and told him he shouldn't believe everything he reads on the internet. My cousin went ahead and printed out many comments from you folks, as well as copies of the laws he was breaking, and he told him that if he doesn't stop he would get authorities and lawyers involved. Needless to say, the landlord did not like that one bit. After an argument, the landlord stated that my cousin should move out as he didn't trust him anymore (???) and my cousin was genuinely sad as he liked this man and had considered him a friend before all of this. The landlord said that he will not change his mind no matter how hard my cousin fights it, and that it's best that he just moves out.

Anyways, the landlord told him that if he moves out he will void the lease and return the rent he has paid up for June, July, and August, as well as the security deposit - all under the condition that he moves out by the end of the month and doesn't get lawyers or anybody else involved. My cousin decided to cut his losses and move on. Luckily, my cousin is a minimalist and has very little to pack and move. He is going to be moving in with his girlfriend, which he is very happy about, and he will not be pursuing anything against the landlord as he got all of his money back (about $3000) and he doesn't have to deal with James ever again.

While my cousin didn't get the outcome he wanted, he still got a pretty good deal. He was planning on living with his girlfriend sometime in the near future, so this event just sped things along. My cousin and I honestly feel bad for James as the man has gone through a lot and has had a pretty rough life. Still, this doesn't excuse his behaviour and nonsensical rules.

And that is it. Thank you all again for your help and support, it was honestly overwhelming. Take care, you beautiful people.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/bugy4u/manitoba_canada_update_my_cousins_landlord/,legaladvice,9139,2,0.0

joehioagain,2019-05-28 13:11:31+00:00,[OH] Mortgage brokers keep checking my credit report a year after I purchased a house.,"About a year ago I was looking to get pre-approved for a home loan. My local credit union had a rate of 4.6% and an online lender had a rate of 4.5%. Not a big difference in the grand scheme of things but I plan on staying in this house for a long time, plus the online lender had lower closing costs. The day after putting my information into the online lender’s website, I get 3 calls and half a dozen emails from different lenders ready to pre-approve me immediately. Annoying but whatever. I ended up going with my credit union since it might end up only costing me a couple thousand dollars more at most, since I planned on paying far more than my minimum loan payment.

All that worked out and I bought a house last July. I would still get calls maybe once every month wanting to pre-approve me for a mortgage. I declined every time, telling them I already purchased a home. 

Last month, I totaled the truck that I had for the last 7 years. I was going to be getting a different car in the near future anyway but this was a little sooner than I thought. Went to the dealership, found a moderately priced vehicle and decided to finance what insurance didn’t cover, which was about half. The dealership showed me my credit score and it was way below what I think it should have been. They were trying to get me to take a 13% loan. I balked, spoke with my dad and he cosigned a loan with me at 5.5%. Still weird my credit score was so low so I took a look at my credit report.

23 different lenders have run hard checks on my credit the last year with the last one being at the start of May. There were 8 from when I purchased my house then 1-3 every month since then. I had no idea how or why it’s happening. Obviously I didn’t authorize these checks.

About four weeks ago I found scorpions on my external door and in the backyard and management came out and sprayed. I then found a scorpion inside my house and they came back and sprayed inside. I also hired my own pest control company who sprayed as well.

The company hired by the manager told me the only way to truly get rid of scorpions is to get a blacklight (they glow) and crush them (I have been doing this every night). Another company told me the unit needs to be resealed because scorpions can get through any crack a credit card can fit into through (it’s an old unit and there are gaps everywhere). 

After the spraying I didn’t really notice a decrease in scorpions outside, but didn’t see anymore inside. A few days ago, however, I woke up to two scorpions in the kitchen. My dog grabbed one and was stung in the mouth. I knocked it away from him and it stung me in the process. I was stung a second time by a different scorpion on the foot while I was checking on my dog.

Since AZ has the venomous bark scorpion (most common type here, which these look like) I took my dog to the emergency vet. He was shrieking in pain and clawing at his face. He was given medication and has recovered. My stings burned like fire and seem and provoked a mild asthma attack. Within a day my roommate was stung by a scorpion on his leg while watching TV, but didn’t have as bad of a reaction as I did (localized burning and numbness, but didn’t spread through the whole body like mine did). 

I am currently not staying at the property for fear of being stung again. I have tons of pictures of the scorpions inside and requested that my lease be terminated early, but my property manger is not responding.

What is my recourse here? These things are dangerous and can crawl up walls and ceilings. I have found them in my clothes and towels.

We actually never got the chance to record him. After the police were involved, I think he finally calmed tf down. We spoke to the property manager after the 14/30 was issued, and she essentially said that they had no documentation on our end of any complaints against him, so she did what she felt was right with the info she had (all of his complaints had been verified by staff according to her). We said that is unfair, and we informed her we had complained, and even had to get the cops involved. She said she was unaware of any of that. Great communication between staff, I suppose. She said moving forward, call the 24 hour line.

One night we heard him, and called the 24 hour maintenance/complaint line as instructed. The maintenance guy actually stopped by and spoke to us, and said he had NEVER heard ANYTHING from our apartment, EVER (weird, considering the manager said his complaints were all validated). One time we had 6 complaints filed against us in one evening around 7 PM when no one was home.

I called the property manager the next morning, I was pretty pissed. I made her aware of everything the maintenance guy told us, and all she had to say was along the lines of ""well, he knows the maintenance side of things. But not the management side of things. Its important to have a manager be involved with these noise complaints."" (THEN WHY DO YOU HAVE MAINTENANCE RESPOND TO THEM? Also, you didn't need that when he filed against us, but whatever.) I told her I expected them to hold him to the same standard, and I expect to be left alone from this point forward.

I'm a male in my 20s.

Last weekend we had a family reunion in a cabin resort in the woods. On the last night there, while everyone was sitting by the campfire, my uncle (by marriage), snuck up behind me and blasted an air horn about a foot  or two away from the back of my head. This air horn was not a normal little one you often see at sporting events. This campground has bear  around, so they keep several large air horns around the place to be used to scare off a bear in case they get too close.

As soon as he did it, everyone called him an asshole and got angry at him. He showed no remorse whatsoever. He laughed about it, telling us how he and his friends from work have blown air horns at each other before as a prank.

I was so furious when it happened that I didn't know what to do. I sat there quietly stewing in my rage for a while. I wanted to beat the shit out of him or hold him down while I emptied half of the air horn directly into his ear. But instead I  walked away eventually and spent the rest of the night in my room. It's important to know that this uncle was hosting this reunion. It's a ""corporate retreat campground"" that his company lets employees use.

He clearly knew he fucked up because he attempted to apologize the next day, but it was a pretty shitty apology. While everyone was sitting down for breakfast, he snuck up behind me, put his arms on my shoulders and quietly said, ""I heard your ears were ringing. Sorry about that."" He didn't even say it to my face, or say it loud enough for anyone else to hear. I grumbled something about ""it's okay,"" but I absolutely do not forgive him.

This happened last Saturday, a week ago. For the first couple days my ears were literally sore, and any loud noises were painful to hear. Since then, my ears have been constantly ringing. It's the worst when I'm in a quiet environment, like  trying to work or go to sleep. I hear this high pitched sound that is driving me nuts. Sometimes it'll start to subside, but it still comes and goes. I think I could have permanent hearing damage.

This  guy has been giving me shit since I was a young kid, so this was not a one time occurrence, though this was definitely the worst thing he's done to me by far. I've contacted a personal injury lawyer in my area to learn about my options, but I figured some people here might have good info as well. I won't hear back from the lawyer until tomorrow at the earliest. Any info is appreciated. Suing my uncle would tear a huge hole in my family, but I really don't care about that if I end up having a ringing in my ear for the rest of my life.

drummerjcb,2019-05-25 20:05:14+00:00,I just got three tickets in the mail from a private company who installs cameras on school buses [TX],"I work at a studio in Austin, Texas that is tucked away in a neighborhood off South Congress. There is a school nearby. I usually arrive at work around noon and leave after dark, but this day in particular, my call-time was 2:45. School lets out at 3:15, so the buses were lined up in the street, leaving only enough room for one lane of traffic at a time. I stopped and the crossing guard waved me through.

Of the ten buses lined up, I’m guessing three of them had their flashers on, which automatically triggers the cameras to take photos of cars, because a week later, I received three tickets in the mail for $300 each ($900 total) from the private company who installs these cameras. There is a due date, and if I don’t pay within 30 days, the fines increase and will ultimately be sent off to collections. I have reached out to the city of Austin as well as this private company and neither of them are willing to budge or help in this situation.

I understand that school bus cameras are designed to ensure the safety of children, but this doesn’t feel right. There were no children present at the time of the incident and I was waved through by a police officer (potentially security or SRO) in a hi-visibility vest, who can literally be SEEN in the photos I was sent.

To be clear, I haven’t received a citation or a formal ticket — this is an invoice from a private company dressed up to look like a ticket. Upon further research, this is a company that specializes in red light cameras and school bus cameras. Cities allow them to install these cameras in exchange for a small payout of the fines they’re able to collect.

Baba_dook_dook_dook,2019-05-24 07:30:58+00:00,"[Manitoba, CANADA] My cousin lives in a basement suite. His landlord has recently enacted a new rule in their home that states ""Lights Out By 10PM"" - which is enforced via circuit breakers to ""save on power"" and lower landlord's power bills, except my cousin is paying for his own power.","As the title states, my cousin is currently renting a basement suite in the house of an older gentleman who owns the property. Legally, the renting situation is done by the book and follows the law to a T. However, three weeks ago my cousin received a notice stating that there will be a new addition to the rules that says ""Lights Out By 10PM"". My cousin isn't overly bothered by this as he is usually in bed by 9PM anyways, and he can understand his elderly landlord wanting peace and quiet at night. Unfortunately, he realized immediately (when it first came into effect) that this is enforced by the landlord by physically turning off the power to the whole house by use of the circuit breakers - aside from the breakers for the refrigerators and freezers. This leads to a few problems:

1. My cousin is unable to see where he is going when using the bathroom or getting water at night without the use of a flashlight or phone (candles are forbidden in the basement suite).
2. My cousin is unable to charge his phone overnight, which is a major issue as he needs it for an alarm and worries about it dying - leading him to potentially sleep in. He can't even run an extension cord from the same socket as the fridge and freezer because he might blow the breaker, and the new rule specifically states that extension cords are not permitted if they are going to be used to circumvent the new rule.
3. The landlord rarely turns on the power at the designated time (8am) due to him either sleeping in, going to church, or just straight up forgetting. This leads to shits, showers, and shaves in the dark (no bathroom window) and is generally an inconvenience.
4. My cousin pays for his own power, and therefore he should be allowed to use his power as he sees fit. Instead, he has to live with this situation because his landlord wants cheaper bills.


We both understand that this a silly first world problem, but he is tired of feeling like he's living the Amish lifestyle and wants to know if there is any legal recourse he could take to find common ground with his landlord.

My husband (27m) had a different dentist from the one I (26f) had been using since I was a kid. There was a period of time he didn’t go to the dentist for a couple of years. So about 4 years ago he went back to the same dentist he used to use, and his mother has always used. 
That dentist in NJ told my husband he had 13 cavities! So my husband listened and went back to start having them filled. He “filled” at least two then my husband stopped going again. 

Fast forward to now, I went to see my dentist on Tuesday and made appointment for my husband to go in today (Thursday).  MY dentist showed my husband his X-rays and told him his teeth are perfect! And that he actually had pre drill holes where this other dentist was going to fill fake cavities!! This is so wrong! My MIL also had thousands of dollars of work done to her mouth that could also have been unnecessary. She is making an appointment with my dentist to get another opinion on her mouth. 

We are members of legal shield so I would assume we would work though them. But I am curious on what legal action we can take or what we would have to do to take care of this. I would for sure think this is medical malpractice and I would hope he loses his license for this abuse.

lurkfromthedepths,2019-05-19 13:57:57+00:00,Ex fails drug test giving birth to her baby and now DSS wants to do a home visit with me.,"So the backstory goes like this: 

Ex and I had a son together. She decided one day to split and go live the party life. I take our son and move on and meet and marry my now wife. Wife and I buy a house and have a new baby ourselves. Ex meets someone and they become meth heads together. At that point I sought custody of our son and won. Our custody arrangement states that I have primary care and she is to only see him every other weekend supervised at/by her parents. Which for a long time she rarely, if at all showed up. Ex and new boyfriend have extremely volatile and abusive relationship, she gets pregnant and new boyfriend leaves. Ex appears to have gotten it together enough now that she’s pregnant. Or so it appeared.

On to the issue. 

Ex gives birth to new baby. I get a phone call THAT DAY from dss saying that they’d like to come do a home visit to check on my son because she failed a drug test (for marijuana) when she gave birth. This was not the first instance during the pregnancy that dss was involved. From my understanding, she failed for the same reason early in the pregnancy so I guess dss kept her on their radar. So dss calls me explains what’s happening and even asks if I’d be willing to do a drug test as well.

I have and want as little as possible to do with my ex. As I stated, i moved on and feel I’m doing well for me and my family. She is the unfortunate consequence for my young naivety. I do not regret having my son I just wish she wasn’t his mother. 

So because of her actions and choices, I’m being dragged in by proxy. 

My job is very laborious and in the interest of full transparency, I myself (responsibly) smoke weed at night before bed. 

So what are my options as far as what dss is asking of me? Do I consent to everything? Do I seek legal representation? What happens if I take the drug test and fail? Will I lose my kids? 

This is really the most stressful situation for me and my wife who have nothing to do with her and her problems except the fact she’s my sons mother

I am currently month to month on an apartment that is downtown Toronto, and have lived here for about 3 years now with my fiancee. Previous rental company was great, unfortunately as of the start of last month a new owner came and took over management of our apartments.

It is very obvious to both me and my girlfriend, along with some other people we have talked to that they want all the old renters out.

* When they took ownership they replaced everyone's locks with new electronic locks that require a key fob. If you have a single unit, you get 1 fob, if you have a double unit you get 2. However since like myself me and others don't live alone it causes problems. We found a-way around that like everyone else and that is by shoving our fobs in our mailbox when we leave.
* We have wellness checks every week now. We have been given written warnings indicate we are not keeping our unit up to their standards of cleanliness. Their standards are beyond insane, and we have recieved 3 written warnings with no real explanation for what they are complaining about. Last time they were here i was also here, and they wrote me up and told me, and refused to answer any of my questions about what was dirty, instead i needed to contact ""management"" as they cannot discuss this with me.
* They tried to make us pay an extra 250$/month for the air conditioner (it was installed by previous company). We rejected them firmly as i told them it wasn't in our lease. They keep pestering us about this fee. 
* For the longest time we have been paying \~450$/month for our parking spot, unfortunately i received a letter basically stating as of June 1st, they will no longer have a parking spot for me. I have called the stupid management number but i keep getting nowhere.

BootLiberator,2019-05-18 18:22:27+00:00,Legality of removing a private company's car boot from vehicles in my neighborhood,"Hi, everyone. Throwaway for reasons...

My HOA has contracted with this ridiculous company who is constantly booting vehicles (sometimes for legit reasons, but often times it is happening to vehicles that are following all of the rules) and it is getting out of hand. They are charging $300+ dollars to remove the boot. It is exorbitant and taking advantage of people; in my opinion it is complete bullshit to charge someone because they forgot their hang-tag IN THEIR OWN ASSIGNED SPOT THAT IS DEEDED TO THEM.

So here's what I've been doing... I go around my neighborhood, I pick the locks that this company uses, and I remove the boot from the vehicle, and then re-lock it on their little boot stand where they keep all the boots on standby. I never damage the boots, my picking method doesn't damage any of the internals of the lock, and I save someone $300+ each time because fuck that noise.

Now to the original question... are there any repercussions (legal/civil) to what I am doing? I am not damaging any property, I am certainly not stealing anything, but what am I not thinking about?

Many residents have already complained to the HOA and they vow to keep complaining until something is done, but for now I would like to continue doing my little part.

One of which was “The only reason that you get along with the Gemeral Manager is because he wants to f-ck you.” Among other things. Two days ago I received an  e-mail from our HR representative that reads: 

Dear Ms. S,
 
Thank you for sharing your concerns with me on May 2nd. I am writing to let you know that the company has completed its investigation into your call, and has taken appropriate action. Please feel free to contact the Employee Relations Department in the future with any follow-ups, and or as you have additional questions or concerns.
 
Thank you again!
 
Best,
 
Ms. A | Employee Relations, HR


Today I was called into a meeting with my supervisors boss(mgmt level 3) and my group coordinator(mgmt level 1, being the lowest). My supervisor (mgmt level 2) who the claim was made against was not present.  My supervisors boss said that I was terminated. When I asked why, he said “I don’t know much about why. I’ve been told it has something to do with your performance.”  I stated that my performance has been exceptional as has been shown in my track record and confirmed in my two prior reviews, and I find this termination highly suspicious. When asked for an example, they refused to give me any example of the alleged poor performance. I handled the situation very calmly and left the room, apologized for anything that I may have done to upset anyone as I am clearly confused as to what the grounds for termination are, and immediately went down to our General Managers (mgmt level4)  office who ranks above all other mentioned parties, and said, “I’ve just been fired.”  He was dumbfounded and had no idea about it. He said, “if this is true, I technically am not allowed to talk to you about this until I speak to HR.” I told him I completely understand. I do not want to put you in a bad position.  He thanked me for making a sexual harassment claim in his behalf. And gave me his personal email so that I could get a letter of recommendation for future employment .

When I came home I responded to Ms. A with the following email:

Dear Ms. A,

Thank you for following up. I am writing to let you know that my employment was terminated by my supervisor this afternoon. I intend to pursue legal action first thing tomorrow morning. An attorney will be in contact to subpoena a complete record of all investigative findings in relation to my prior complaint of being sexually harassed by my supervisor EH. I request that any and all evidence that is pertinent to my complaint be preserved and not destroyed.

Thank you,

I am 24 and live in the USA and I’m on birth control but it failed. I didn’t realize I was pregnant until I went into the hospital for something unrelated and found out I needed surgery for something and that I was pregnant on the same day. I quickly looked into abortion options but haven’t been able to go through with it because I haven’t had the funding but I’m trying to figure that out now so I can get the surgery and be healthy again. 

I went for my surgical consultation and the doctor said he would feel much safer waiting for me to terminate before performing the surgery but I would have to schedule the surgery through his assistant A. A called me shortly after the surgery and pressured me the entire phone call to keep the baby but when I told her I was planning on going through with the termination wouldn’t schedule my appointment until I had gone through with it. So I’ve had to put the appointment off and wait until then, which is fine, but my parents are in on why I need the surgery and I’ve had to come up with excuses as to why I can’t schedule it yet because I don’t want them to try to pressure me to not terminate. 

Fast forward to last tuesday and I get a text from my dad that says something to the effect of ‘we know why you haven’t scheduled the appointment and we’re very disappointed in you.’ It turns out that they called the office and the assistant disclosed my pregnancy to my parents and it’s causing me a great deal of emotional turmoil because my parents have been acting super weird around me and now I’m doubly stressed about the situation. I never gave her or anyone else to disclose my medical status to anyone and I feel like my rights as a patient have been violated.

They live separately but I still call him my step dad)  

His daughter used to live with him until my step dad demanded she get a job or go to school. she instead left with her son and moved in with and married her boyfriend. It was around this time that he had to start preschool, and she said that she was going to home school him and she’s been home schooling him ever since. 

Fast forward three years and their relationship has gotten better so she’ll occasionally drop him off to visit. He’s 8 now and I’ve noticed how far behind he is. I’m a High school senior and do a lot of volunteering at elementary schools. So when he comes to visit I like to spend my time teaching him. I taught him the basic alphabet, first couple numbers, etc. These are things he should know already. He learns very quickly and enjoys it. So I don’t suspected he has any learning disabilities. I also read to him and once gave him a book as a gift. 

A few visits later while talking to him I come to find out that all he knows is what I’ve taught him and that the book I gave him is the only thing he’s been reading because that’s the only book he owns. He also tells me that he doesn’t do “learning time” with his mom. ( “learning time” is what I call it when I teach him )

My friend has a younger brother the same age so I’ll have her bring him over when he’s visiting. While they play he acts like he’s a toddler compared to him. I didn’t think much of it until  my friends little brother asked him if he has any friends and he said no. He tells him that he stays at home all day. 

My step father notices this, and so does my mom and friend. We didn’t say anything to each other not wanting to be rude or sound paranoid but the conversation came up and my step dad admitted he’s been feeling horrible about it ever since. He wants to take action but doesn’t want to get his daughter in trouble. She’s living off welfare and I forgot to mention that she’s legally blind. ( not completely but enough to give her disability ) He’s also scared she won’t let him see his grandson anymore if he mentions it. 


I’m really worried about him but I don’t know what can be done and neither does my step dad. He doesn’t care for her and only wants what’s best for his grandson. He would want to get custody but he works two jobs at the moment and wouldn’t have the time to care for him.

Can anything be done?,"I have to change so many details, but basically I was one of the first people on scene to a horrifying accident where a toddler lost their life. It was literally a freak accident caused from a lack of supervision- the parents weren’t home and left another child way too young to watch them- the older child played video games all day and while alone the toddler got into/did something and lost their life. The parents were so far away, about an hour away working separate jobs in a major city, I never even got a chance to see them at the hospital, it took them about two hours to get there.



No charges were ever brought, at least not in public. It wasn’t covered by media or anything. I don’t know the details, but I always just assumed the horrifying realization of their fatal mistake and having to live with that was punishment enough.

Now fast forward years later and I have kids of my own. I joined a local moms group and there was a mom promoting her business.
I go to her page and see a picture of her dead child. She has created this whole business and online persona about the death of her child. She has created this whole narrative about how this ‘horrifying disease doctors don’t take seriously enough’ killed her child. She has a whole for-profit-blog about how vaccines made her child ill, about how he was on the spectrum from too much medical intervention during pregnancy and birth, and allowed this other disease to make her child so sick he died. As if anything killed her child other than the furniture that crushed them. She talks in detail about being at his bedside in the hospital when he was on life support and apologizing to him for taking him to pediatricians (she never even made it to the hospital when cpr was being done, and he was never resuscitated). Apparently she’s very successful selling her special brand of ‘don’t trust hospitals or doctors’, promoting freebirthing and unlicensed doulas, and selling all different sorts of woo.


I’m just raging that she is promoting off her child’s death. I cant even begin to understand the crushing guilt and maybe needing to reframe his death, but then turning it into her business is just ughhhhh. Can anything be done? She’s pretty solidly protected by HIPAA right??",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/bo64y9/a_local_mom_is_lying_about_the_circumstances_of/,legaladvice,8760,195,0.0

I have a few friends who tell me what’s going on at that place, and one of the educators told me that they were given a document to sign if they wanted to continue working at the center.

The document pretty much says they never saw the boss man do anything illicit with a child and that the signers will cooperate with the investigation, but something about it seems super sketchy. If anything, it sort of seems like not signing the document would make one seem guilty. 

Anyway, my main question is this: Can boss man fire employees who don’t sign a document stating he never did anything illicit with any child?

DarkseidHS,2019-05-12 13:05:14+00:00,[Update] Mother in law suing for visitation in ny.,"On mobile. Also, this is gonna be a bit long. 

Here is the original: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/aq9o11/mother_in_law_is_suing_for_visitation_ny/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share

We went to court for our initial hearing in February. I asked for dismissal citing Troxel V. Granville. The judge agreed that we were within our rights, however she couldn't grant a dismissal because my MIL requested an attorney. The judge advised she didnt qualify for an appointed lawyer so she should seek representation through elder law. My MIL begins raising her hands and waving them around asking if she could be allowed to speak. She states in court that me and my wife bully, abuse, belittle, and swear around the children constantly. The first 3 are outright lies and the 4th, so fucking what? She also stated that she never mentioned once being hacked or being obsessed that she was hacked, and that my oldest daughter was the one obsessed with hacking and spying. The judge made no comments and advised her that we weren't keeping her away from the children and that she should seek relief by visiting them under our supervision. 

Fast forward to a week before the hearing we have to meet with the kaw guardian for the children. We show the law guardian all the insane conspiracy theory texts and the texts where she accuses me of hacking her phone. She spoke with the children and we took our leave. The paperwork we received stated that my MIL showed her a much different conversation. My MIL had deleted the texts that made her look bad and copy pasted several from my wife that made my wife look like a bully and that she was harassing my MIL. The children outright denied any bullying/abuse and stated to the law guardian that my MIL makes them uncomfortable because she is constantly yelling at them, when they want to leave she wont them go and she wont stop talking about who is hacking her. So obviously she supports our position. 

In the hearing my lawyer asked for dismissal, and requested we be paid our legal fees by MIL as the petition was brought in bad faith. My MILs appointed attorney couldnt withdraw and refile an amended petition because MIL wouldnt let her so the judge dismissed and awarded us our legal fees. 

I havent seen the judgement yet but it's my understanding that it was dismissed with prejudice. However my MIL doesnt live in reality and is going to file another petition alleging that I've brainwashed my children. I wish that were true, they never listen to me. So I may have another update for you all shortly, but for now I'll enjoy my victory.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/bnoqh1/update_mother_in_law_suing_for_visitation_in_ny/,legaladvice,6649,2,0.0

One of these medications is extremely harsh and causes dehydration and overheating which then causes a whole bunch of nasty stuff.  I have a Dr note stating that I need to keep my water with me at work to avoid this.

One of my managers has been insisting that I cannot have water at work. I repeatedly have pointed out to her that I have a Dr note on file. She says it doesn't matter.  On Thursday though she changed her tune and started saying that this note doesn't exist at all.  Another assistant manager said that she absolutely remembered putting it in there and asked her why it would suddenly be gone.

She insists that I stop taking my medication all together, saying that obviously it does more harm than good and it's a problem for my workplace.

She told multiple other employees what medications I'm taking on Thursday.  After the issue occurred with the sudden disappearance of my Dr note 3 other people approached me saying that she was complaining about me.  All of them were to the tune of *sigh* ""(my name) thinks she gets some kind of special treatment because she takes (medication). Doesn't she understand the rules need to be uniform!?""

And finally, any doses of medication that are needed while I'm at work she will not let me take.  She even tried to confiscate my medication on Thursday

VexxedFox89,2019-05-09 16:37:02+00:00,Neighbor has been intentionally sabotaged multiple offers on my house [OH],"I recently had to move from Ohio to Utah for work and put my house on the market on Monday and have received quite a few complaints from realtors trying to show the property. 

&amp;#x200B;

These include but are not limited to:

1.) Parking in both spots at my house such that potential buyers cannot park at the property to view it. (Intentionally double parking a truck horizontally to block access)

2.) Loudly riding his motorcycle back and forth in front of the property

3.)  Hanging a Confederate Flag on his property during a showing with an  interracial couple (that was very interested in the property and left in  tears because of the treatment, canceled their offer).

4.) Revving the engine of his motorcycle with a Confederate Flag on it during showings of any persons of color

&amp;#x200B;

I have had offers pulled and have had people that were very interested complain directly to their realtor about how they will not be giving an offer because of the behavior.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't have the luxury of sitting down with the neighbor to discuss this as I am over 1600 miles away now. The neighbor never displayed any of this behavior while I lived on the property for about five years and is now doing this to intentionally ensure that the property doesn't sell because he doesn't want to deal with new neighbors.

&amp;#x200B;

I have already filed a complaint with the HOA but this is a situation where time is of the essence (currently paying for two properties and want to sell this house). I'm verging on civil actions at this point because he has been doing this since Monday from my understanding and has shown no signs of stopping or scaling back.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/bmlzfi/neighbor_has_been_intentionally_sabotaged/,legaladvice,2095,59,0.0

She was living with her parents because she was still in school with a low paying job. The second they found out the child would be biracial they told her either abort to stay in their lives (still kicked out) or have the child and be cut out of their life. It was really hard, but she decided to parent her child alone (guy disappeared quickly).

Pretty much our friend group became her and the baby real family. Her guy best friend and I were made to be the godparents. She wrote and told us often, if she passed away, that the child would go to me and have visitations with godfather that was agreed. We didn’t think anything would happen, but if not I wouldn’t be here. 

She has been very low-contact with her parents since being kicked out as in they are only FB friends (restricted from son’s pictures). They’ve never met nor attempted to meet him before the funeral. They only met him at the funeral, in which, our friend group and my parents shielded him. 

Her parents tried talking to me at the funeral and asking could they meet grandchild. I told them at the moment he’s confused (he’s 3) and I’d have to think about it. Her father the sole person pushing for the abortion and cutoff contact angrily says they should be give grandchild or at least visitations since they are his only family. Again I stand firm on thinking about it later. 

BFF’s Aunt the only one in contact with her calls me a week later. She’s trying to tell me to be cautious because of how angry they are about my response  and that they are thinking of suing for custody or at least grandparent rights. They think because I’m now a single parent to godchild and just getting in my career that they can argue I’m not equipped. Which is funny since I literally haven been their godchild entire life (prenatal, birth, live with first 6 months to help bff expenses) and I make more than they do on a dual-income. 

Currently, I live in a city about 3 hrs away from home city and had plans to move to another state after this school year ends for a promotion (with better school opportunities for godchild). Both my current and future state has GPRs. However, I’m not sure what to do, in case, somehow they find out we were moving and try using it as a excuse to keep us here.

He said he wouldn’t let her get away with it. He went back and gave her the check. She refused and he called the police. It was great. She was so embarrassed. Everyone at the restaurant was staring at her. The cops told her to pay for the food she ate or they’d arrest her if she left without paying. She did.

&amp;#x200B;

This happened couple of months ago and I forgot to update you guys. I guess, I just wanted to forget what happened.

Here is the rundown of what I did and what the outcome was.

&amp;#x200B;

I started talking to my neighbors who know my dog and I asked all of them to write what they though about my dog, while being aware of the incident and thankfully every one wrote very nice things about my dog and us as owners.

We went to the hearing and there were many people there for their own dog related incidents. 

After signing up a police officer asked me and my girlfriend to have a word. I will not say who he was but he was basically aware of the situation and he thought that we should not be there. He assured us that we should be fine even before the hearing started.

There were couple incidents we heard prior to ours and they all were related to dogs biting humans. We were the only ones there over a dog fighting another dog.

They called the person who sued me on stand and that's when the show started. He did really put a show for everyone.

He mentioned that his dog was dead for minutes but he resuscitate his dog. He mentioned that there were blood everywhere. He started crying and sobbing. He actually said that he tried to pull his dog from my dog's mouth but he though his dogs skin was coming off. I know it sounds all bad but don't worry because none of this happened and his dog was fine. My dog did really bite him but it was a bark bite where he penetrated skin only and let go. He had pictures with him and he thought those pictures would help his argument but it really did not. It looked like the dog just got scratched.

Once he was done, it was our turn to speak. We kept it cool and explained what happened. We told the judge what we were doing to make sure this would never happen again. I also mentioned how he was asking for money and refusing to show me any bills. And that was it.. I called 3 weeks later and I was notified that our dog was not deemed danger to anyone.

&amp;#x200B;

I know it's been a while and people who gave me opinions here most likely won't see it but I wanted to thank everyone.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR My dog bit another dog over ball. It wasn't serious injury at all. Owner demanded 1k$ + more in time. I agreed but wanted to see bills and owner freaked out and sued us and tried to get my dog put down.

Throwaway for obvious reasons. I'm still shook and my boyfriend and I have been freaking out since we found out. I'm at the end of my rope and don't know what to do.

Our daughter is 11 years old. We found out she was pregnant. She had always been close with a boy from our neighborhood, he's 13. We never thought anything of it as we'd known him and his family for several years since we moved here.

It was clear she had a crush on him, but I never thought anything of it. Until she started complaining about things, I'd rather not go in to detail in, that were very familiar to me from when I had been pregnant. 

I didn't jump to the conclusion, but I did ask in to what they do when they hang out. 

They'd been having sex. God knows he knew about that stuff already but it had been going on for some time. I won't go in to details. Because I never wanted to imagine them myself. 

We had the birds and the bees talk, so she knew where babies came from. My boyfriend was fuming after I told him, and went straight to talk to the parents.

They knew as much as we did of the whole thing. They were as shocked as we were. We've already talked together, and they agree we need to terminate the pregnancy, for many reasons.

But she keeps saying she wants a baby. And I just don't fucking know what to do. I tried to explain all the issues you deal with when pregnant,  I was trying to be level headed. But she didn't seem to understand at all. We've scheduled several visits to the clinic already. 

What can I do? Is the boy, or his parents liable? What can a doctor do? Can the pregnancy be ended without her consent, if she wasn't able to consent in the first place?  
I'm at such a fucking loss. My world is crumbling.

Address is not a typical address ( tons of numbers and unique name) 

About 2 months ago we started to receive mail addressed to someone ( Daniel). The first thing to arrive was from the USPS saying welcome home ( it was that welcome packet when you change your address to a new address and the packet is sent to your address with tons of coupons). Clearly Daniel changed his address to our address. From that point on we receive about 4 - 5 pieces of mail a week ( no bills just junk mail).   


With a little research I found Daniel ( he has a very unique last name) - he seems to be in his 60s in Phoenix, AZ. A mild interesting point is that about 8 years ago my husband and I lived in Phoenix, AZ for a short time ( 6 months) but not in the same part of town. 

  
What we have done - 

We have written - return to sender that person does not live at residence. Mail keeps arriving. 

We have talked to USPS - we told them the situation. They keep saying ""OH it must be someone that previously lived there"" --- unless he was living in a tent in a middle of a field no one lived at our address before us. They never seemed to understand our point. 

SO we are trying to figure out why would someone change their address to our address. Is there any sinister reasons? Should be just ignore the mail? Should I try and reach out to Daniel?",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/bkpuo7/someone_is_claiming_they_live_at_our_address/,legaladvice,2612,140,0.0

There was glass in my brain and small pieces were smashed off. My left foot was pushed to my head effectively snapping my shin. My heart ended up stopping for a while and I was revived. I went through brain surgery, PT, and alot of therapy for the mental trauma of still being concious for parts of it...

I hate to bring this up at all but I know I was awarded a very large settlement to be awarded in blocks in the ages of 21, 23, then finally 25. Im grateful to be alive and I don't want to be a money grubber, but I feel that was rightfully mine or at least I have a right to know the details. My parents assured me that the settlement would be mine and it would pay for my college and grad school yet I'm about to be 23 and whenever I bring it up they tell me it's none of my business? 

Again I really hate to do this but I'm not a money grubber. Ive paid rent since 14 and always paid my way through college. It's just I want to at least know the details of the case instead of being told its none of my business...also my dad has bought two new buildings with money I don't know came from. I'm not saying I'd ask for it back, for all I know it paid for my heavy medical bills...but I still have a right to know.

I am a felon. {Less than a gram charge in 2013-I was a 22yr old punk...} I am now a 28 year old man, and that life is long behind me. I paid the Piper in FULL for it all and have been deeply humbled.

With that being said, I was completely honest with the agency with my record, I made sure they knew this. 100%

This job finally stuck. It was a performance numbers based job. I received electronics and entered information into a computer. You were suppose to scan 8-10 items an hour with a certain error rate.

I always made my numbers. Was even one of the top ""receivers"" on the floor. I averaged 120-150ish scans a day, my error rate was very low maybe 3 ""tags""(errors) in total. because I wanted to prove my worth.

I was never late. Never called in. Came to work and produced. 

My manager was even a family friend that got me the job. He knows my whole history. 

The only reason I posted this was because my old man called me up and said he spoke to his friend who is a really smart 22yr Veteran of the Military. (So is my pops) about my situation. The friend mentioned to my old man that it sounded like ""discrimination"" and I should see a lawyer.

I signed the offer of employment and when they did the 2nd background check I received a call from the temp agency saying they were no longer going to hire me citing my record. Even though I was upfront with my record.

Do I have any kind of legs here? Or is this just what I should expect until I can get my record expunged? 

Kinda shitty man. This job was the best thing that happened to me... I was able to help my mom out and feel like a normal person of society. Idk. I don't want any boo hoo's for me. I know I'm a good person.

I felt wronged in this situation, dirty almost. I understand if I provided  them with reasons like being late, or not performing. But I knew I had something to prove and I did just that. Which is why they offered me the position.

I was in that warehouse for 3 months...

This really set me back financially and honestly my manhood was defeated a bit, but that's life.


Is there anything here for me to pursue?

And is this considered stalking?","So for some reference, my ex husband is a horribly abusive narcissist, during our marriage he tortured me physically, mentally, and emotionally. He kidnapped me in 2017 and I managed to get away and run to the police, where I got my protective order. I have PTSD and cut every tie to him completely out of my life, and I've managed to make a much happier life for myself and I'm even making progress with my PTSD. Well I was, until all this has been happening. Okay now on to where I need help! 

About 2 weeks ago I ran into my ex's best friend at the casino. He sat and watched me and texted someone on his phone for 10-15 minutes. Then a few days later, my coworker texts me telling me that they ran into my ex and he was asking if they knew me (we were old acquaintances anyway) and they said no. Next, about a week ago my ex's brother shows up at my house and rings the doorbell, and I didnt answer. Then, he has his stepbrother send me a friend request on Facebook. And 3 days ago, I was at work (retail) and one of his friends comes in high as a kite and watches me for a few minutes. And the final event, he had one of his best friends come out to my house this morning and ring my doorbell. I have no contact with any of these people, and I havent in over a year and a half. I've been a stone cold bitch with strict no contact with anyone who could even be friends of friends of his. 

So my question, 1) is he violating the protective order by doing this? I have no idea if they were trying to relay a message from him or not. 2) does this qualify as stalking? 3) what are my options?

aquaticquiet,2019-04-29 14:30:23+00:00,[UPDATE][PA] My neighbors were starving their chickens and ducks to death.,"This didnt get a lot of traction at all but for the like 2 or 3 people who responded.

The neighbor apparently told the cop that the chickens died from sharing a space with the ducks. Nothing will be done on that end. There were originally 4 chickens all together and all 4 died within 3 days. There are 3 ducks left. I went out today to offer to purchase the ducks from him to take them to a sanctuary that I found who would have taken them, but they apparently already found a new home for them. The new owners will be coming to pick them up on Wednesday, so hopefully they have a better life after this. The only Orgs that contacted me back were the ones that didn't deal with animal abuse/neglect to let me know they can't help, which I appreciated. I'm pretty upset about the lack of response from the SPCA. They haven't contacted us at all since the day before they said they would come out to investigate. I don't know, maybe one or 2 of the chickens could still be alive if they did. 

Apparently the wife is upset and going crazy about getting rid of the remaining ducks but she literally not once has left her house outside of going to work. She has never ever gone back there with the ducks and chickens. I'm pretty sure she has hoarding tendencies at this point and her husband enables her. The husband didn't seem at all phased we called the cops on him. I think he's just done with the whole situation to be honest.

So I failed at saving those poor chickens but I like to think since the cop came out that they decided to get rid of the ducks. So while the cop didn't seem to care at all about the situation and he just had to be here because it's his job I'm still thankful he showed up because I think it helped scare the neighbor.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/biq4nb/updatepa_my_neighbors_were_starving_their/,legaladvice,5192,2,0.0

I took the advice that I was given and I pled not guilty. Last week I went to court, and here's what happened:

&amp;#x200B;

I brought copies of my cell phone's call log (showing that I called 911 before curfew) as well as the same records from my carrier. I also got a copy of the drunk driver's criminal complaint with the help of the court clerk, and I printed out a copy of the [""justification"" law](https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/legis/LI/consCheck.cfm?txtType=HTM&amp;ttl=18&amp;div=0&amp;chpt=5&amp;sctn=3&amp;subsctn=0).

The hearing started with the officer saying that I was pulled over on the side of the road, that he ""went to investigate"" why I was there, and that I voluntarily confessed to driving past curfew. He said that that was all he needed to prove in order to prove my guilt and basically left it at that.

Then it was my turn to speak. I said that while I did drive past curfew, it was because I had noticed an erratic driver and I was following him because I thought he was going to hurt someone. I felt that if I had let the man go, that he would kill somebody and that 911 had told me to keep following him. I gave my evidence to the judge and to the police officer, and I said that I would have been home on time if not for the drunk driver. I argued that I had a reasonable belief that the man was very drunk and that the police are accusing the driver of having a .12 BAC. (The judge asked the officer about the driver and he confirmed the BAC.)

Finally, I brought up the justification defense. I argued that driving past curfew was a summary offense and that drunk driving was at minimum a misdemeanor and at worst a 1st degree felony if he killed someone. I said that the law clearly provided a defense to my conduct because drunk driving was clearly the greater of the two evils and because I drove in an otherwise safe manner.

The judge agreed and found me not guilty! He said that I had proven my defense by a preponderance of the evidence and that I had done the right thing. I'm going to get my collateral back in the mail in a few days and my record is clean!

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Went to court. Police officer basically said ""the law is the law."" I presented my defense that I was preventing a greater harm under the justification law.

I'm sad about this update for the kid, I took the majority of the given advice and called the police non-emergency number and asked for an officer to come out because I had questions about an issue I'm having and briefly explained it.

Officer shows up, I invite him in and explain the whole situation. He isn't really sure what to do about it right now so he asked for a supervisor come to his position. Supervisor shows up and I go over the whole thing again, we go upstairs to my computer where I have all the videos clipped and saved (9 times of her entering the backyard and 4 of her entering the house through the garage). 

We watched each one and he gets on his cellphone and goes back to his car. A few minutes later he comes back with 3 flash drives and asks me to copy the videos over to the drive and had me fill out a piece of paper stating what I put on the drive and then signed it, I repeated it all 3 times.

About 45 minutes later after we have been talking and he's been on and off his cellphone the entire time, 2 CPS workers show up and review the videos again and take a complete statement from me going back to the first time it happened. This took about two hours because they wanted it to be precise and as accurate as I remember it and left out anything I wasn't 100% sure on.

The officers and CPS workers head next door to talk to the parents, parents apparently shut the door in their faces and said they didn't want to talk but because of my statement and the videos of her climbing over, getting stuck, having to be carried back over the times I'm at work or gone and just entering the house they had probable cause to enter the home anyways.

After they were inside their house for about 10-15 minutes another cop car shows up followed by another a few minutes later. I'm in my garage so I don't know exactly what happened inside but after more officers showed up the father was put in the back of a car and the daughter was put into the CPS workers van and they left. The father was driven away about 10 minutes after that, then about an hour later the mother is also put into the back of a car and they drive away.

I talked to the initial officer that showed up and asked for a supervisor and he tells me they found drugs (pills not in prescription bottles/not their prescriptions) and that the home was just not being taken care of inside and definitely not a safe environment for a child. Said they found drugs not secured and in areas the child had access to them.

I haven't seen them since the day after the post, I feel bad for the kid being in that situation and me being a neighbor not even knowing and my not wanting to call the cops (I didn't think it was anything like they found, I just figured it is really tough raising a kid and add on top of that severe mental disabilities and it's even tougher).

To note. The house hadn’t been lived in for about 4 months prior. And is in an OKAY area of Cleveland, OH. 

I’ve been moved in for about a month and a half - I’ve heard whats sounded like footsteps at first and then I’ve just chucked it up to being new house sounds. I’ll be honest and say I’ve been too scared to see if anything’s up there since I’ve moved in so I’ve never even seen then attic. Today my sister and her boyfriend were staying over for the holidays and I asked him to check it out. He popped up with a flashlight and there’s a tent set up. He came down and told me. My sister and I came outside and he locked the back door and came out the front. The back door is directly in front of where the attic opens. We called the cops and waited about ten minutes. Once the cops arrived the back door was unlocked and no one was in the tent. Cops didn’t do anything and didn’t even go up to check. They were neato. So I put my head up to check while they were there. It’s a tent. There’s playing cards. They took my name and left. 

Sooo I nailed the attic shut and blocked all entries to my home. I was thinking first thing I should do is get new locks and window monitors in the morning.

I was sitting in my back garden enjoying the sun, and my neighbours were having a bonfire. All of a sudden, I hear screaming and call the fire brigade! I obviously look over the fence and see a fire spreading to the fence and surrounding trees. They’ve poured petrol on it and thrown the petrol up the fence or something. 

I’m a firefighter, so I told them to open their gate. I went over and used their hose reel to put the fire out. They were grateful and I went about my day. There was a decent amount of fire damage to the fence, grass and the trees.

Today they sent me a letter saying they have intent to sue me in small claims for the price of the fence. Their reasoning is that because their friend is a firefighter in a different country, and he’s told them if they called the fire brigade instead they wouldn’t been able to use the high pressure hose reel that puts out more water and the fire wouldn’t have spreaded so far.

This is true, but it would’ve taken at least 4-5 minutes for the fire brigade to turn up, with a further 2 minutes at least to get the water on.

Citybosses,2019-04-21 13:09:10+00:00,"[CA] I want to divorce my wife of 6 years, who has been a Jehovah’s Witness for the last 4 years because of the extreme teachings of the cult, and how it could affect our children (3,1).","So I started looking deeper into all of this amidst my wife and I’s simultaneous suspicions that her mentors within her church were “poisoning us.”  They would bring us food all the time over a couple month period, and we were constantly sick.  Since cutting those people out we have been better.  I want to the hospital to have us all screened, but they referred us to a social worker, who is talking with police on the matter.   

This is when I started looking deeper into this “religion.”  Long story short, I want as far away as I can from this stuff as well as my children.  I’m a military veteran who is 29, and has supported my family entirely up until now.  I have only been out of the military for a a little over a year now, and have bad anxiety and ptsd issues that have made attaining a job hard, so I’m living off my GI bill through the military (monthly check to supplement education post military -36 months), and military disability.  My spouse is hesitant to work, because the people in her religion tell her a wife should be at home.  

I thought I was being a supportive husband by supporting her choice of religion, but now that I’ve learned more, I can’t.  I’ve tried to talk calmly about this to her many times, but it goes nowhere.  The religion is designed to warn her about people like me, “worldly” people.   She goes on talking about “the end” all the time like she is anticipating it.  I hate to say it, but I fear the brainwashing has potentially dulled her sense of reality.   Even after knowing these people could have poisoned her own children, she defends the organization as a whole.  She doesn’t want to go to any conventional counseling because “other people don’t need to know our problems.”  I have no idea what do to at this point.

I probably will be supporting our family by my previously mention means while I try to get mentally stable again to work full time over the next couple of years.  I only have about $15,000 in savings, and I own our only vehicle, a fully paid off car.  We have furniture and stuff but I’m not attached to any of it.  I have a life insurance policy that was converted from my military SGLI to a VGLI and that’s it for assets.   Other than that, no big debts or anything.   

Over the last 4 years, this is kind of how the split has been raising the kids:

2016,17:  I was in the military, my wife would handle the morning routine with the kids because I left early in the morning and got home in the afternoon, and would play with the kids and help with everything like cleaning, brushing teeth, putting to bed etc.  The only thing I didn’t do much was cook, which I only did maybe once a week.  



2018,2019 (post military):  I spent 2018 looking for and working several different jobs that didn’t last long, mostly in part to stress and adjustment disorder, and as a result only worked about 5 months last year, which ate into savings. Besides that, we have done everything in terms of taking care and spending time with the kids kids equal.

As I right this, I hide my children’s Easter eggs alone in the backyard, as my wife will stay in the bedroom today because of the “holiday” she is not allowed to celebrate.   The psychological effect of never having their mom around for birthdays and holidays is only going to get worse, and it’s hard on me to have to see them do it alone. What kind of parent doesn’t want to have fun with their children smh.   

What is a divorce going to look like with her? I really just don’t want to give up my disability pay for life or my gi bill payments for school.  Furniture, car, belongings can be split idgaf.

EmiliaClarkeGG,2019-04-20 09:47:41+00:00,Detained and Deported at London Stansted due to Airline incorrect re-routing,"This is a request for advice regarding an extremely unfortunate set of circumstances that led to a situation at London Stansted on Thursday April 18 and Friday April 19 (in the early hours of yesterday morning). I am a South African national, Dutch residence card holder who requires a visa when transiting through the UK. I was detained and deported from London Stansted on the night of Thursday April 18 and sent back to my port of departure (Eindhoven, Netherlands) in the early morning hours of April 19, Good Friday.

&amp;#x200B;

I hold a full Dutch residence permit, and was travelling to Dublin, Ireland. My original flight was a direct Eindhoven - Dublin trip, but due to overbooking on the Airline (which I won't name at this point), I was denied boarding and given a rerouting free of charge through Stansted.   
Upon being given this routing, I asked to check if I was allowed to travel without a UK visa through Stansted. I was told yes from the Airline customer service, and that I could follow up with both Airport and Airline officials at Eindhoven when I arrived at EIN airport.  
Upon arrival at the airport, I insisted that Eindhoven officials call the Airline Immigration office to check the route was compatible with my travel documents. They did, and were told by the immigration manager there (of the Airline), that I was okay to board. This information was incorrect. I boarded the flight and was assured everything was okay.   
Upon arrival at Stansted, I was detained for 15 hours, interviewed, all belongings searched, my biometrics were taken, my photograph was taken, and then I was deported, and given a refusal-of-entry stamp on my passport.   
I have gone back to Eindhoven and collected all the information to build a case against the Airline (and their immigration department in particular) for giving incorrect travel advice to Eindhoven airport officials, and by extension assuring me that it was okay to board when in fact I had absolutely no entry clearance whatsoever.  
I have contacted the South African embassy in the Hague. I have not received response yet, but hope they will stand by me and support me in this fiasco. I don't know what the consequences are of having a denial-of-entry stamp but it was completely not my fault. In fact, when I got back to Eindhoven, I insisted that an official there call English Immigration directly to confirm that I should never have been given the green light to board by the Airline Immigration officials (or re-routed via Stansted in the first place by the Airline). English immigration confirmed that Airline Immigration acted in error.

&amp;#x200B;

I have documents proving the advice that was given to Eindhoven airport officials. I also have documents proving that Eindhoven supplied all necessary and complete information to the Airline before a decision was made. I have the name of the Airline immigration manager who gave the go-ahead, I have the boarding pass that clearly states: ""OK TO BOARD"" and I have the internal documents that state ""CALLD IMMIGRATION. SOUTH AFRICAN PP WITH DUTCH RESIDENCE CARD -- OK TO STANSTED"".

&amp;#x200B;

I did not leave that airport until I had acquired scans of every document I could. I have scans of all internal documents with respect to my trip. I even have an email sent from the Airline Immigration Manager to the Manager of the Visa Check at the Airport saying ""Yes he can travel without a visa through UK if he has Dutch residence card hence my advice yesterday."" --&gt; which is false.

&amp;#x200B;

At this point, I have taken the following steps: 

Made an official, strongly worded complaint to the Airline (and attached a name of a customer service rep who I spoke with for easier follow up)

I have contacted my embassy

I have contacted the British Home Office who runs the border force that detained me. Not with a complaint, but simply an explanation of what happened and why I was there, similar to above)

I have also sent a strongly worded complaint to the Airport, strategically knowing that the Airport will likely shift blame to the Airline when they see the docs and add pressure.

&amp;#x200B;

I GOT CUSTODY!!!","[Here's my original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/b3rfty/wa_my_father_and_step_mother_died_leaving_me_19m/)

So after one of the most stressful months of my life, I can happily tell you all that I got custody of my sister.

I did as many of you suggested and got a family lawyer who was one of the most kind and helpful people I've ever met in my life. I told her the circumstances of my step mom and dad's death through tears and sobbing, and then told me she'd do everything she possibly could to help me.

After my step sisters bio dad was informed that I would be trying to get full custody, he basically folded within hours. The lawyer told me that it wouldn't have mattered anyway though. She said that because he hadn't visited her for such an extended period of time that it was considered ""abandonment"" in the eyes of the law, and the likelihood of him specifically getting custody was unlikely because of this. 

After her bio dad said he didn't want my step sister, I then spent weeks and weeks filing out the right papers and seeing the right people. I've never signed so many things in my entire life. Because my step sister had no biological family other than her shit-head dad, I was given custody on a silver platter, according to my lawyer.

Her bio dad didn't ask for visitation rights, and it appears he didn't even care in the first place, he just wanted my step sister for no reason other than to further upset me.

Yesterday, I signed the last piece of paper that confirmed that I had 100% custody of my step sister. After I signed, we both cried and cried for hours. We're both working on processing the death of her mom and my dad. As I write this, she's asleep next to me with her head on my shoulder.

The past two months have hands down been the worst of my entire life. I consider meeting my step sister the best that's ever happened to me, and adopting her is one of the best decisions I've ever made. These events have made me realise that family isn't just DNA based, it's actionable investments in the life of someone you love.

Thank you so, so, so much for all of the people who helped me in my first thread. I owe all of you for the rest of your lives. Once I turn 21, if any of ya'll are in the Aberdeen area, drinks are on me. 

I hope you all lead wonderful lives. Give your loved ones a big hug for me.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/beuf9y/update_my_father_and_step_mother_died_leaving_me/,legaladvice,35337,4,0.0
LetMeLyv,2019-04-18 14:27:32+00:00,My mom sold a dog under a contract that had a non breeding agreement and the lady bred the dog,"So long story, around like 2 years ago my mom sold a dog to this lady under a non breeding agreement. This lady bred the dog a little while ago around Christmas and tried to hide it from my mom and of course she found out. 

The contract says that she owes us $1500 per puppy born. It also says that breaking the contract costs 5x the original puppy price (the price we sold the dog for two years ago). And that she covers legal fees and whatever else. It also says that if any part of the contract is broken, that my mom or an agent my mom sends can come and take the dog back. 

So two days ago, my mom sent this guy over to get the dog. (Another break in the contract because the dog was supposed to stay with the lady unless she had written consent from my mother). From my knowledge, everything went smoothly and the guy who had the dog gave the dog and the two puppies that he still had. He had been the one taking care of the dog and had been the one raising the puppy. There were also pictures of the dog on the guys Facebook of the dog looking very under weight and skinny (another break in the contract). He had been selling the puppies on Kijiji for around $200-500 and was selling them as young as around 2 weeks old. 

The lady we sold the dog to called the police and said we had broken into her house and stolen her dog. The police found out that she was lying and that the dog is legally ours. She also said that she never signed a contract but we have the contract signed and she was given her own contract. 

My mom doesn’t want to go to court because the lady is on permanent leave from work so she only gets $1000 per month. I told her that she should try and take her to court but my mom thinks that the judge won’t make the lady pay anything and my mom will have to pay court fees. 

Should my mom take the lady to court? Or should she just let it go?",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/bem6t8/my_mom_sold_a_dog_under_a_contract_that_had_a_non/,legaladvice,4357,283,0.0

After 2 hours of waiting they let him back in and heard our case. Within 30 seconds I handed the judge the contract between myself and his company and she dismissed the whole thing. He said he anticipated this to the judge, which to me means this was a frivolous lawsuit since he named me and my wife, who had to miss work that day. He said he didn’t do it under the business entity so he could not have to use a lawyer. Then he asked if I would be liable for any lawyers fees if he did use one. She said no.

I have recurrent issues with a pilonidal cyst, which I’ve had surgery on twice before within the last five years.  This year, back in February, my GP recommended something called a “bascom flap procedure.”  She refers me to a surgeon, the meeting goes well, and the surgeon schedules me for surgery on April 24th.  


About a month later, I get a call from Kaiser saying that surgeon is actually double booked that day and can no longer do the surgery, but that another surgeon can on April 4th.  It takes some serious finagling, but I’m able to get the time off work and my mom books a ticket to fly into the state to come help me with my recovery.  HOWEVER, on April 2nd I receive another phone call from scheduling saying that this second surgeon doesn’t perform this bascom flap surgery, and that they will have to reschedule me for the next week, on April 11th.  Work is understanding, and my mother was able to rebook her flight for a $150 dollar fee, although she lost about $500 on a non refundable airbnb due to the short notice cancellation.


April 11th comes around and I check into the hospital at 1:30 for my 4pm surgery.  Everything appears to be going smoothly, I receive an IV as well as some gabapentin, Tylenol, and a scopolamine patch behind my right ear.  Throughout the next 3 hours, I repeatedly ask nurses and the anesthesiologist to confirm that I will be receiving the correct procedure, I see it listed on my patient consent form, etc.


At 3:30 the anesthesiologist comes and meets with me, discusses the specifics of his portion of the procedure, and tells me that they are just readying the OR and they will be ready to wheel me in at any moment.  He leaves, nurse checks up on me one more time, and at this point the surgeon comes in to speak with me and my mother.  He asks me about my medical history, and eventually gets to the point— he doesn’t know how to perform my fucking procedure.  Not only that, but he doesn’t know of any surgeons in my immediate area that do.  

We talk for about 10 minutes in total, most of which my mother got on video.  He offers to perform another procedure on me, even though I have already had that procedure and it was not successful for me.  He also tells me he’s going to call his department heads and find out how all this happened, which didn’t feel like much of a consolation to me.  It’s at this point I am discharged with basically zero information, with my scopolamine patch and ekg patches still on.

I am not a litigious person, and I know Kaiser is a behemoth, but my mother lost well over 1000 dollars on this trip, and I have missed work because of it as well, not to mention the billing for all my appointments leading up to this and the 5000 dollar copay.

In late March the MPO hadn't been approved yet and my husband came home from underway on a Monday. Thanks was uneventful because we had a friend over. But Tuesday night he came home and was pissed about the MPO his command had informed him we were seeking and badly hurt my arm in anger while I was nursing our infant. In the morning when he was gone and it was safe to do so o called the police and they came and made a report. They didn't arrest him and said my injuries weren't sufficient for an arrest but at least I got the report. Luckily that same day my advocate at the family advocacy program called me and FINALLY got the MPO approved for 30 days. My husband immediately broke it by emailing me a threatening email saying I would regret this and he had nothing left to lose. Because of this, my advocate spoke to the Navy Marine Relief Corps Society and requested on my behalf that they fly me to my mom. I consulted with an attorney first who advised the same thing.

So on March 23 we flew to Hawaii. I stayed at a DV shelter for two weeks during which I was able to get a TRO against my husband. I asked for a continuance at the hearing to give time to serve him and my next hearing is in June. My time at the DV shelter was only for two weeks and then we were staying in a tent on my mom's patio, but were told by her landlord she would get evicted if we stayed.

A Redditor came to the rescue and lent us 500, which with what I had on my own was enough to pay first months rent on a place.

We now have SNAP, TANF, a house, a car that was donated to us by a loving woman, and have the ball rolling on getting child support.

I am in contact with his command. His MPO is up on May 1 but other than the first threatening email he hasn't contacted me, although he did send some threats to my oldest son's cell phone. I am currently looking for work but I'm doing okay.

I want to say I understand why some women don't leave. The police didn't arrest him. Can you freaking believe that. His command took far to long to get the MPO. We ended up homeless for almost a week. It's been terrifying and overwhelming. But we are safe. And now we can begin to heal and rebuild.

I could not have done this without the overwhelming support and outpouring of love I've gotten on here. Thank you everyone for the encouragement, resources, advice and friendship.

[Original Post here](https://amp.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/b2mi6a/nc_sold_them_a_used_car_now_they_sued_me_over_it/)

This morning we had our court date, and let me tell you it was pretty quick. Got in at 8:32, out by 8:50. The plaintiff presented her case, in which she said that we hadn’t disclosed an airbag light that was on the dash, and that the check engine light code we told them about was false information because it actually turned out to be another issue. Said the vehicle had more rust than they originally knew about, and that they hadn’t driven it because a mechanic told them it was unsafe to drive. 

We presented our defense, clearly stating they had the opportunity to have the vehicle checked by a mechanic, but chose to take our word for it; and that we brought all known faults to their attention prior to selling them the vehicle. Anything they found after they took ownership wasn’t our issue anymore, they had all chances to make a proper decision prior. We brought up the FTC’s Private Sale guide stating that all cars sold from private party to private party are “as-is” unless otherwise stated. We neither expressed nor implied any warranties. 

Long story short, the Magistrate dismissed the case with prejudice to the Plaintiff  because NC is a “Buyer Beware State” and the buyer should have done all in their power to make an informed decision before purchasing the vehicle. They have 10 days to appeal, but I doubt that’s gonna happen. 

Thanks to everyone that commented and gave my wife and I more information on the original post. It sure helped!

I calmly stepped outside onto the front porch to speak to them. As I walked outside, the young cop that was knocking asked me “Are y’all the potsmokers?”

I replied “no sir”, which for that day was true. My girlfriend and I have been struggling with money so we had not been buying weed but our house did have multiple pieces of paraphernalia in it. 

He claimed that he and his older partner were responding to a domestic call that they received from the residents of apartment C. We live in Apartment C. Obviously we didn’t call the police in ourselves. 

I tried to respond to him but as I was speaking, he reached down and opened my front door and barged right in, without any discussion of a warrant or anything like that. When I began to ask questions such as “How can you enter my house without a warrant?” and “Can I have your badge numbers?” they locked me outside and said that if I spoke or tried to enter the house that they would throw me in jail.

They came in the house and saw a bunch of old bongs sitting in our kitchen and put them in a box as evidence. Then they hassled my girlfriend, threatening her with jail time if she don’t comply completely. Originally, we both were only getting a paraphernalia charge, but the cop who kept telling me to “Shut the fuck up or you’re going to jail” because I was asking questions, told his partner that I was outside being disorderly, and that “he was going to add a possession charge for that” and sure enough I alone got the possession charge in addition to the paraphernalia. 

Now we’re stuck in the situation that we are facing thousands of dollars of fines and court costs, while we’re already struggling financially.

I am that vindictive because she cheated on me and I found out one of the kids is not mine. Although that part does not matter. I still love him as mine. I just hate my wife. 

I am wanting to change my will to where my kids get everything. 

Doctors give me about two to three months and the court appt is in September. I will be dead before the divorce gets finalized without her knowledge. 

Is there a way I can keep it this way so the will takes priority?

Riviera_Sunset,2019-04-14 16:36:29+00:00,Mom scammed Dad,"I don’t even know where to start with this. My parents are elderly and have been married for over 60 years. We thought they were financially comfortable- Dad had a significant inheritance from his family. He also worked hard to build his own successful business from scratch which he sold his interest in to a business partner when he retired for a significant sum. Mom never worked but she managed the household - cooking, cleaning, sewing, etc....and she took care of the finances. Mom has long had a compulsive buying problem. It’s a bit of a hoarder situation (the house is mostly livable except for one bedroom which is piled with junk and she filled up a large storage trailer outside) but we thought they could afford it and it was just an eccentricity. Otherwise lived pretty simply - driving cars until they wore out and living in the same simple house for 60 years. They gave generous presents (typically $100 to their children and grandchildren for birthdays and Christmas) but nothing extravagant. 

Mom had a fall a few weeks ago and ended up in the hospital with a broken hip which required surgery. While she has been in the hospital, Dad started opening the mail. Mom had always been the one to get the mail. Dad realized that he is basically broke. Their bank account was overdrawn by a few thousand dollars, they had several credit cards with high balances, and their retirement investment accounts were almost empty. At first we thought Mom had fallen for some sort of scam. But we started helping Dad go through paperwork which was covering the dining room table and realized that Mom had been falsifying statements for the investment account. The forgery wasn’t particularly good but it showed a balance of over a million dollars, and that’s what Dad thought they had. We dug through old papers in the storage shed and found that she had been doing this at least since 1991. It may have been going on longer but that is the oldest falsified statement we found. We confronted Mom about falsifying statements and she admitted to it. 
Additionally, we just found that she recently cashed in her and Dad’s life insurance policy. She forged Dad’s signature on those papers. She also recently pawned almost all of her jewelry. We don’t know the actual value of the jewelry but she received $17,000 from the pawn shop, so I’m sure that’s only a fraction of the actual value. We ran a background check and found out that they have at least $100,000 in credit card debt. 

We found several years of credit card statements and those purchases all seem normal. We aren’t sure exactly where all the money went. We haven’t confronted Mom about this just yet because she just had surgery this week. We speculate that perhaps she was day trading. She used to watch CNBC all day and keep meticulous notes about stocks. 
Dad is heartbroken, but he still loves Mom. He just doesn’t know what to do. We are all in shock and never expected anything like this had been going on for such a long time. We have opened his own bank account and moved his social security and other residual payments to be deposited in that account which only he has access to. He owns a fair amount of land which he could sell off to cover the debts, but we are at a loss on how else to move forward. If we pressed charges against Mom, I don’t think we would be able to recover any of the lost money, but would the life insurance company be able to reinstate Dad’s policy if it was fraudulently closed? Any other advice? They live in Texas by the way.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/bd4l3o/mom_scammed_dad/,legaladvice,4941,131,0.0
epilepsyinprison,2019-04-14 13:16:22+00:00,"My brother has severe Autism, ID and tonic-clonic seizures and is in a Alabama County Jail where they refuse to give him medication.","My parents were his care giver but they passed away in a car accident a year ago  and I had to take over. I am 24 and he is 21. I am working on getting him into a home for people more suited to care for him but it is slow going. Last time he was institutionalized he went downhill fast and nearly died from refusing to eat. He hates being out of his element and he doesn’t understand needing to adjust. I have papers from his doctors. He has severe autism with ID and can’t be left alone. He will repeat things and mimic what people say. He also has epilepsy and has long lasting tonic-clinic seizures. They are some what controlled by medication but he often needs an emergency medication because they sometimes run longer than 5 to 10 min. It is diastat that is given rectally. 

Yesterday, he wandered off and took some things from a store. When officers came he put up a fight. He is tall and massive because he loves to work out but he hates to be touched.  He has a medical alert that says call me because he has autism and seizures that he wears but no one looked at it. They took him in.  He has a tracker but I didn’t notice and get there quick enough. 

I tried to bring papers to the jail but they said they have to have their medical professionals assess him. They have yet to do that. He has had three seizures so far. He needs his medicine. He is refusing to eat because he has an issue with consistency. He doesn’t seem to know what is going on and he has admitted to things he couldn’t possibly ever have done. He keeps fighting people who try to touch him. 

I talked to the store and offered to pay them for the items but they said this wasn’t there doing. It was the police because he resisted and swung at the officers. 

He is obviously ID. I am not sure how they could talk to him and not know. He can’t write his name. He can’t spell it. He rocks back and forth all the time and speaks to himself. 

One of the country jail staff seems sympathetic because they help me with getting information and call me when he has a seizure but there is only so much they can do.  They just call a tech every time he has a seizure who checks his blood pressure and breathing after and apparently doesn’t see any issue with any of this. He gets asked if he is okay and he says “okay” but he just repeats what people say. It is pretty much what he does other than when he demands things like I a particular food.  I am scared another inmate will notice and take advantage of him. 

I feel awful that I wasn’t looking and he wandered off. This is my fault. 

What do I do? Obviously he shouldn’t steal things but he doesn’t actually know you shouldn’t. They can’t take a confession from him right? Since he just says what people want him to say? 

Would a lawyer be able to get him medication? If someone asks him if he is guilty he will say whatever they want him to say. He does that. He repeats and loves to people please. He isn’t even his own guardian. I am. I have no idea what I am doing.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/bd2mxy/my_brother_has_severe_autism_id_and_tonicclonic/,legaladvice,1810,71,0.0

trinketfox,2019-04-14 01:26:12+00:00,Neighbors are trying to control the road in front of their house. Virginia,"This has been going off and on for two and a half years. I live in Virginia. I am a 20ish woman and live with my 50ish parents and late teenaged brother.

About two and a half years ago I had to move back in to my parents house because my partner and I broke up and I couldnt afford rent. The first day I moved in, a white truck followed me down the road about three minutes after, stopped in front of our house, the men inside stared for a bit, went down a little further and turnwd around. I thought it was strange, and my dad swore under his breath at the sight of them. Apparently our neighbors on ""the turn"" do it every time they see a new vehicle in our neighborhood. They go find where its parked, and tell the driver they were going too fast. 

Apparently before they had moved in and asked everyone if they could drive slowly because they have kids. Thats cool. My parents understood. Then it turned into pestering every other week about driving too fast. My dad politely informed him that the speed limit is 25, and our family goes 15-20 mph. This guy says he knows we go faster and it's way too fast.

It came to a head when my mom drove home from her college class one night, around 11pm. This guy followed her home and confronted her on the porch. She told him to fuck off, but he was clearly drunk or high (driving 5 miles under the speed limit is too dangerous, but under the influence is A okay). She went in and got my dad, who in no uncertain terms told him its never okay to follow a woman home at 11 pm, and that if he ever did it again our neighbor would have my dad to deal with. He also informed him that his and his family were to never set foot on our property again. 

That's why they stopped when they realized I lived with my dad and they were afraid to give me ""the talk"". 

I wish that was the end of it. They claim its because of their kids, but who lets their toddler play in the road at 11 at night? He has a company vehicle, and his daughter (the mother of the kids), has a nice car. I think they dont like the dust from the dirt road. Hes frequently out spraying the road with his garden hose, like four times a week at least. My dad says apparently they have a chemical you can mix and spray to cut down the dust? Anyway, they eventually called our hoas security on everyone on the road for speeding. Its a small town, the security guy is related to my dad somehow, and asked for the real story. He went back and informed our neighbor that the speed limit was 25, deal with it, no one is breaking any law but him by following people home. 

About a year ago, his daughter decided she was going to take matters into her own hands. I was driving around the turn, and she was coming the opposite way in her nice little car. I slowed down to get over because its a narrow road. She jerked it over onto my side, and I had to go halfway into the grass just to avoid the collision. I was bewildered, stopped, and she refused to move. She rolled down her window and starts screaming obscenities and telling me she was sick of me driving too fast. Her kid was in the front seat, by the way. I wasnt ready to deal with a family that followed my car home, so I rolled up my window and drove my car all the way onto the grass and around her. Then went to work. I immediately bought dash cams for myself and my family and had it installed before I drove home. I told my dad what had happened and everyone got the dash cams installed. We talked about it and decided the best course of action would be to wait until we had footage, because we had no proof of what had happened. Afterward they would scream and waive their arms every time we drove by. My mom called security anyway and they stopped their antics for a while. 

They have a bloodhound too. During the calm, I drove by and it was running loose. They let it out all the time and I'm afraid to walk my dog anywhere near. I slowed down to a roll not to hit it, and I had my window down and my arm out of the window. It jumped up and tried to snap at my arm. I dont slow down for that dog any more. It scares me and I keep my windows up. I still avoid it tho, because its not the dogs fault his owner is an idiot. 

Anyway, two nights ago they started again. I was coming home and one of them had just pulled out. My car has been in the shop, so I borrowed our little used SUV. It was dark, but I believe it was the daughter. They backed out into the middle of the road, and I stopped to give them time to finish. Then she parked it in the middle again and sat there. The cab light turned on because she was opening the door. I slowly (very slowly) took the SUV into the ditch and drove around because I refuse to deal with that crazy. To be clear, she hadnt gotten out, and I gave the widest radius I could. I was still on my side and nowhere near hitting her. And being the little used SUV it was the one. Fricken. Vehicle. That didnt have a dash cam (now amended). 

Yesterday my parents and brother were driving by and they were standing by the road. They went ballistic and just started screaming, trying to get them to pull over and wave them down.

No one in my family has ever had to call the police for more than a fender bender or minor property damage. How should we proceed? I doubted myself at first, so I now watch my speedometer. I'm always going about 15. Ive watched my parents too. They do the same. My brother does about 20, and I have fussed at him for the kids sake, but we certainly aren't going over the speed limit.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/bcxqvd/neighbors_are_trying_to_control_the_road_in_front/,legaladvice,1372,94,0.0

Fatgirlisntana,2019-04-12 22:26:21+00:00,[GA] Got a VERY bad haircut at a well known salon. As my hair is directly tied to my income is it worth it to contact a lawyer?,"Right off the bat, I understand that other people have much bigger problems then this, and I know that hair grows back. Sorry if this post is all over the place. 

I know no one one Reddit can give me all the answers but I’m wondering if this is something worth pursuing or not. 

I also know that there are a ton of points where I should I should have said stop and asked for another stylist but I’ve never had a bad experience with these people and I’m kind of shy about speaking up. 

I had very long, healthy hair (down to my ass) that I’ve been growing out for 3+ years.  My hair is directly tied to my income, I’m a (hair) model and I’d say I’m probably looking at losing about $5-10,000 depending on what gigs I can still do with extensions (these are jobs booked specifically because of my hair up until the end of this year as well as paid social media advertisements). This isn’t including income I would have made booking other gigs for the rest of the year (I made $30,000 last year in mostly jobs tied directly to my hair). 

A week ago, I went into a well known and reputable salon for a 2-3 inch TRIM. This isn’t a Great Clips or Sports Clips type situation, this is a well known, expensive salon. The amount I wanted off was specified both when I made the appointment, in the notes at the front desk, and when the stylist was cutting my hair. 

I have a normal go-to stylist there but on the day of my appointment she was out sick. I was assigned a new stylist instead (I wasn’t notified at the time that they were brand new to the salon and this was their first job out of school). Everything went well with the cut, but after they finished blow drying I noticed it was uneven (like a two or three inch difference). I pointed it out and they immediately apologized and went to fix it (first red flag, should have asked for someone else). At this point I was angled away from the mirror. Halfway through they went to ask the manager a question which I now realize was related to the cut and not just a general question (second red flag). I looked in the mirror and my hair was at least 5 inches off (probably more) at this point. This was probably when I really should have stopped them, but once again I had faith in the salon and five inches wasn’t a huge deal because my hair was so long. When they came back I specifically asked NO shorter and just keeping it as long as possible at that point. 

I was facing the mirror and they were working on the back and I just hear her mutter “crap” under her breath. I immediately told her to stop and show me the back. I have NO clue for the life of me how but a large chunk of my hair was chopped to the base of my NECK. I asked to speak to a a manager and I was in tears at this point. 

The manager was really kind and explained she was new. But when I started crying she was rather rude saying “it’s JUST hair it will grow back, you don’t need to be making a scene” things along that line. I was really panicked at this point. She offered to have their senior master stylist come in to fix it the next day but I wanted nothing to do with her at that point, asked for a hair tie and left. 

The next day I went to my moms hairstylist who cut my hair when I was younger and he was shocked. He said that in his experience a salon of that caliber shouldn’t have someone who would eff up that bad and he’d ask around. He also mentioned the possibility of me trying to sue that salon. I just wanted him to fix it and he did a fairly good jo by cutting my hair into a v-shape, but it would  be considered a long bob and in no way the style I have bookings for or the style that gets me jobs generally.  

Then today my moms stylist called me back (he’s been doing my families hair for years and is a good friend) and said he had heard from a pretty reputable source that the stylist was the child of either the general manager or owner of that salon and wasn’t qualified to work there. He said I should most definitely pursue legal action and that if this had happened in his salon the owner would already be making me offers. 

The original salon has not called me back at all, but I was fairly rude leaving. 

Question is, is this worth pursuing? I feel like any lawyer will laugh at me because it’s just hair. I’m also really young and still working on my undergrad so this isn’t a full time career. I just don’t know what to do at this point.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/bcjp7x/ga_got_a_very_bad_haircut_at_a_well_known_salon/,legaladvice,6724,176,0.0

They've been watching her for months.","The maintenance workers in our apartment complex have always lingered outside our door since we moved in back in September of last year. We've had a few tickets put in for minor repairs on some appliances, and the first two times they came, they always knocked because the deadbolt was locked, even though they tried to enter without any prior notification.

2ndOfficerCHL,2019-04-12 09:19:36+00:00,"Agreed to front money for a trip that had to be cancelled, now friends are refusing to pay the non-refundable costs (New York)","Let me preface this by saying that I'm not sure if my grievance has any legal standing, but I have evidence of it in the form of texts and Facebook messages.

Last year, three friends and I attempted to plan a week-long vacation abroad to Iceland, where they had been before but I had not. 

Two of them were fresh out of grad school and I was currently earning the biggest wage out of the four, so I agreed to book the flights and Airbnb house on the promise of reimbursement for their shares. This was to have taken place in the fall of 2018.

Prior to the trip taking place, one of them informed me that she had changed jobs in the interim and had not accrued enough leave time to make the trip. Another told me that his boss had demanded that he chair a meeting that coincided with the trip, and threatened his promotion if he took the leave time. The third would not agree to come if their boyfriend (the second one) wasn't coming. 

So one by one they dropped out, after I had already spent some $2,800 in bookings. In spite of this, they assured me that they'd still recompense me the loss, since I was forced to cancel the whole thing, not wanting to travel solo to a place I had no experience in. 

Airbnb fortunately refunded me most of the money, but the airline would only offer me non-transferrable credit with hefty rebooking fees and a strict time limit, which rendered the credit more or less useless. I wound up visiting the UK in February and plan to visit again this summer, but the airline that holds the credit doesn't offer a viable UK itinerary that I can use.

So it's been roughly seven months since the trip was due to take place, and I'm still owed roughly $1,200. The two who owe the bulk of it are increasingly avoiding me, in spite of their repeated promises to pay me back. I understand that their bosses were inflexible, if that's indeed what happened, but the deal was always that they would pay me back, trip or no trip.

I'm wondering if I have any legal avenues to pursue recompense if they continue to kick the can over this, and whether or not text and Facebook messages are admissible evidence in this situation.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/bcbh4i/agreed_to_front_money_for_a_trip_that_had_to_be/,legaladvice,5591,114,0.0

1962throwaway,2019-04-11 13:20:09+00:00,[NY] I found out my parents have most-likely been stalking me. What do I do?,"I posted [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/bbnnqn/someone_has_tried_to_impersonate_me_and_those/) yesterday asking for help because I thought someone who may want to hurt me may be impersonating me by sending messages to my contacts, interfering with my relationships, and causing trouble at work.

&amp;#x200B;

After posting, I shared what happened to a small group of people, who started sleuthing through what-ifs. They thought that my ex-boyfriend may be behind the behavior and the app we found, but it didn't add up to me. They suggested that I look through old text messages to see if I could determine where I went that day (e.g., if I had met up with him and he had access to the phone). I used my Google Location data to find out where I was on the date and time of the app installation, and it turns out I was at my parents' house.

&amp;#x200B;

Suddenly, most of these things make sense. My dad has a history of financial interference and abuse.  Three years ago, he opened a series of credit cards in my name, maxed them out, and refused to pay. He ruined my credit. My mother begged me not to go to the police, so I didn't. Instead, I paid them off and worked very hard to rebuild my credit. He promised to pay me back and has not paid a dime to this day. 

 My parents have both expressed discontent with me considering my former landlord ""family"". They were quite vocally upset when I broke from the shared family phone plan, and opened a new plan with two of my sisters. They blamed me for influencing those sisters (who are both adults) to move out on their own. They are very conservative Muslims who disagree with my lifestyle. I feel as if they tried to interfere so that I would have no one left, and have no choice but to come home to them, as moving home until I get married is something that they've begged me to do for years.

&amp;#x200B;

What legal recourse should I take now? I instructed my sisters to also scan their phones. One of them found similar stalkerware, while the other did not. 

&amp;#x200B;

We have younger siblings who still live at home, so my sisters are hesitant to do anything that may get my parents sent away/harm my younger siblings' relationship to our parents. I, however, do not care what happens to them –– I have forgiven them once before for crossing the line with credit cards, so I do not care what happens to them now.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/bbzsgt/ny_i_found_out_my_parents_have_mostlikely_been/,legaladvice,7437,126,0.0

Things go to shit and we break up. Talk of custody and child support comes up and I tell her I was going to try for custody.

Three hours later I am picked up for questioning. I refuse to answer any questions, get a lawyer after release and find out I have a restraining order against me. 

The kid is born. DNA test is done and its not mine. 

Since all of this started I have been recording all phone calls on my cell phone because CYA has literally saved my job. 

I just got a phone call from an unknown number. It was my ex. She said since she was using a friends phone and wanted to apologise. I told her we should not be talking. She agreed and apologized for lying to the police about the rape. 

I immediately hung up the phone. I have her on recording admitting to false Rape reports to the police. 

Will I get in trouble for this? I made no effort to call her and she called me. The call lated 1:28 seconds and I hung up on her. 

Second question. What are the chances of using this recording to get restraining order dropped?

Third. What are the chances that Dallas police will arrest her for the false claim?",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/bbr17m/tx_my_pregnant_ex_girlfriend_is_told_several_lies/,legaladvice,10867,53,0.0

This one student has been assaulting her daily for weeks.  This kid has a permanent shadow assigned to him to watch him, but when that person goes to the bathroom, this kid will grope my girlfriend's breasts, thighs, hips, spit in her, rip her glasses off, etc.  

Initially, she was told it was her fault for dressing the way she does (completely covered up to her neck with a turtleneck).  Now they just say he's disturbed and she should show compassion.  This kid knows what he is doing, has announced his plans before doing these things, has grabbed a classmate's penis...  

This kid is fucked in the head.  And the school does nothing.  They brought in the dad and he adopted this kid along with a few others and ""has no idea where this behavior is coming from"".  The dad also happens to be good friends of the administration and is in a law enforcement position, which shouldn't matter but might be playing a role since the school shuts this type of behavior down for other students.  

All my girlfriend can do is write this kid up.  They even had someone from the district come in and he just said to show compassion.  This kid is going to grow up and have muscles and end up really hurting someone.  There has to be something that can be done.  This is insanity that this is just what my girlfriend should expect and deal with.

throw-it-away-dammit,2019-04-10 00:29:05+00:00,"[warning: triggers] A hospital therapist raped me. I sued the hospital and reported the therapist, who fled to another state (AL) and began a private practice. I reported him again, finally had his license revoked. But he is still practicing, now as a “pastoral counselor” Can I stop him?","The background:
When I was 20(F), I fell into a severe depression. After months of trying to manage it, I admitted myself into an inpatient psychiatric hospital because I was becoming severely suicidal. For 2 weeks I lived in an inpatient rehab facility and I improved a lot, but I still needed help with depression symptoms. The hospital placed me into their partial hospitalization program so I could transition back to “normal” life but still receive treatment 5 days a week. 

The therapist (40s, M) who ran the partial hospitalization program started telling me that “you need to be shown that you have value” and that my depression could be reversed with exposure to such affirmations. Hindsight is 20/20 but because I trusted the hospital that had already helped me a lot, I listened to this therapist and figured he was telling the other patients the same thing. 

Eventually I ran out of money and had to quit the hospitalization program because I had no insurance. About 2 weeks after discharge, I started feeling very suicidal again and also started receiving emails from the therapist. I ignored him at first. He offered me therapy at his private office, and I caved. I was raped under the guise of “you need this to get better”. 

Obviously I didn’t get better, I got PTSD instead, and I sued the hospital. My lawyer found out the therapist had a felony conviction for voyeurism and his LMFT license was on probation, and the hospital didn’t even run a background check on him. The therapist admitted he “had sex with” me in his deposition. After 2 years of litigation, I won my case against the hospital. I also sued the therapist in the same lawsuit but he claimed to have no money. 

This all happened in Indiana. At the start of the lawsuit, I immediately reported the therapist to the Indiana licensing board. But it turned out that he gave up his license and fled the state, so he could apply for a LMFT or LCSW license in another state without any red flags. He moved to Alabama where he is now. My lawyer filed a complaint with the Alabama licensing board during the lawsuit and his therapy license was revoked.

However, it didn’t stop him. He created a private practice with a website and has a physical office. The lawsuit was over when I found this out, and my lawyer was a disbelieving asshole the entire time, so I immediately filed a complaint myself with the Alabama licensing board, explaining that he assaulted me and should not be giving therapy to anyone. 

Alabama must have taken action because his website was taken down. I thought it was finally over. Now his website is back up, and he’s calling himself a “pastoral counselor”. 

Do I have any legal options to stop this? I’d ask my lawyer but he’s an asshole who is no longer interested in returning calls since the lawsuit settled.

Ornery_Alligators,2019-04-09 12:29:09+00:00,Am I Obligated To Honor Previous “Verbal Agreements” Made From A Business I Inherited?,"I’ll try to keep this as black and white as possible...

I unexpectedly inherited a Marina in NY 3 years ago after the sudden and out of the blue death of a family member.  Over the past 3 years I’ve pretty much been trying to decipher the whole business and put together everything in a way that’s more manageable for me to run.

The biggest issue I’ve had has been; it seems everyone “had a deal” with my family member for a discounted slip (boat parking space) and at first I was honoring those deals as to keep good relations with all the customers.  I found out that a few people have taken advantage of this and stretched the truth and even completely fabricate deals.  Taking advantage of my goodwill and naivety.

With the new season about to begin,  after being burned a few times, I have decided to put my foot down and say any deals that were made under previous ownership will only be honored with a written agreement.  This has made one customer of mine livid and he’s been constantly and inappropriately bothering me about how the deal he made has already been agreed upon.  *Not by me but from my dead family member*.  

I don’t have any written evidence but a long-time employee, who I trust very much, told me recently that the deal the customer made with my family member was only for one year.  He’s now received the same deal (more than half off on a slip in exchange from some old equipment that I don’t even use) for the 4 years (one when my family member was alive, 3 since I took over).  My family member took a ton of notes and seemingly wrote everything on his mind down, either on his phone or in notepads/random pieces of paper.  I haven’t found ANYTHING about this deal.

Trying to take my anger and emotion of being lied to and taken advantage of; I told him for me to continue honoring the deal I need something in writing between the two of them that gives details and dates of the “deal”.  Is this legal?  Do I have to honor deals that I never verbally agreed to? Are there any ramifications that I’m not thinking of by terminating verbal agreements that I had nothing to do with?  What about written ones?  Can I tell him he’s no longer welcome at the marina (contractually I have that right)? Where should I go from here?  He’s essentially dooped me for 5-6 thousand dollars.  I’m just trying to do the right thing, but I don’t want to be taken advantage of or get in any legal trouble.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/bb7cij/am_i_obligated_to_honor_previous_verbal/,legaladvice,5978,106,0.0
GaloreGalore,2019-04-08 22:43:23+00:00,Bra required to be worn in jail?,"Hi, legaladvice. I have a question about the way my sister is being treated after her arrest. She's in CO, at the Grand County jail. First off, she's very sensitive about the subject because of some postpartum depression and general disdain about being in the situation she's in, so I'm trying to help her out. The jail requires female inmates to wear a bra in all common areas outside her cell, which I completely understand. She has been granted permission to pump her milk 5 times a day as needed in the infirmary, and has only had one CO really give her an issue about it. It seems like that one CO is now present more often the last two weeks (schedule change?) and is making remarks toward my sis about writing her up for breaking dress code, and asking why she isn't wearing her jail-supplied bra to and from the infirmary, and so on. The CO has been getting more and more volatile about it, saying that she looks obscene, and making other inflammatory comments, from what I've heard.

&amp;#x200B;

The issue is that the jail issue bra doesn't fit my sister's figure. She was issued a 3X and simply can't get it to fit. Is it fair that she has an extremely large chest and is being singled out for it by this asshole CO? I've been denied visitation with her because she wasn't wearing a bra she can't fit into.

PurportedPangolin,2019-04-06 15:43:01+00:00,"An estate lawyer sent me a rather large inheritance check via USPS. They ""lost"" it YESTERDAY even though it required a signature to deliver. Called estate lawyer this morning. He's saying I already opened an account with the check. It's been less than 24 hours. I need some help.","Ok, here's the explanation. The mail carrier showed up hours early yesterday. Usually they are here at about 5 or 6 pm. Yesterday, knowing that I had certified mail coming I waited all day. He was early and I was caught off guard. Ran out the front door like a bat out of Hades. By the time I got up to the road he had left a little pink slip and drove off. 

&amp;#x200B;

I found it odd how early he was and that it was a completely different guy than normal. The pink slip said to pick up the mail at the post office today. 4/6/2019.

&amp;#x200B;

Went to the post office this morning and they could not locate my mail. The did not have it at the offices, they called whomever is delivering today and he said he does not have it. They don't know where it is and take my name and number. Here's where things get wonky.

&amp;#x200B;

I called the lawyers office as soon as I got home this morning. Let them know what was going on and to cancel/reissue the check and I would be willing to come pick it up in person. I'm told they have to call me back. When they call me back they tell me I have already cashed and deposited the check. UM EXCUSE ME?! NO THE HELL I HAVE NOT. An argument ensues. I'm told to call back on Monday to talk to one of the other estate lawyers in the firm.

&amp;#x200B;

Then I talk to my sister, who was also an heir and had already received her check a couple of weeks ago. The check was not only handwritten she said, but she did NOT have to sign for it AND along with the check, in non-certified snail mail, was a sheet of paper with a copy of her id, her birth-date and her social security number on it. For tax purposes they said.

&amp;#x200B;

So BASICALLY, checks for tens of thousands of dollars were handwritten by this estate lawyer and then sent out via unprotected snail mail, with the recipients personal information just printed out for anyone risky enough to open someone elses mail. Everything you need to open an online account. Including the routing number on the check itself. Between 2 pm yesterday and 8 am this morning? Someone got my check, opened an online account under my name with my information and I'm now being told that there is nothing anyone can do about it.

&amp;#x200B;

I still have the pink missed delivery notice that I did not sign. I physically went to the post office. Plenty of people saw me and there were cameras everywhere. Now this post office is in pretty bad shape. Run down and everyone that works there is angry and nasty at all times. So I don't know if the cameras even work but I'm pretty sure they would never release camera footage without some kind of warrant. The people working there are barely willing to bother selling you a book of stamps. They aren't going to go out of their way to help me without some kind of legal intervention. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm basically broke. I was waiting on this money to pay off my medical bills. I thought to myself ""FINALLY"" I will be able to get the help I need, pay off what I owe and maybe get back to living life. Now it looks like all I'm going to get is a long drawn out fight, which will ultimately eat up the inheritance I thought I was getting. 

&amp;#x200B;

I mean, by the time all this is over, I may not even be alive. That is not an exaggeration.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what my options are, when a lawyer is telling me there is nothing any lawyers can do about it, including him. Surely there's something I can do? Like do I call the police? A different kind of lawyer? I have never in my life had to deal with anything like this.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry if this is the wrong place to pose this question. I'm feeling pretty desperate at the moment.

These are VERY powerful, VERY fast lights that you can not avoid walking by.

poksoooosoo28,2019-04-03 20:39:00+00:00,"Neighbors child has disabilities and won't stop climbing the fence, entering my house and ""freeing"" my dogs","For the past 7 months after moving in to my new house with my daughter and dogs the neighbors child who's 15/16 and has pretty severe downs syndrome has increasingly been entering my property and home.

At first I just talked to the neighbors and they were at first really sorry and vowed to monitor her more while she's in their backyard. However after a few months they just genuinely do not care anymore and brush it off.

I've installed security cameras in the backyard and front yard purely for my own safety insurance wise because we do have a pool. 

She will climb the fence into my yard (6' wooden privacy fence) with a ladder from their shed and let my dogs out. I've fixed her letting my dogs ""free"" as she says by using chains and padlocks on the two gates. Before this became a common occurrence she even would let the dogs out of the house and then ""free"" them. 

Numerous times if my garage door is open she will leave their backyard and just walk into my house to free my dogs. I don't know what the purpose is other than it's something she just has to do for whatever reason.

When she climbs into the backyard (sometimes when I'm not even home) and she cannot get back out she begins screaming and crying and just shuts down. Before I started chaining and locking my gates because of her releasing my dogs her parents would just walk in and get her and leave. Now since I've chained it they start a huge fit about me having her locked in my backyard and they have to climb the fence, bring the ladder over and carry her back over. Somehow this is my fault.

Now I'm not really blaming her because she mentally doesn't know any better, she has some very severe issues and she's damn lucky my dogs are super nice (purebred German Shepard, an English bulldog and a mix Sheppard/bulldog).

I just honestly worry about her safety in the backyard, climbing fences and her seemingly not being watched as she needs to be. I have a pool and if she falls in when I'm not home she could very well drown. That's why I installed security cameras to cover my own ass if that ever happens, I truly hope it never does but it seems her parents just put her in the backyard and that's it.

I've called the local child and family services office (CPS) several times in the past two months to report it because I feel she is at risk with her parents inattentiveness and their seemingly not caring attitude of her just going into people's yards, garages, houses etc. I have a full garage of power tools, table saws etc that I've now had to resort to flipping the breaker off when I open the doors out of fear she may severely injure herself.

I feel like I've done everything I can, talked to the parents numerous times, called child and family services, installed cameras, locked my gates further. I just have no idea what to do now? I've debated calling the police when she enters but I don't know how that will escalate.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/b93dx3/neighbors_child_has_disabilities_and_wont_stop/,legaladvice,18239,353,0.0

He returned and told me ""this car has never been inspected, that sticker is from a Honda Civic (brothers car is 2014 Mazda suv)"" and peeled it off with his fingers. That made me think he wasn't lying, we bought it used from a stranger, but the previous owner revealed that he had the window replaced and when they scraped the sticker off they left some behind. He then ticketed me for speeding, and my brother for no inspection, and fraudulent inspection.

Cut to today, we take the car to the MVC to get inspected. MVC tells us it's still good until August 2019 as we purchased it last August, and the law is that 5 years after model year and purchase it is clear for driving. We have pics of car with old sticker from August 2018 (sticker clearly visible and legible), and the new sticker. We have purchase dates, Carfax, and are hoping to get window repair tab from previous owner.

MVC also told us no way he ""called Trenton"" and found out. All records are kept in exclusively paper for two years in a shed (or some storage) at each private MVC. It would have to go to Trenton, then to the company, then to the individual location, then a guy there would have to find the record and report back all the way to a cop on patrol. So even though he wasted 25-30 min of my time, it would take far longer to accomplish that, and he would have no way of knowing what model car it was attached to.

Also when he pulled me over, I handed him my license, registration and insurance as soon as I could, but mentioned I didn't know where the latter two were so I apologized while searching. He asked whose car it was, I said my brothers to which he immediately responded ""why is his license suspended?"". This caught me off guard, and I now believe he pulled me over thinking he hit the jackpot with my brother driving around. 

Anyways, how effectively can these tickets be fought? Best way and time to file complaint about officer? Can he peel off a sticker like that? I am very upset an officer lied to his teeth to me just to give out tickets, played me like a fool when I was trying to be as cooperative as possible, and that my family has to deal with all this crap.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/b8s2jv/nj_cop_pulled_me_over_claimed_my_inspection/,legaladvice,3428,53,0.0

A few people suggested contacting the law firm on the subpoena which was what I had planned so I contacted them yesterday morning. After not hearing back yesterday I followed up today only to be told they don't get to decide who to send subpoenas to, they get the order from the court and they send it. The law firm suggested contacting the police station to get a copy of the report so I called them immediately after. Now for the big twist, after giving my name and city of residence I was informed that I am listed as the VICTIM of the case and the subpoena is to testify against this woman charged of domestic violence. I've requested a copy of the case report but I don't know where to go from there. At this point I'm fully expecting to have to go to court and tell them I have no idea who this woman is and she certainly did not attack me. Thanks for the people who commented in the original thread and offered advice. I'm not sure if there is anything else I can do at this point to avoid going to court. Would it be helpful to call the court itself and try and explain the scenario or does it all come back to this police report?",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/b8knmj/updatemi_received_subpoena_to_testify_for_woman_i/,legaladvice,4160,78,0.0
ezio009,2019-03-31 17:43:07+00:00,Roommate flushed an expensive family heirloom down the toilet.,"So I’m a Sophomore in college and have been living with a randomly paired roommate who I believe has some form of special needs. If the room is messy he gets into some serious anger fits where he will scream and yell at me about not cleaning up and then proceed to throw all of my stuff around the room. This lasts around 20 minutes and he always apologises profusely and cleans everything up and says it won’t happen again. 

Just yesterday he had another crazy anger fit and took my watch off my desk and flushed it down the toilet and proceeded to scream hysterically. The watch was quite an expensive Rolex passed down from my father from his father so it has a lot of significance within the family. I’ve tried calling the school and sewage system but I’ve had no luck yet in retrieving it. 

I have moved rooms and spoken to the RA but they have not really offered any significant advice. I have not spoken to my roommate yet as I am both too angry and scared to approach him. I have not spoken to my father yet as I know it will complete devastate him. 

I honestly have no idea how to approach this and any help would be appreciate it. What’s the best course of action here?",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/b7qe95/roommate_flushed_an_expensive_family_heirloom/,legaladvice,9431,106,0.0

umwowexcusemewtf,2019-03-30 20:49:46+00:00,My sister is in some weird cult - MI,"No, that is not clickbait and I am seriously very worried about her and all of the other people involved.

Okay. So my sister graduated from high school last year and decided to take a gap year. She came across a Craigslist posting by a woman I'll refer to as Aileen about how she has a farm and she's looking for kids who want life experience, that she'll provide them room and board to work on her farm and how she can teach them all of these great skills. I never saw the ad, but I remember my sister telling me about it at the time. She was very excited, this opportunity was everything she had been looking for she had told me. So she began a correspondence with ""Aileen"". I did not live with my sister, I'm older by 5 years so I was not on the scene when all of this was going down. 

So she ends up going to this place last August, I think, maybe early September. I have only spoken with her through emails since and at first she was happy, everything was good, she was making friends and all of that. I was wondering why she only emailed and she told me there's no phone service on the ranch, ""Aileen"" doesn't believe in phones and she takes them to the library for internet access. That right there was the first time I thought something was a bit off, but my sister was happy so I didn't push it.

Over time, the tone of her emails changed. She would talk about her friends there, the animals, all these activities she was doing, not about ""Aileen"" much. Then it gradually became that ""Aileen"" is all she would talk about. ""Aileen"" was telling her some seriously messed up stuff and if she didn't agree with it, everyone else would ignore her existence until she broke down crying and apologized. ""Aileen"" made her slaughter her favorite chicken, ""Aileen"" said she needed to cleanse herself and wouldn't let her eat solid food for a week. ""Aileen"" made her take drugs. Seriously disturbing stuff. I told her she needed to get out of there, that I'd come pick her up, but she would downplay everything, make excuses for ""Aileen"", say she was over reacting, that it wasn't as bad as she made it seem et cetera. 

I didn't know what to do at that point. I thought something hinky was going on, but at the same time my sister was an adult and I trusted her judgment at the time. It's not like I had anything to go off of, a location, or anything and while disturbing, I didn't think anything super egregious was happening. ""Aileen"" seemed like an eccentric survivalist type, but ultimately harmless. Yes, I was tentatively concerned, is what I'm trying to say, but I felt like my sister was mature and intelligent enough to know when she was in over her head.

My sister emailed me yesterday and I don't feel like that is the case anymore. Something had happened and from what I was able to ascertain, one of the other girls at this place committed some kind of cardinal sin and ""Aileen"" instructed the other kids to beat viciously beat this girl. My sister was forced to participate in this. She seemed distraught about it, but ultimately blamed the girl because she should have known better than to have done what she did. I don't know what she did, my sister wouldn't elaborate on it. 

I stayed up all night pouring over all of her emails, lookings for some clue but I couldn't figure anything out. I know my sister took a Greyhound to Lansing and Aileen picked her up from the bus station, so I think this freak show is probably in either Eaton, or Ingham but as to more specifics, I have no idea. I don't think my sister even knows. I have a hunch they're in, or around Mason because Aileen made the kids spend the night at Seven Gables, but other than that I'm coming up empty.

I know this is a jumbled fucking mess, but I really need to know what to do. How do I handle this situation?  ",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/b7fugm/my_sister_is_in_some_weird_cult_mi/,legaladvice,13589,70,0.0

Whatchagonnadowhen,2019-03-29 04:52:45+00:00,"After I cracked the door, police pushed it open on me (VA, USA) UPDATE","[https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/b5q6ha/after_i_cracked_the_door_police_pushed_it_open_on/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app](Original Post)

Background before yesterday’s post:

So, December 2018, I had a fall and fractured my wrist.  It turns out, when police forced in the door on me, combined with cuffing me, he refractured my wrist.  I’ve attached a report from 3/26, the day, the incident occurred.

So, to summarize:

1) I cracked the door open about 2 inches.

2) 2 police officers, with no paperwork in hand, when I asked “what are the warrants for?”said they’d have to go check.

3) arrived at my door stating I “may have outstanding warrants.”

4) I told them 3 times, In a runaround conversation,   me: “what are the warrants for?”,  and they “we don’t know” and me: “I will call the police station and if I have warrants out I’ll turn myself in”, and they: “no ma’am you need to come with us.”

4) Upon my fourth request for the warrants and statement I’d turn myself in, an officer pushed the door open on my body by force, with my right hand on the door.

5) that same officer, agitated, then cuffed me by force, although I didn’t resist.

6)! During this time, my right wrist was refractured.

7) During this time I was a female in under pants and t shirt, which I had already mentioned to them repeatedly.

8)  I stated I had some warrants three weeks ago but did not mention that I added already been arraigned on the charges (meaning quite a bit of time for the paperwork to update passed I had been arraigned a full week earlier).

9) The officer who forced the door asked for my SSN.  After some calm questions I provided it.

10) After radioing in my info, I was  uncuffed, as it was discovered I had turned myself in 3 weeks before for these warrants.  The officer apologized “it had to go this way.”  I indicated that I’ve been researching my rights as a citizen and I had no idea they could burst in that way.

11) the officers left with polite pleasantries.  

12) shortly after the adrenaline wore off, I noticed the pain in my wrist.  

13) later that say I went to a local medexpress and found my wrist had been refractured.

So, with no warrant and ultimately asking for nothing more than my SSN, officers broke my wrist forcing my door in on me with not a stitch of paperwork allowing them to do so.

I’m beyond angry.  I cannot believe that these cops could behave so egregiously they not only completely ignored the 4th amendment but they basically started me completely over on the healing of my wrist.

If anyone has comments, I guess i should maybe share on r/bola or r/legaladviceofftopic?  Not sure which.

Thanks to all who commented fairly on my original post.

It is a long story but I will keep it brief, I reported my field training officer for not being attentive enough during my training because he was spending so much time talking to other officers.

During this time I was 4 months in, had 0 problems along the way and had excellent critiques during every weekly review.

The day after I reported him, the commander I reported him to goes on a 6 wk vacation.

I come in to work and it's obvious the training is over, my FTO is furious and I don't make it 1 hour into my shift before being pulled.

The next day I come in and receive directed leave papers and am informed I will have a meeting with the Captain.

My meeting with the captain was my dismissal papers. There was no discussion about why I was being let go.

Fast forward two years and I've been working at a job where I need my DOD secret clearance. The process is long and I had my interview with the background investigator yesterday.

When we got to my employment history for the PD it said I do not recommend him for his clearance because he is dishonest, lied multiple times during training and fabricated documents under penalty of perjury.

None of this is true and there were no specifics to these claims. It took me a minute to gather mysef after hearing this because I planned to return to law enforcement.

Hospital took my vitals and made sure I was alive, I was also very intoxicated.  My BAC at the time of admission was .302, so whoever I was with kept feeding me drinks.

I have a rather large bruise on my lower right back, likely from falling somewhere.  I may have also had a concussion, but I’m not sure.

**Old post summary**: my old boss was telling my old team that I was having a ton of issues. I found out my therapist is her husband, but I didn't know how she was finding this out/to what degree each person was doing bad stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

**New developments summary**: There's still a lot of slow/bureaucratic stuff going on, but the most satisfying news is that *my therapist is no longer practicing*. I even saw the space he practiced out of listed as for sale on a real estate website while doing my own house hunting.

&amp;#x200B;

**New developments, continued**: Therapist was chatting about a client (me) to his wife (my old boss) that, it seemed, he really didn't know was his wife's old employee (large company, closely knit but not minuscule industry). I have a very peculiar family dynamic, so I think he talked about that. However, enough bits and pieces of identifying info came up that she suspected it was me. Unbeknownst to him, she found my paper records in his office and dug through them, then thought it was a great idea to tell my old coworkers that I was depressed and had family issues. Neat. One of my coworkers put in her two weeks because of a relocating spouse shortly after, then agreed to write a formal statement of what she heard, which also helped a lot. Understandably, no one else was willing to because the company's already laid off so many people in the last year.

&amp;#x200B;

**Resolution-in-process**: therapist seems to be less in the wrong than I thought he was (though still in the wrong), old boss is still awful. Therapist likely to receive some sort of reprimanding for both talking to his wife about me in that level of detail, as well as insecure recordkeeping. I don't know if he'll practice again.

***Thank you all -*** you were a huge help, and a confidence boost that me complaining about this would actually get it somewhere and not just create more stress in my life.

jarackin,2019-03-27 19:24:26+00:00,Fired on my first day because I wasn’t even supposed to be hired in the first place.,"For reference, this is in Alabama. 

I recently applied for a job online and was contacted for an interview. Afterwards, I felt like I did poorly. I was sort of reaching as far as whether or not I was qualified. So when I got the email with my offer letter I was surprised and very happy. I accepted their offer and put in two weeks notice. The new job is 5 hours from my old one, so I spent those two weeks training a replacement (management knew I was unhappy and promoted the person I suggested) and finding an apartment. 

I got moved up here with a year long lease, and got ready for work. I go through my onboarding and get a badge at the end of the day I’m taken to my new work area where I meet my new supervisor, one of the guy’s who interviewed me. As soon as he sets his eyes on me I can tell he’s confused. He gives me a seat and says he’ll be right back. 45 minutes later he escorts me back to the HR area and leaves me there. 

So the head of HR apologizes to me and explains there was a mixup in the paperwork and somehow my application was sent to be accepted by mistake. So they tell me that I don’t meet their minimum qualifications and they don’t have an available position to put me in, and that my brand new employment has been terminated. Also they’re very sorry for the confusion!

Now I’ve quit my job, they’ve filled my old position, I’ve signed a year long lease on an apartment, used up nearly all my savings to get out of my old lease, and I’m unemployed.

lifeofjuly,2019-03-27 12:39:32+00:00,"During pelvic exam my Dr. rubbed me sexually, not sure what the next step is","My Dr. had acted unprofessionally in the past, but I wasn't sure if it was a cultural difference and I didn't want to jump to alienate him. He told me he had a daughter my age (I was 19, 20 now) and since I had opened up on my first visit with him about my eating disorder and anxiety disorder, he told me he was ""my healer"" as well as my doctor and would be there for me to talk to, to take to dinner if i needed a meal, etc. He was very caring, and he added me on facebook and liked/shared many posts with me on my wall. Again, I made sure I didn't think a lot of it, he seemed like a competent doctor and that's what my main concern was.

Things got a little weird when I saw him a few weeks ago to get my copper IUD removed. He was always very ""huggy"", again chalked it up to social differences, I didn't know Indian culture. But it got weird when during the 2nd hug of the day he made kissing noises, like ""mwuhmwuhmwuhmwuhmwuh"" next to my ear while hugging me. I thought he was like, literally just feeling parent-y over me cus it was a very parent-y sound. Then it got weird when he actually kissed my cheek the 3rd hug of that day. I hadn't seen him for almost a year, and when I told him I had a copper IUD he freaked out and said it could spark autoimmune diseases in me very young and to get it removed ASAP. This was the same appointment I got kissed on the cheek. 

When I was leaving he said to call his office when I'm ready to get a referral to a ""competent OBGYN"" since I was under the impression he didn't do genital work. My mom also sees him and when she had genital concerns he had turned her away. So when I called his office for the referral, I quickly learned he wanted to perform it himself. It would be a ""quick procedure"" that I could walk from shortly after. He had me so nervous about the copper effects that I opted to get it out ASAP a few days later instead of wait weeks at my normal female OBGYN. I felt a little weird about this, so to be safe or whatever my mom came with me to the appointment but it turns out a female nurse had came in with him so my mom just read magazines in the waiting room. 

I got it removed, that went fine, but then he started doing a pelvic exam after. Whatever, pretty normal procedure, I never mind being examined or tested since I worry a lot about my general health. He's doing the fingering and pressing thing and asking me ""does this hurt? does this hurt?"" in many various places while pressing and fingering, but not sexually, I've had pelvic exams before. It immediately turned sexual when on the 5th ""does this hurt?"" he rubbed my clit with his thumb. It was so subtle and so private that I don't think the female nurse could ever have seen it. Even if my mom was there no one would have seen it. It was completely blocked by his body. I  just froze, I felt so upset, I still feel disgusted and sad. 

I still feel low and I'm not sure I want a lot of drama about this but I feel like I should do something..? I thought about confronting him but it's my word against his and it'd probably fail on file to even matter. I just worry about if he does this to other girls, maybe even his nurses. Should I just file a complaint and switch doctors? What would you recommend I do?

I'm an undergrad student so I wasn't at this presentation. I had several students contact me and send me a photo of the slide asking me if I knew about it (I did not). My own department that I pay tens of thousands of dollars to attend publicly shamed and embarrassed me to hundreds of classmates behind my back.

Would this qualify as defamation of character? I don't feel that it's worth taking legal action, but I'd like to let them know that I could. I don't want to just do nothing. They're also going to post the slides online.

I don't believe this is a coincidence that my photo was used. My school is relatively small. I'm one of the most well-known students at our school - I'm the VP of our student society and have had tremendous success with co-op/internships. I've met with the co-op department personally several times before and I'm assuming they're out to get me because I quit the co-op program after finding better positions on my own and have publicly advocated against the necessity of our co-op program and the advice they give. My LinkedIn is literred with my school name since I study AND work there as a TA.

Worst part about it is the photo is just a close up of me smiling in front of a background of mountains.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/b5y0kf/my_school_showed_my_linkedin_photo_to_hundreds_of/,legaladvice,1478,55,0.0
waiterlie,2019-03-26 18:58:30+00:00,My workplace is suggesting I have to wear my prosthetic in order to work. Florida.,"I had breast cancer a year ago and had one of them removed. I wear flat most of the time save swimming. My workplace has certain requirements for fashion/appearance. We have to dress nicely, manicure our nails etc. it is not a fashion or creative industry though. I fit the non-revealing uniform just fine. I follow all their policies in their handbook. 

I recently was asked by a supervisor but not my supervisor at my work that it would be a good idea if I wore my prosthetic. They said they felt more comfortable with her telling me because my supervisor is a male. She claimed that a portion of my scar could be seen through the top of my shirt which is true. My scar is higher than normal as I had to have skin removed but it is very faint and just the tip of the scar. To cover it up I would have to wear a very high shirt or sweater. No one else has to wear high shirts, even the women who clearly have cleavage visible when bending over or at other times. 
She went on to mention that I might be better received if I wore it so clients wouldn’t ask questions about why my one side is flat (it is pretty obvious). I asked if my manager knew she was having this talk with me. She said it was his idea. He confirmed it later saying he had been asked by management to discuss my wardrobe with me. But I am wearing the appropriate clothes. They just look different in because I am flat on one side. 

We are suppose to be on brand at all times but I am human being I have scars. People have scars and don’t have them covered. Someone with one in their arm or someone with one on their face. My manager has the one on his face. He isn’t asked to cover it. 

I also don’t think being on brand should involve my breasts at all. They know I had breast cancer. My prosthetic is uncomfortable and it makes me skin sweat. I do not like to wear it for more than a few hours. Stuffing also seems ridiculous. I just feel like I shouldn’t have to worry about my workplace considering my one breast at all. They wouldn’t make a male employee wear a fake ball if he lost his. I get that wouldn’t be seen as much. 

I don’t even think I should have to wear a sweater to cover. It is nearly summer. It is hot here. I have to spend time outside and move around a lot. 

Do I have any protection? Maybe under the ADA?

I tried setting up a first time appointment with a new doctor yesterday. I need a PCP and new BC so wanted this to be a two birds with one stone situation. 

The woman in the office asked what I wanted to be seen for and when I told her birth control, she asked if I was married. I told her no and she then informed me that it's their policy to not prescribe birth control to women that are not married unless it's for a medical condition.

I want to report them to the Texas Medical Board but I'm wondering if they are allowed to do that. I'm not very familiar with Texas as a resident but with it being a red state I wouldn't be surprised if this was allowed.

Hopefully not breaking any rules here. I'd just like to report the office if this is an ethics violation. But don't want to waste anyone's time if it's not by law.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/b5q49m/tx_medical_doctor_will_not_prescribe_birth/,legaladvice,1349,111,0.0

I deposited more money into the account over the years, totaling about $700. I’ve been messing with pennystocks the entire time and while I had some bad losses,I’ve made a very good profit. I’m not going to specify but the account is worth several tens of thousands now. 

Last week I was visiting my grandma and she asked me how the stock account was going (I don’t visit her very often and shes never asked before), and she was shocked when I told her how much I made. She suddenly told me that it was in her name, it was her account, and it was her money. I was super confused but we got into an argument and I ended up leaving. I’ve talked to my parents and they talked to her about it, and apparently they got into an argument too. 

She is insisting that the money is hers, the account is under her name but I put all of the money in it, and did all the trades under the impression that she was letting me use an account under her name, then we’d change the account to my name when I turned 18. I am now 17, turning 18 in 7 months. 

Yesterday I got an email that the bank account was changed and I checked and all the money was gone. I don’t know how she got it because she didn’t know the password, I’m guessing she contacted support or something?

RoyalRot,2019-03-25 01:04:51+00:00,Starbuck's new app is killing Employee's phones," 

What I want to know is what can my coworkers and I do legally in this situation.  
I've been working at Starbucks for 2 years now. They just recently stated that they will be changing their scheduling over to an app called the Intelligent Hub App, for everyone to download. There's no other way to change your schedule, days off, or requesting of vacation if you don't have this app.  
This app's permissions were three screenshots long. I recommend looking through them highly. A majority of them explain how it is an admin app and will factory reset your phone at any time without notification, can exclude your use of your own phones hard ware, view everything you look up on on your browser, uninstall, install, delete, or query information, apps, encrypted data etc. The worst permissions are only listed after downloading and before full installation where they basically explain that they will take all of your information without your permission, though you can still find appalling permissions on the play page.  
The reviews on the play store mostly sound like this  
""I can not uninstall it someone help""  
""I can no longer use my finger print scanner?""  
""DO NOT DOWNLOAD""  
""Since downloading this app none of my SD cards work anymore""  
""My lock screen won't let me in?""  
""My Samsung 9+ became a brick after downloading this app""  
One positive review I saw said ""You are all just mad because your corporate IT found you out""  
Apparently this app is for Work Phones NOT personal phones and Starbucks has already made thousands of employees download it blindly onto their personal phones.  
There was a Q and A paper posted in he back room bulletin full of information saying ""dont worry we just want your Universal Device ID"" Use of a Universal Device ID has been banned from use by Apple, Android, and Windows due to its breech of safety and and privacy and the ease it gives for outside companies to sell personal information.  
My coworkers are already experiencing this infection-like effects on their phones, people can't uninstall it, or access certain places on their browsers anymore, one of my coworkers has also had issues with their camera no longer functioning since they downloaded app. Their phones are dying because of this app and according to the reviews there are thousands more employees experiencing these problems.  
I have already put in my 2 weeks and my last day is April 7th 2019, due to this app amongst other things.

Please help I'm confused and pretty sure this is a huge Class Action Law Suit... What can my coworkers and I do about this?

throwaway_baby100,2019-03-24 20:23:31+00:00,the daughter i gave up for adoption is threatening me with legal action [TX],"When I was 14, I was raped by a close family friend. I got pregnant but gave the baby up for adoption when I was 15. I knew the child was adopted by distant family members who lived a state away but I did not know their names or what they were like. We received a sum of 2500 dollars when they took her from the hospital. I do not remember signing anything.  I do not know what happened to the friend; I asked to be kept out of the process as much as possible. My mother said he was jailed but I don't know if he's still in jail, how long he was in jail, or if he even went to jail. I  have two other children, ages 10 and 7. and am now married. My husband knows about my daughter but has deferred to me on how we should handle the situation.

&amp;#x200B;

A month ago, I received a facebook message from a woman who says she is my daughter. I believe she is because her appearance and that she has the same genetic condition as my rapist. She told me that she wanted to get to know me. I spent hours going through her facebook page, trying to decide what to do. I found myself disgusted by her. There are a lot of similarities between her and my rapist as she is rude, vulgar, whiny, and smokes illicit substances. She is married but has a publicly strained relationship with her husband and refers to him by cruel nicknames. I decided that I would not be comfortable meeting her. I blocked her without responding. After a week, I began to receive letters from her. Four letters in total. I did not read those either but recently received a phone call three days ago. I finally answered. I told her that I was not interested in getting to know her and that she should leave me and my family alone or I would get the police involved.

&amp;#x200B;

She  began to berate me. She told me  that my family was her family. She accused me of not going through proper adoption procedures and that I had maliciously sold her to an abusive couple as punishment for being born and that I had held back important information. Without medical records, she lived life as a very sick child and was deeply in debt from the genetic testing necessary to diagnose her illness.  She told me that she would be making contact with my family whether I liked it or not. She also said she would subpoena me for her father's name if I did not comply and that I could possibly be jailed for selling a baby. When I began to cry, she offered me an alternative; her genetic condition makes getting pregnant more difficult. If I agreed to pay for a round of IVF, she would consider us ""even"" and would only try to make contact with her father. Here are my questions:

&amp;#x200B;

1) Does she have a legal right to make contact with my family if I tell her to stay away? 

2)  Could she force me to disclose information about her birth father?

3) My parents are dead and I do not know how to find out information about the adoption. I did not sign any papers and didn't really speak to lawyers outside the court case. I am worried it is possible my parents merely handed her over in exchange for the money. Could I be arrested for selling her as a teenager?

4) The amount she is asking for is 5,000 dollars. I could pay it easily. Could I form a contract that would legally force her to leave my family alone if I agreed to pay?",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/b511p2/the_daughter_i_gave_up_for_adoption_is/,legaladvice,15107,150,0.0

My building keeps telling me to file maintenance requests and has ignored most of my calls since November. I am being financially impacted now. (TO, Canada)","As the title says, there is a cockroach problem in my building but specifically on my floor. A woman two units down from me had dementia and recently died in her apartment. I knew something was wrong because I began to smell something in the hall, she had been in there four days.

While she was alive the building had tried to address the pest infestation in her apartment, as it began spreading quite rapidly. Anytime they tried to spray, she refused to let them in and I believe it’s because she was mentally unwell. They served her an eviction notice but she died before the 90 days I think? She was always wearing the same thing and was dirty all the time. I called the LHIN (Local Health Integration Network), the city and anytime I had someone lined up to help her she would refuse to let them in, even though she would initially agree. She would speak to my wife but not me, but then forget everything she told my wife or that my wife said to her. We tried to help her but she would forget who we were. It genuinely makes me quite sad.

Anyway. She has died and they have been unable to locate any relatives, she literally had no one. Last night I came home and there were literally cockroaches covering her door and all over the hallway. Adults, babies and every other size. I called building management and they keep telling me to put in a maintenance request, this is has been there solution to every call we have placed. BETTER THAN THAT, they also keep telling me to get her to put one. In case you weren’t reading, she is literally dead. They haven’t even gone in to clean her apartment yet and a few days after the mailman delivered something and left her mail slot ajar, making the whole hallway smell of death.

They refuse to deal with this problem and I am VERY angry. My dog and cat have started eating roaches in our apartment and I have had to ask some friends to care for them temporarily. I pay a lot of money to live here and I am ready to threaten legal action as we have been financially inconvenienced and we have been deprived of the quiet enjoyment of our unit.

hiploy38,2019-03-22 15:45:52+00:00,(Update) Bought a PS4 from Walmart for Christmas and it had books in it,"Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/a98686/bought_a_ps4_from_walmart_box_had_books_in_it_and/

Ever since discovering right before Christmas that the PS4 Spiderman combo my wife purchased for our son had books in it and took it in to get a new one it's been an extremely annoying and stressful time.

I took the advice of everyone and called corporate, talked to corporate in their online chat, everyway possible and it's always the same a answer ""We stand behind the decisions of our salaried managers"".

Corporate literally does not care and shifts it to the ""salaried managers"" decision. So I've been back to the same Walmart 4 times to talk to them and the last time about 2 weeks ago they said they would call the cops. I wasn't yelling, or causing issues I just want the PS4 my wife purchased for our son for Christmas. 

So the last time they called the cops, they came and the manager says right in front of me ""I believe this man has been trying to scam us since Christmas Eve claiming his PS4 had books in the box"". Cop gets my story and says well there isn't enough to do anything against me, manager dislikes this that I've been constantly dealing with and I get permanently banned from the store (just that particular one, he can't ban me from all properties but said he will be calling corporate).

I again try to call corporate and nope, same exact replies that they stand behind their salaried managers decisions.

So the outcome? No PS4, no refund because it was purchased in cash and I cannot do a chargeback. If you are ever purchasing anything expensive from Walmart, open the box immediately after purchase and in front of an employee. Merry Christmas Walmart.

throwawaycec,2019-03-22 09:30:44+00:00,"School Principal made false statements about me, was shown to be wrong, yet is still punishing me (WV)","Some background info - I (28M) am a volunteer assistant basketball coach for a high school girls basketball team for the past 2 seasons.  My dad (64M) is a paid assistant coach on the team for the past 7 seasons.  It is my and my dads alma mater high school and I am very active within the athletic program community including football, boys basketball, girls basketball, and recreational/ all star basketball in a 5th, 6th, and 7th grade league.  The football coaches who coached me are still the same ones as are the boys and girls basketball coaches.  The current girls basketball head coach (48ishM) was my freshman football coach all the way back in 2006.  

&amp;#x200B;

The situation - Back in February the team held a senior night celebration in the school library for our only graduating senior.  At the celebration, there was a cake with the team picture printed on it.  The team picture on the cake included a girl who quit the team mid-January (lets call her ""Q"") but was obviously in the team picture that was taken at the beginning of the season.  She was not at the celebration.  Q's parents told the head coach that she was experiencing some emotional problems and anxiety, etc. and needed to focus on herself.  

&amp;#x200B;

During the celebration some of the girls on the team decided it would be funny to take knives and destroy Q's face on the cake while they recorded on snapchat.  As I walked up to the table to get my dad and I a piece of cake one of the girls (lets call her ""V"") turned her camera away from the cake and towards me.  I smiled at the camera and that was the end of it.  I thought they were just taking pictures of the cake because it did look really nice with their team picture on it.  Well, apparently V decided to write on the snapchat video that I was the one who dug out Q's face.  Then V stupidly sent the snapchat video in a team group chat on snapchat that Q was still a part of because she was previously on the team.  So obviously Q saw the video of her face dug out with the caption that I was the one who had done it.

&amp;#x200B;

Within a week or two of that night, Q's parents raised issues with the school that Q had been bullied all season which was part of the reason why she quit.  There was apparently multiple incidents, that have absolutely nothing to do with me, where Q felt bullied or left out or singled out, etc.  In all reality, I was a big fan of giving Q more playing time on varsity and tried to give her extra attention in practice so as to prepare her to play varsity when she was called upon. The head coach and my dad did not agree and so she did not play very much.  The principal called the lone senior into his office to discuss what had happened and to obtain a copy of the video which she got from V who had the video saved inside her snapchat account.  She had no idea who did the digging out and told him so.  That was mid-late February.  The principal did not say anything else about the issue until this past week/ late last week claiming that he did not want to disrupt the end of the season.  He wanted to have a meeting with myself, my dad, and the head coach Tuesday morning.  We thought we were going to go in, explain what happened, and leave.  But oh no.   

&amp;#x200B;

He asked me what had happened and I told him.  I walked up to the table, V pointed the camera at me and I smiled and I got my pieces of cake and sat back down.  I told him I had no idea she captioned the video that I was the one who dug out Q's face.  I told him I had no idea they had even done that at the time I was at the table but became aware later in the night when the girls pointed it out and were still joking about it but still did not know my name had been put on the video.   I spoke with V on my phone the night before this meeting and recorded the conversation on my dads Iphone (so she could be confronted with her story to me if she tried to change her story the next day).  WV is a single party consent state on recordings for the record.   While speaking with him he told me, my dad, and the head coach that he does not micro manage his coaches and that he respects his coaches decisions but that if it were up to him I would no longer be apart of the team but that it was ultimately the coaches decision.  He told me there was one girl who he called in who claimed I was the one who did the digging.  Total and complete lie.  I responded that he should call in V, the maker of the video he had obtained, and ask her to confirm my story - because V had confirmed to me the night before on the phone that she knew I wasnt involved and would say so,  that it was a joke, it wasnt meant to hurt anyones feelings, etc etc.  After that my dad and I left and the head coach said he would talk to the Principal some more and figure it out.  The head coach also said he didnt want to fracture the team, didnt want them pointing fingers at each other, etc.  

&amp;#x200B;

Over the next 48 hours (Tuesday and Wednesday) we contacted a couple of the girls who also confirmed that I did not do anything to the cake but that they could not remember/ did not know who did anything to the cake.  We figured they did not want to be seen as a snitch to the other girls, which I get.  We just wanted them to confirm that I had nothing to do with any cake shenanigans with the belief the principal would figure out the cake culprit eventually.  Theres no way 14 girls who were all taking pictures and videos dont know who was doing it.  

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to Thursday.  The principal finally called V into his office and asked her about it and she confirmed that I did not touch the cake, she put my name on it as a joke, but that she did not know who messed with Q's face on the cake.  She confirmed I was not involved in any way, shape, or form.  The principal called me on the phone and said despite this information, I still wouldnt be coming back to the program.  I asked him ""why was I being punished if hes confirmed I didnt do anything wrong"" and he said  ""you arent being punished.""  Which prompted me to ask ""how am I not being punished if you are asking me not to come back? Why would I not be allowed to help coach the girls if its been confirmed I didnt do anything wrong?""  He said he wasnt discussing the issue further and that the decision had been made.  

&amp;#x200B;

This kind of baffled me and my dad because the head coach is a very very good friend and our coaching group is extremely close.  We ride to every game together, have a coaches group text, and are very in sync with each other and what we want the team to do.  I have a very good relationship with the head coaches middle school aged children who I occasionally shoot around with, play Fortnite with, or drive to their own practices so that their dad can stay with the High School practice with My dad.  Its a very ""big brother"" type relationship.  My dad contacted the head coach and asked him who made this decision because we knew the head coach would not have made the decision to remove me.  The head coach said that the principal made the decision, even though the principal told us to our face that the decision would be the head coaches because ""he doesnt micro manage his coaches.""

Thursday night I attend an AAU basketball team practice where a majority of the girls are on the high school team as well.  At the practice we spoke with the girls and they all confirmed that not only did I have nothing to do with any cake destroying but that it was V and another girl who did the destroying and that another teammate was going around telling people to say that they did not know or did not remember who did anything to the cake.  They did not care about snitching because they do not want to get in trouble for something they had no part of.  3 of them offered to go to the principal tomorrow and tell him who did it and once again confirm to him that I had nothing to do with it.  Additionally, during the day our 3rd assistant coach (we will call him T) texted the head coach again confirming that I had nothing to do with the cake and that he remembered the girls talking about it and taking pictures but that he wasnt 100% sure who actually did it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have 3 issues with this whole situation: (1) by doing this to me they are effectively forcing my dad to quit as well because he is not going to stay and be around people who are throwing me under the bus. (2) By the principal telling me I would not be returning to the team, despite the fact he knows the truth, makes it still seem like Ive done something wrong or inappropriate.  (3) Is the principal not required to investigate bullying issues immediately?  The incident in question happened over a month ago and the principal is just now getting around to interviewing people and investigating the incident.  Meanwhile, Q has had to go to school with these girls the whole time.  For something that is allegedly ""no tolerance"" it sure seems like they tolerated it for almost 6 weeks until the principal felt like dealing with it.  And even now it seems like they are going to tolerate it if they can get away with just dismissing me and sweeping everything else under the rug.  

&amp;#x200B;

An AAU team parent told my dad and I Thursday night that he was in Huntington Tuesday morning and that word had already gotten down there that our program was dismissing a coach.  How it got down there I have no clue but apparently it did.   

&amp;#x200B;

Is this not defamation or slander?  I am not a public figure, I am a volunteer assistant coach.   Dismissing someone from a team, even after you admit theyve done nothing wrong, seems to imply that something wrong was in fact done, otherwise there would be no reason for the dismissal.  People dont get fired because they did nothing wrong.  When this inevitably gets out or during summer session when parents ask ""why isnt throwaway helping coach the girls?"" they are going to be told he was dismissed during the off season.  Thats going to imply I did something wrong, when it has been confirmed from almost 10+ sources that I did not do anything wrong.   That is going to affect my chances to potentially coach anywhere else giving me potential damages, were I to become a paid assistant coach like my dad.   While there are no ""actual damages"" because I am a volunteer there are definitely general damages considering my reputation and name is being drug through the mud and my dad and I have been suffering some pretty serious emotional distress.  My dad and I havent slept all week and it has begun to affect him at work and my anxiety (which I have a prescription for) has been off the charts.   Hence me writing this at 4:40 am.  This is a very small community and if word traveled all the way to Huntington, on the day of the meeting, that coaches were being dismissed I am sure it will quickly make its way around the community giving people a false impression that I have done something wrong or inappropriate warranting my dismissal.  This could affect my future coaching prospects with my 5/6/7 league as well if parents are uncomfortable with their kids being coached by someone who was dismissed, without knowing that the dismissal was unwarranted.    

&amp;#x200B;

My fear in all of this is that I am being thrown under the bus so that the school/principal does not have to initiate a bullying investigation most likely resulting in player punishments, media attention, head coach potentially being fired, etc or get the county school board involved because once they get involved and discover some of the other issues within the team all hell is going to break loose - girls drinking, alleged drug use, head coach accusing a girl of being drunk the night before a game (on a school night) as an excuse for why she was playing bad(its on film), the head coach telling the girls he could be at home drinking beer and smoking cigs rather than at practice, showing up to practices over Christmas break obviously hungover, making racist (although totally joking) jokes and quips about a players ethnicity and her mother's speech patterns (because she barely speaks English), other instances of team members bullying Q, parents having events for select members of the team but not inviting others while using team gear for these events.  It got so bad at the beginning of the season, because older players were bullying a freshman player out of her locker spot, that team captains had to write a letter to all team members and taped it in everyones locker saying that the team did not need the drama, they are all 1 team, etc.  There was no punishment for that incident except a tough tongue lashing to the team by the head coach.  I obviously dont want girls to be suspended or expelled or anything else, this truly was just silly high school girls joking around, but they are the ones who screwed up and bullied a girl and negligently posted it in the team snapchat group that she was a part of.  I dont want any money or drama I just want to get my volunteer coaching position back and make it so my dad does not have to quit.   I understand I am only a volunteer and probably can be fired for whatever reason the principal sees fit but he specifically told us his coaches make the decision and then the head coach tells us that the principal is the one who made the decision.  And furthermore, and most importantly, its been confirmed Ive done nothing wrong!  Even Q's parents, who initiated this entire ordeal, have confirmed to my dad that they believe I had nothing to do with it because we are friends with them outside of basketball and are not ok with me being dismissed and that is not the resolution they are looking for.  They want girls on the team to be punished for their conduct.  

&amp;#x200B;

Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you very much.

throwmeinalake123,2019-03-21 14:51:58+00:00,"[WA] My father and step mother died, leaving me (19m) and my step sister (8f). My step sisters father, who has previously never cared about her, is getting full custody and has told me he won't allow me to visit. Is there anything I can do?","Hi, so my life is falling apart.

As the title says, a few weeks ago my father and my step mother were killed in a car accident. They have been married for 7 years, and my step mother had a daughter from a previous marriage who is 8 years old. I love her unconditionally as if she were my own sister and I would fight tooth and nail to keep her safe.

She has no immediate family other than her father in the area, so he is going to receive full custody of her. I don't know if subjective opinions are allowed in posts like this, but this guy is a fucking asshole. The reason my step mother left him is because he was abusive (which was never reported to the police, but I know several people who have witnessed it first hand, so it absolutely 100% happened), and the reason he was abusive was because my step sister was born and he didn't want a child. As a result, he has never given a shit about her, never asked to see her, and has never wanted anything to do with her until now.

I was at home with my step sister a few days ago and he knocked on the door. I opened it and we had a really ugly conversation about what was going to happen to my step sister now that her mother and my father were dead. I told him that if he did end up having custody I would want to be seeing her as often as possible as I consider her my family. He told me, verbatim ""that's not gonna happen, son. I don't want my daughter spending time with half caste blood."" (he's referring to the fact that my father is mixed race, and that I am too as a result. I slammed the door. I was absolutely livid, which brings me to this post.

So basically, I have a few questions:  
First, Can anything be done to stop him having custody? There are no police reports about his abuse, and his criminal record is clean by all the research I have completed.

Third, at the very least, could I contend in a court that I have visiting rights to her? I'm not actually related to her, so I'm not sure what the standing is there.

Third, if it's not possible to force allowed visits, is there anyway I can straight up adopt my step sister? I have an office job that pays well, so financial security wouldn't be a problem, I have an apartment of my own, and I would be 100% willing to be her full time guardian. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you so so so much to anyone who responds to this. I'm at my wits end and I will do literally anything to keep my step sister close to me, and I don't care about the cost.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/b3rfty/wa_my_father_and_step_mother_died_leaving_me_19m/,legaladvice,11594,165,0.0

The other witnesses all lied and the man was charged with a felony assault.,"After a few days, I convinced my boyfriend to make a statement. He was initially uncomfortable because the night of the incident, the true aggressor’s significant other was pressuring people to make false statements. His friend called the non-emergency line to explain that they wanted to make a statement. Initially, the officer thought they were just trying to add an additional statement to support what was already known. When he realized they were providing new evidence, he stopped the phone call and arrived at their house within ten minutes. He took their statement, told them it could significantly alter this man’s case, and said they should expect a follow up call in a few months and also be prepared to be subpoenaed if it comes to that. He chided them pretty hard for waiting so long to make a statement.

Thank you to the user who suggested I look in the Facebook marketplace. I found it in there and got the name of the man who took it. 

I took that information to the police and the man had other complaints of petty theft against  him. 

Even better, one of the people who helped me move realized my neighbor has a video doorbell and I was able to get proof to the cops that the man stole my couch with me standing right there with a moving truck and boxes. 

A friendly officer went to his house and got my couch back, as well as a few other stolen outdoor furniture pieces (one was a bench from a local restaurant, I don’t know the other situations.)

cy_ko8,2019-03-20 18:48:10+00:00,[Update II Additional Advice Needed] An employee has obtained a personal video of me and is showing it to others.,"This is unfortunately not the update that I wanted to post. I was informed yesterday that HR’s decision, based on the counsel of our legal department, is to continue employing the individual who stole a private video of me from her boyfriend’s phone and offered to/showed it to multiple people. She, with no hyperbole, did her very best to ruin my life. This decision was based on the fact that they couldn’t find anyone who would admit to seeing the video, although it was determined that she did offer to show it to people. The people who I am close to declined to watch it and her friends would not admit that she showed it to them.

HR’s decision initially was to bring her back today and have the two of us sit with them to “talk it out.” My manager, director, and VP are strongly against bringing her back at all, and were able to extend her date of return until next Tuesday based on a previous vacation request she’d made. They are going to flat out refuse to allow her back into our department where I would still be her boss, and will not ask me to sit with her. I am so, so grateful to have their support and protection. My manager told them flat out that he wouldn’t insult me by putting me in a position where I’d have to speak to her face to face. He told them that pressuring me into sitting down with her was wrong on every level. Today he and my VP went to speak with them directly with their pushback, and my director is going in tomorrow.

I don’t know how they aren’t seeing this as sexual harassment. I really don’t. I also don’t know how they expect me to be able to do my job managing her after all of this. They’re giving her a “final written warning,” skipping the first and second warnings. If she slips up, is hostile to me, continues to harass me, she will be gone automatically. My guess is that this is as much as they were able to do from a legal standpoint, but it’s honestly just baffling to me that there isn’t more that could be done.

Again, I’m located in New York City. Is there anyone who is able to offer advice or a different perspective? I’m happy to provide any additional clarity.

JoMarch15,2019-03-20 15:24:09+00:00,(IL) I’m a coach. One of my players was sexually assaulted during co-ed practice in the pool. Admin giving boy a “warning” on a “zero tolerance policy.”,"A player (female high schooler) was talking to her boyfriend after co-ed practice. She stated that a boy had groped her. A teacher overheard and came to me (head coach). I had a meeting with her and she reported that her breasts were groped by a male player. This happened twice during the practice. The first time she thought it was a “weird accident” but she knew the second time it was intentional. She punched him and swam away. 

This is not her first time being groped by this young man. He was her dance partner in a play a few months ago and touched her then too. At this time she did not report it. 

I reported the assault to my administration. They (3 men) had an all day meeting about the situation. They did not include any of the women’s coaching staff, only the coach for the boys team was present. They did not take a statement from me as head coach either. The parents of the girl state that they “trust the school”. 

The administrations decision was to end co-ed practicing, we will still be in the same pool at the same time however. They have decided that because she did not come forward during the play, that the boy can not be held accountable for that time. The decided to give him a “warning” despite our program having an identified “zero tolerance” policy on sexual assault in sports. 

After the meeting, the boy sent out a group message to the members of the boys team stating that he was “getting kicked off the team for what happened with ______”. Now the students are all privy to the info and picking sides. Some are saying they don’t believe her, this is obviously victim shaming. There are even teachers who are saying that he’s not the kind of boy who would do this. 

This is my last season coaching at this school. I am willing to go all out to make the point that sexual assault has no place in high school sports. I have thought about quitting in protest.

If her parents aren’t standing up for her what can I do?  How do I face my administration and make them accountable for their set expectations of zero tolerance? This is not acceptable behavior from the school but what can I do? ",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/b3dbfr/il_im_a_coach_one_of_my_players_was_sexually/,legaladvice,4494,106,0.0
dontniceguyatme,2019-03-20 07:50:32+00:00,(Florida) someone keeps listing my condo as an air bnb. It's illegal in my zone.,"I live in south beach,  airbnb is illegal here. A ton of people still do it, but most don't cause major issues. Someone (I am 95% sure i know who)  keeps listing my unit number (with photos of another apartment) on short term rental sites. One day a guy waltzed into my place with luggage, and started yelling at me to get out. Oddly, he threatened to call the police on ME if I didn't leave. I grabbed a weapon and he reluctantly left.  The police determined that he rented from someone that put my unit number up, but the photos/ contact info arent mine. I guess the scam is usually supposed to get the money. The scammer uses the money to get a real apartment,  then last minute they reroute the guest to their unit. I guess this one never cancels.

I immediately contacted the property manager,  security, and made a call to non emergency. The next day I got 2 cameras. Since then, 8 groups of crying/irate tourists have come to my door with luggage in the middle of the night.  I immediately call the property manager and non emergency (often the guests call 911 to attempt to force me out of my own house. Proof I own is now pinned next to my door inside) 

I genuinely feel bad for them,  some have traveled for days only to be forced to find a room at 10x the price they paid since its the popular season.  I honestly feel for them,  but there's not much I can do for them other than to talk to the police confirming they were scammed and show proof air bnb is not legal here. 

You cannot enter my building unless someone buzzes you in. I asked the people what number they dialed,  and it was the apartment of a known airbnb. I know the guy inside,  he's not a decent person.  When I asked him about it, he got nasty and pretended to not speak english.  He has since been evicted (for airbnbing) Yet the random arrivals still happen. The guests are now using a maintenance code to enter, so they don't need to be buzzed up.

The police and property manager do thankfully believe me on this. But is there anything I can do to get him to stop? I'm waiting for the day someone breaks in, or gets physically violent.  Some of these people paid thousands and now have to pay 600 to 1k a night for a hotel after dealing with police,  phone calls, and stress.

I can't go on these sites and find my place,  since the photos used aren't of my place,  and the unit isn't available to you until after you pay. he keeps making different profiles or using friends to make the ads, since they're rarely the same person/ company twice. 

I am not the only condo in the building facing these issues. I have put a sign on my door saying this is not an air bnb, it's a private residence and to not disturb. Yet (obviously) people still bang on my door while yelling.  Is there anything we can all do together?  The property manager says since he doesn't live there anymore,  there's nothing she can do. The police say without definite proof its him,  they can't help much.

wordsonlips,2019-03-20 07:21:00+00:00,(CA) Got hit by a driver who ran away and I just received a letter from a public defender asking me to remedy by civil compromise,"TL:DR - I was the victim in a hit and run. The guy got a misdemeanor hit and run and now a public defender wants me to remedy by civil compromise. If I do this, I am being told that the criminal case will probably be dropped. I don't want to sue him, I want him to be punished for his crimes and crappy behavior, but I don't really understand what I'm being asked to do. What should I do and what happens if I don't sign?   


In late August of 2018, I (31f) was stopped due to traffic on the 210 freeway in Pasadena around 2 pm on a weekday when I struck by a white pickup truck being driven by an older white male. The collision caused me to run into a white Mercedes being driven by an 30-something year old Asian man (he also had his infant son). During the collision, I hit my head really hard to the point where I went to the ER to get checked out for concussion. While I did not have a concussion, I did have a big bump and bruising, none of which I got pictures of. Furthermore, my 2008 Toyota Yaris was so damaged that the doors couldn't open properly and the car was totaled. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, after the collision, both the pickup truck and the Mercedes moved over to the emergency lane (my car had been hit into the emergency lane already). The drivers side of my car of smashed closed, so I crawled over to the passenger side and had to push to get it open. I was disoriented but trying to keep my calm, so by the time I got out, the guy who hit me had gotten out of his truck and was approaching me. The first thing he said to me was ""those tin cars are so weak. You just tap them and they crumple"" as though he was annoyed with me. He also was clearly slurring his words and was very large and intimidating. I thought the best thing to do was to play nice and then call the police to get involved. So I told him that I hit my head and wasn't feeling well so I was going to call 911 and sit in my car because I might pass out. He clearly stumbled to the Mercedes, where the Asian man was getting out of his car. He was pulling out his son, who was crying. The white man  began talking, and the Asian man asked if he had been drinking (because the man also clearly smelled like alcohol) before putting his son back in the car. As the man put his baby back in the car, the white dude turned around and began stumbling back to his car. I remember thinking that the man who hit us was going to drive away, so I picked up a pen and wrote down the license plate and every detail possible on my arm. When he drove away, he flipped me off.   


So I connect with the Asian man who is okay, the cops get there and take our statements, the baby gets checked out and he's ok, and the cop directs me to drive my car off the freeway. Once it gets to the downslope of the off ramp, it becomes clear that my car can't turn and isn't functioning/dripping a lot of fluid, so we get a pickup truck to get it. My mom picks me up and takes me to the hospital because I have a big bump on my head. By the time we get out of the hospital, several hours later, the cops have found the man who hit and run. I go to the police station and correctly ID him.  


A few weeks later, I go to pick up the police report to find out if the man has insurance because my insurance company is having a hard time finding it out. In the police report, I find out that the man said that I hit the Mercedes and that he only stopped to make sure we were okay. However, because I had a witness and it was obvious that my car had been hit behind, he was charged with a misdemeanor hit and run. Furthermore, because it took several hours to find him, he did not have a high enough BAC to get charged with a DUI. He also has not turned in the truck and to my knowledge, his insurance company and the policy have never seen it. Finally, he did not tell the police he had insurance so it took my insurance company awhile to discover and contact his insurance company.  


My insurance company ended up giving my parents about $5k for the Toyota Yaris (my parents bought it for me for graduation and it was in their name), which they gave me to apply to a new car. His insurance company, who waited to work with me for almost two months because they could not get a statement from him (he has continued to deny he was involved), worked with me and paid for my medical bills for the ER visit, 12 hours of work time at $40/ hr (even though I make $75  as a private educator, they didn't like that I didn't have an employer with a time sheet to show missed work), and $500 for my struggle (which I didn't ask for but thought was cool).    


Then about a week ago, my parents and I got a letter from a public defender asking us to remedy by civil compromise. They gave me and my parents a paper to sign. It says:  


Civil Compromise:  


""I, wordsonlips, declare as follows: That I am the Victim in the above-entitled case. I will remedy by civil compromise. I do not wish to continue prosecution against the defendant. I have received restitution on behalf of the defendant, which fully compensates any losses sustained as a result of any actions of the defendant. Because full satisfaction has been made, I wish to have this case dismissed. I make this statement of my own free will and without any coercion, and I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.""  


My parents have the same form, just with their names on it. Included was a letter that says that if I sign this document, the state ""may"" drop his criminal case as well.   


I am not after any more money, and I looked up the man and I don't think he has anything of value anyway. However, this guy hit me and another man and a baby, knew that I was in distress and that a baby could be hurt, was definitely drunk whether the state acknowledges it or not, tried to blame me, and has done nothing to make the process easy on me or his own insurance company. I don't want to sign this, because I want him to face consequences for his actions and I want him to get help for his drinking. I want to make sure that I am contributing somewhat to preventing him from doing this again. And there is part of me that wants to tell my own story and call out this asshole to a judge.

&amp;#x200B;

That being said: 

What exactly does this civil compromise mean and why am I being asked to sign this?

If I do sign, am I basically giving the state a reason not to pursue criminal charges?

If I don't sign, am I suing him and should I get a lawyer? Do I need to ask for money from him? Should I?  
If I don't sign, what am I getting myself into? Could I have years of court dates for a misdemeanor?    


My dad and I are going to call the public defender on Thursday, but any advice or knowledge will be greatly appreciated.

My bfs hobby is to take re-claimed wood custom cut it and make table tops or shelves out of them, selling some tables for $400 or more. I had 3 of these 7ft long oak wood sitting on the side of my house for a month, out to dry in the sun, on planks. This lady that lives in the area assumed they were for the trash and publicized the wood online as ""next to a dumpster and going to a landfill"" (my recycling bin was next to this wood, on the back end of my house.) I came home to my wood missing and I found her post online, giving it away for free with my exact home address for all to see. Someone unknowingly thinking it was hers to give away snagged them. I contacted the guy, and got it back. I then wrote her a message showing her a screenshot of the NY State Government Property Lines website of my properties boarder which she clearly crossed over to take the photo of the wood on my property. I told her to never do that again and mind her own business. Her response was ""I am quite too busy to read all this, either way it was a mistake. Good luck out there in this shitty world, it sure is a bear."" After that passive aggressive bullshit I went to the police. I filed for tresspassing.

I recently turned 18 and until now, my mother still had all my documents like my birth certificate, my bank account stuff, and of course my vaccination certificate. I never had any problem with that because I knew she kept it safe and didn't misuse it to hurt me or something. At least until now. 

A bit of backstory; I was vaccinated as a baby, but sometime in between then and now, my mother got it into her head that vaccines are harmful. My mom's pretty naive, the kind of person that reads something on FB and assumes it must be true and doesn't actually look up sources or even google anything, ever. Because of that, she thinks vaccines cause mental illness, don't help, are all just a big gimmick by the pharma industry, you get what I mean. Obviously I learned about vaccines in biology and I informed myself about them so I know that's all bs.

When I was 14 and knew it was about time my vaccinations get refreshed, I asked my mom to go to the doctor with me to get them, but my mom refused to allow me. ""You can do what you want when you're 18,"" she said. Thing is, I turned 18 recently, and the first thing I looked into was finally getting my vaccinations. I got infected with whooping cough last year,  it was the worst 7 weeks of my life and I had injuries along my ribs because of it that took an entire month to heal.

It could have been prevented if I had just been vaccinated and I want to take those precautions concerning my health now. So I made an appointment with my doctor for the 25th this month. I assumed it wouldn't be a problem, because I'm 18 now and there's nothing my mom can do to stop me. Or so I thought.

She is vehemently refusing to hand over my vaccination certificate which my doctor said I should bring with me. We've had a lot of fights about it, and no matter what I say or how many facts about vaccines I tell her, she isn't listening to anything because I ""have no life experience"" and she ""knows a doctor from her anti-vaxx FB group who says vaccines cause autism"". 

She vague posted about me in her anti-vaxx FB group, talking about her ""poor child with no life experience who's blinded by the pharma industry"". She also talked about me with people in our family that have the same views as her. Since then, random FB people I don't know and members of my own family have been constantly sending me messages and even calling me, trying to talk me out of getting vaccinated and telling me I'm stupid. I feel like I can't go to family gatherings anymore because I will be harassed and put on the spot and my mother would encourage it.

I just want to get vaccinated in peace! But she won't give me my vaccination certificate and the 25th is getting closer. So I wanted to ask; Is what she is doing illegal? And in the likely case she won't give me my documents in the next few days, can I still get my vaccinations without it? I don't actually intend to press any charges against my mother, I would have nowhere to go and no money without her. But maybe I can pressure her into giving me the documents if iI tell her she's committing a crime.

sushi_mama,2019-03-17 02:17:14+00:00,Pregnant and in a same sex relationship. How do I ensure my wife doesn’t have to fight my parents for custody if I die during labor? [PA],"[PA] My wife and I (same sex couple) have been together for 11 years and are gearing up for the birth of our first child. I’m the one carrying and am two months away from my due date (ah!) We have been steadily prepping for the last few months and are now at the stage of working through the impending legal issues - namely step parent adoption so my wife has the same guardianship rights and privileges that I will have as the bio parent. But from my understanding we can’t start the adoption process until after the baby is born. Not sure it matters but we conceived using a sperm bank so the donor has already signed away legal rights. 

My pregnancy is healthy and normal, so we don’t anticipate any complications during birth. But nonetheless, I want to make absolutely certain that custody of the baby go to my wife in the event of my death during delivery. It is vital that this happens because I fear my parents will fight my wife for custody. They are extremely religious (fundamentalist Christians) who disowned me at 18 when I began dating my wife. They are AGGRESSIVE about imposing their spiritual views on everyone. It was a constant environment of harsh judgement, intense shame, fighting for autonomy and control, gaslighting, and physical &amp; emotional abuse. I cut off contact completely almost four years ago and my life has been a whole lot happier since. 

But when I got pregnant the family drama started up again. My parents have been desperately trying to force their way back into our lives. I’ve blocked their calls but still receive dozens of emails with bible verses about obeying your parents, repenting your sins, and raising god-fearing children. Even an article about the grandparents rights movement. They use my siblings to deliver unwanted messages and gifts - one of which included a book called “Gay Girl, Good God” about a lesbian who claims to have successfully prayed the gay away. 

I’m sickened by their behavior and have absolutely no intention of resuming contact with them, much less allowing them to be a part of my child’s life. That’s why it is essential for me to ensure my wife has legal rights over our baby from the moment it’s born. But I honestly have no idea how to go about it. Can my wife adopt the baby in utero? If I draft a will giving custody to my wife would that fully protect them? I know this is an insane precaution given that both the baby and I are healthy and normal risk. But I don’t want to leave anything to chance. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Fosteringathrowaway,2019-03-16 21:58:25+00:00,Biomother of my foster son wants to sue me for vaccinating (MD),"Hey all. This might come out jumbled since I just got an email about this and I'm very frazzled. I'm sorry if some of this doesn't make sense.

My wife and I (also a woman) are fostering a baby boy who is almost two. He was taken from his birth mother because of some child neglect and his mother went to jail. We have been fostering him for nearly six months and are planning on adopting him, unless his mother can make a bid for custody back. She currently doesn't have a steady job and her housing situation is iffy as best so I do not think that is likely. How biological father is unknown.

My son attends daycare and last month, caught pertussis (whooping cough). He was hospitalized for two days but he pulled through. We realized he had missed several vaccines, so after he recovered, we got him caught up.

Last week at visitation, the caseworker mentioned this to biomom who freaked out about poisoning her baby and giving her autism. He (caseworker) explained that this wasn't the case, and that we're trying to protect him from illness, especially at his daycare. She said we violated her religious rights. (Religion has never come up before.)

We kind of brushed it off because she is always exaggerating things to get her son back (which is expected). She's also complained that she didn't want her son raised by two women but there weren't other foster parents available at the time (according to the social worker). But today she emailed us that she has a lawyer and she will take us to court for damages to her son. He hasn't been damaged by the vaccines at all, beyond a basic booboo.

Can she really take us to court? Does she have a case? My wife said I'm overreacting and that the judge will throw it out, but I'm not so sure.

(Hit and Run)","I first posted this in EntitledBitch because I wanted to ventilate and people told me to seek for legal advices here  before everything.

Legal Questions : If they sue me, is there a risk I lose?
What can I do to get the name of the person who hit me through his insurances?
If I get his name can I sue him accuse him of this :https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/section-252-20030101.html or something similar?
If their insurances sue me, can I countersue them?

Those are all my questions so uh I guess you want to hear my story now :

 Tldr : Title

This is my first post ever after being a long time lurker in Reddit and I hope this story belongs here.

I'm French Canadian (sorry for my English mistakes) so our insurance is different here. When you get hit by a car, there's no culprit if it was an accident and no one will sue anyone because the province's service will use their funds the victim to go back in track. I got my indemnities from https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/en/saaq/ so the accident was no one fault. It was just an accident.

That said. 3 years ago, when I was 18, I went to work like every morning at 8 o'clock. I walked on the street with priority for pedestrians. Then Bam. I woke up the next day. In the Hospital. My brother crying over me. I blacked out after a car hit me. I stayed there for a week.

My right thigh exploded, my left (I am a leftie) humerus got broken from the inside, I broke 3 teeth and my jaw is now fucked up so I need a night guard when I sleep so I don't break my teeth.

TMI arm then thigh : https://imgur.com/o4t2ENC / https://imgur.com/KdStDkL

I've recovered well from the accident (https://imgur.com/ckZ1JV4), didn't get any ptsd (From all I know, I didn't see therapist) and after 6 months, I was totally independent. I didn't hold any
 grudges to that person who hit me because it was worthless. I didn't know him. No one in my family saw him after the accident. It was basically a hit and run.

Fast forward today, I received a letter from someone's insurances about the fact I owe 18k because I would have damaged someone's car. I would have done those damages the date of my accident 3 years ago. They said they already have sent me a mail 2 years ago (that I have never received) and that if I do not pay that debt, they will take legal actions against me.

So not only, this son of a bitch who I have never heard the name of got away with a hit and run, but they have the nerves to reclaim money from me after stealing 6 months of my life by saying I hurt their car with my 150lbs body against his car. My medical report says that for the injuries I got, he was surely going at 50km/h in zone of 30 because there's a school nearby.

What should I do?

ashgcoop,2019-03-16 05:05:05+00:00,"Sister got 30 day “eviction” notice from her nursing home stating that the reasons for eviction are “bladder/bowel incontinence”. [GA, USA]","Sorry for the long post with maybe a little too much TMI. TL/DR at bottom. Also on mobile, sorry for formatting. 

So, as the title states, my sister got I guess what you could call an eviction notice from the owner of her nursing home today at 5 pm with the reason being that she has “bladder/bowel incontinence”. To explain things a little more, my sister has spina bifida. I’ll try to explain without sounding like I’m giving TMI. Ever since she was born, she has NOT been able to control the muscles needed to control these things. She has worn adult diapers for as long as I have been alive. 

In August of 2018, she got moved into a nursing home facility in Georgia. They were aware of all of her medical needs upon arrival. I talk to my sister on an almost daily basis so she always lets me know what is going on in this nursing home. She is supposed to be provided transportation to and from doctors appointments, and there is a nurse in charge of scheduling patients appointments and getting the refills for their medication. At one point, a nurse canceled one of her appointments where she would be getting her prescription refilled, and when my sister questioned about her appointment, they told her that she canceled it herself (which, she did not do. She is very young so she still fully has her wits about herself, she just needs help taking care of herself with her disabilities—she also had an under-the-knee amputation to one of her legs 3 years ago). Due to her missing her mysteriously canceled appointment, she went without numerous medications for around a week. Around this time, the home also restricted her to using no more than 3 pairs of disposable underwear a day. Due to this, she contracted a terrible UTI and needed immediate medical care. After this took place, she started ordering her own disposable diapers in bulk. The residents are allowed to order things for themselves. 

This is where it starts to get questionable. They would either make her open the amazon box to see what was inside or they would do it themselves. Then, they started stocking her underwear with their stock of underwear for the patients and only giving her one if she came to ask for it—they would not let her keep it in her room. After a while, and a few complaints later, they finally started letting her keep the underwear SHE purchased in her how room. Around this time, they complained that she had “become incompetent” after moving in, and that she arrived to the facility in “normal underwear” — both of which are not true. She does not own “normal underwear” nor have I EVER seen her wear a pair. 

She takes care of herself as much as she can, and she makes sure she keeps herself clean. She does not leave dirty diapers lying around the place or soiled clothes. She always disposes of the diapers in a tied up bag in the trash bin that the nurses told her to use. She does not sit on or mess up any of the home’s furniture—she uses her own wheelchair not provided by the home. There are others in the nursing home that must wear the disposable underwear, too, as they cannot control when they have to go. 

There are numerous things that go on at this place that seem fishy, and there have been employees/nurses that have even spoken rudely to my sister (while our mother was on the phone with her and could hear everything the nurse was saying).

My sister pays her “rent” to live there every single month on time. She has been battling with depression for some time so she occasionally has an off-day where she’s feeling pretty down. On those days, she may cry a little and then get on with her everyday life. The nurses have told her to stop crying and even berated her to try to figure out what she’s crying about. Overall, this place is sketchy and rude, but she really has no other options right now. 

The official owner was at the facility ALL DAY today, and waited until 5 PM to hand my sister a 30 day eviction notice. The reason for the eviction is “bladder/bowel incompetence”. From what I have found, nursing homes have very few reasons they can actually evict a patient: non-payment, excessive &amp; expensive care, etc. She foots the bill for her own underwear (which is provided to other patients WHENEVER they need one—they only seemed to have a problem with her specifically). She cleans up after herself, which, not trying to sound rude, is more than most of the other patients can do (although I do realize that some of them are not physically able to do this). 

She pays her rent on time each and every month. Waiting until the very end of the work week (5pm on a Friday for crying out loud) means that my sister could not begin contacting the Medicaid/Medicare offices and other social worker offices since they were now all closed, meaning she will have to wait until Monday to try to find out where to go from here. She has called and left messages for people, but will likely not head more until the start of next week. 

Is this legal? Can they evict her because she can not help when she goes to the restroom because she 1) cannot feel that she has to go, and 2) cannot control the muscles needed to hold it in/know when to go. They knew that she was like this when she became a patient. She does not even use their underwear. She is in Georgia. Can anyone point me in the right direction if anything can be done so I can forward it on to her? 

Sorry for the long post, just trying to include as many details as possible. 

TL/DR: sister got 30 day eviction notice from nursing home. Reason for eviction: “bladder/bowel incontinence”—that the home was aware of. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/b1ou37/sister_got_30_day_eviction_notice_from_her/,legaladvice,1106,103,0.0

Many People have came across this known scammer in the community, I have gotten several PM's regarding the scammer and his attempts to scam [r/forhire](https://www.reddit.com/r/forhire) out of labor and money.

After, being told ""payment will come soon"" a week after the agreed upon date, I decided to call him out on pushing the dates. I called him asking when I could expect to be paid, he immediately became hostile, told me that he's having a rough day, along with some very vulgar threats if i contacted him again and I was annoying him for asking about my pay! *Was it wrong for me to want to get paid for my work.* He then texted me that he apologizes for lashing out on me, he's a friendly guy going through a rough time and payment will come tomorrow in the AM.

I was already spectacle about getting paid due to hearing about his many scams and decided to take things into my own hands. I contact my friend, a Corporate Lawyer who doesn't live far from Scammer, he was happy to help me out for free + Postage. He drafted a intent to sue for scammer, outlining the crimes he's committing. He dropped it off at the local post office of Scammer, and that morning I receive a very angry call.

Scammer decided that he didn't have to payment since his client cancelled on him. He told me: since he's not getting paid, not to expect pay and called me very vulgar names. I only replied, ""I am not playing games, I will not be scammed, I will be taking legal action to ensure this doesn't happen to anyone else and I know you're a known scammer and I will be putting an end to it."" and hung up.

I continued to receive 3 phone calls I didn't bother to answer, until the 4th call. The 4th, he came clean. He said he couldn't afford to pay me the full amount. Clearly I still wanted the full amount and wouldn't settle, I'd rather take him to court. I decided he could pay what he could for an extension, on March 12th he paid $500 ($250-Debit, $250-Credit). He claimed he would pay the rest on Thursday morning (march 14th). He didn't follow through on his promise, so i decide to message him I would be taking further action. Immediately after he called me and told me he couldn't pay because *""he's been busy"".* I was tired of dealing with him, I decided to tell him I wanted my agreed pay, he has till the morning to pay it.

He told me to never contact him again after he pays. That's fair right. I guess I struck a nerve with the scammer because ended up paying the full amount, *with $500 of it being on his personal credit card*. My processor showed his debit card got declined twice.

# In the end I won! I beat the scammer!

**Bonus:** I did contact his ""client's"" regarding his practices, it turns out those weren't even his clients. He was pitching to them, while showing examples (my designs) but they didn't trust him, due to his CTR promise of 1 lead per $25. They were interested in getting marketing and web design done, I sent them over a proposal yesterday and have a call scheduled today with them!

Pettheftthrow,2019-03-14 21:23:06+00:00,(Update) The exceptionally stupid ending to the cat scam saga-cat now has a no contact order,"You all thought it over.  So did I.  But no!  Turns out this story really could get weirder

Recap- years ago I took in an injured stray cat.  The cat was did not have a collar or chip.  A good faith attempt was made to locate possible owners. After owning the cat for several years I began receiving messages on social media from someone claiming to be the original owner.  They demanded I return the cat and I refused and blocked them.  Eventually they escalated to sending letters to my home on letterhead from a nonexistent lawyer's office.  The letters demanded I pay hundreds for the privilege of keeping the cat or they would sue (for what exactly was unspecified.)  At this point it was clear this was a scam, albeit a bizarre one.

Someone on the bola thread suggested reporting the letters to the local bar association. I ignored the first two but when they kept arriving I went ahead and did so.  I assume the bar association took some kind of action because the next letter I received was basically the scammer raging 'how dare you'.  This was the first letter that contained an actual threat against my safety.

So, to cut this already way too long story short, I filed a police report.  After some additional letters my cat now has a no contact order.  Okay, okay, it's in my name, but we all know it's really for the cat.  

I will say the threats were of the more creative, less actionable sort, but I'm hopeful this will truly put an end to it.  This is honestly the single dumbest thing I've ever gone through.

My cat continues not to care.

weonlyhirewomen,2019-03-14 03:31:15+00:00,"(UT) Two weeks ago, we hired a gal to help cover for another girl on my team who is going on maternity leave later this year. Yesterday, the girl we hired to cover informed us she is also pregnant and due about 3 weeks after the first girl.","I'm a manager for my company. I'm fairly new to managing, and learning lots and growing everyday. I love my job and the people I work with. There is girl on my team, let's call her Susan. She is very smart and hard working, but attendance is terrible. Just the worst. She can't get to work before 10 am to save her life most days. But when she is at work, she kills it. She just can't get there on time though and struggles to get her 40 hours in each week. 

I report to our controller and assistant controller pretty regularly on things and this gal gets brought up quite often in our meetings. I stand up for her all the time, telling them that while yes her attendance could be better, her work gets done and she is smart enough to take on just about anything you throw at her. We've had lots of debates though over several months on whether she should be let go or not. Then recently she annouced she was pregnant and that changed everything.

As you can imagine, her attendance got even worst. After several weeks of really struggling, she finally she got on FMLA, which is essentially a free pass for her to come to work whenever she wants. It's good for. She seems less stressed, and it protects her job, but at the cost of eating away at the time she can take off after the baby is born. When ever she doesn't get enough hours in  each week, her FMLA time is used to cover the gap. She comes in very late now every day and is just burning through her FMLA.

We finally decided to hire someone else to pick up all the slack of her not being there enough. And not just a temp, but a full time position. The controller and assistant controller did all the interviewing, and decided to hire this nice gal. Let's call her Pam. Pam was looking for a new job cause she was getting laid off from her current job. She is equally smart, hard working, and so far has great attendance and work ethic. She was told in the interview that we were needing an additional person specifically due to Susan going on maternity leave. She was even told roughly when Susan's maternity leave would be.

Everything was going great for the first week, but then Pam let me and assistant controller know that she is actually pregnant too and due 3 weeks after Susan. She tells us she feels really guilty about it but assures us that she intends to work up to her due date and take a short maternity leave. She is young, and it's her first baby. As a father of several kids myself, I know it's just a guessing game on how things will really go down. We thanked her for letting us know, stayed positive and supportive, and went back to work.

I personally have some mixed feelings about it. One hand, it's kinda crappy that she took the job knowing she was pregnant and due close to the same time as the other gal. But, putting myself in her shoes, would I do the same thing? If I was pregnant, about to get laid off, desprate for a job, I probably wouldn't tell employers I was pregnant in an interview. Honestly, I'm surprised she told us now and didn't wait until it was painfully obvious. I told the assistant controller I was actually ok with it all.  Her attendance and work ethic are great and worth it imo. So I volunteered to pick up both Susan's and Pam's workloads while they are out leave when the time comes. I'm salaried, so it wouldn't cost the company anything more for me to work overtime to t things done, which I have no problem doing. Especially if in the long run I get a great employee out of it afterwards. And even if one or both of the girls don't come back from maternity leave, then eh, ok, whatever. At least I can have a clear conscience and  say I tried my best to make it work and we can find someone else then.

When the controller found out though, he was very upset. Of course he feels cheated about it and is mad that she didn't tell him she was pregnant during the interview. And despite my offer to cover and push to make the whole thing work, he said he wanted to think about the whole situation for a few days and see what wants to do. 

I don't think legally he can fire either of them currently. Maybe I'm wrong though. I think the best thing I can do is stay positive and supportive, be reasonably accommodating to both gals, and try and convince my controller that everything is going to be ok in there long run. But man is it going to suck if my controller decides to fire either of them. Is there legally anything else I (or my company) can or should do right now for this situation?",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/b0vgnz/ut_two_weeks_ago_we_hired_a_gal_to_help_cover_for/,legaladvice,1315,139,0.0

Can they do this?,"My roommate’s boyfriend is a pos who decided that I should no longer live in the apt. I just got home and see that he has installed a keychain so that the door won’t open all the way. I am trying to force it open and he calls the cops who show up insanely quick. The police arrive and I explain that I live in the apt and that the boyfriend does not. One of the police apparently spoke to him and he claims that I don’t live there. So the police have now told me that I can’t ‘break in’ to MY OWN APARTMENT and are threatening  to arrest me if I don’t leave. 

I’ve called my landlord who is on his way here but I am posting to see if the cops have any right in this situation. My roommate is currently out of town and I didn’t even know her boyfriend had her key. I have shown the police a copy of my lease on my phone, shown them the fact that I have a key, shown them the fact that MY NAME IS ON THE MAILBOX and they are still refusing to let me go into my home.

CheerFairy,2019-03-13 02:29:01+00:00,I am afraid for my life and those of my children.,"My husband is active duty Navy. We have been married 11 years and have three boys together, ages 5, 2, and 2 months old.

He's always been verbally and emotionally abusive to me but lately it's escalated. In December he got mad out of nowhere while driving and began driving erratically. I thought we were going to crash. He pounded the steering wheel and broke the blinker handle thing off. When we got home he screamed at our 5 year old and kicked a hole in our wall. He'd never done that before. The next day I faked a pregnancy issue and had him take me to the hospital. I told my midwife what happened and asked for a social worker. CPS was called and investigated about two weeks right around Christmas. They closed the case despite me telling them that he'd said he would rather we all be dead than I leave him again. (We were separated for Sox months over a year ago.) They said he wasn't an immediate danger after speaking to our five year old and him having told them he was afraid of his dad. Since the case has closed my husband's behavior has not improved. I caught him pushing my two year old over on the sidewalk after he ran off. He grabbed my five year olds arm and shook it when he wouldn't drop his DS and left bruises. He has screamed at all of us and hinted that he would not let me leave alive.

We just moved into a new apartment and now he is underway until next week. I feel like this is a good time to do something but am scared of reporting him since nothing happened last time and because of the murder/suicide hints.

The only family I have is in Hawaii. We are in California. He has told me he will say I'm kidnapping of I try to go back with the kids.

I have no other family or friends

I have money set aside in cash, but no access to his income and he took me off our joint account last year.

When we were separated last year it was from an infidelity issue and I had found pictures of him naked under a tree by a park Inside our military housing. I don't know who took the pictures but I sent then to his command thinking they'd force him to get counseling. Instead they told him I was causing his career trouble. They didn't help us get access to income either and ultimately I came back last March because we were about to be homeless. I then got pregnant.

Anyway, I want to save my kids. Please tell me how.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/b0gnel/i_am_afraid_for_my_life_and_those_of_my_children/,legaladvice,7828,118,0.0

\*Courts based in upstate NY\*

Over the last almost 8 years me and my wife have been  together her parents always have despised me cause i was a punk city boy and my wife was a good country girl. We moved in after 6 months and have been happy together since. we got married back in 2015 so we are coming up on a 4 year anniversary and things got better for awhile until we bought our first house and i got a job where i started making a lot of money. me and my wife now live a very comfortable life nice cars house etc. 

Back on thanksgiving of last year is when shit hit the fan. Her mother said some very hurtful stuff about me and my wife to my brother in laws girlfriend, my wife and her are very close so she tells her everything and once the beans were spilled my wife confronted her mother about it. Her mom made every excuse under the sun instead of just saying sorry she was wrong (we know she said it because there was text proof). We haven't talked to her only once or twice since thanksgiving.

Today we received a letter in the mail from her county court suing for grandparent rights everything i have read they can only sue if we are ""unfit"" to be parents. My wife and i don't have any alcohol, drug problems, or trouble with the law we have been happily married for almost 4 years and our kids are well taken care of no debt etc. We also never once stated ever she could not see the children not verbally or over text. We just sold our house yesterday expected close is early May and then we are moving to South Carolina this has been a plan for years and we finally acted on it back in December. 

Does she have any ground to stand on? Does NY have any laws to that effect where they could force us to give them the kids for visitation? Can this stop our move from happening and screw up the sale of my house? Any advice is much appreciated.

JoeKingBro,2019-03-11 15:38:03+00:00,Vet is threatening us if we euthanize,"My wife and I made the decision to put our Beagle down. We had her eyes removed last year under recommendation from the vet. They were bulging out of her head and were in danger of exploding. This is somewhat common I guess and was due to pressure build up. So she's been blind for the past year but she's managed to adapt. She's been refusing to use her right hind leg for a while but it suddenly got really bad where she would go down the stairs on her belly. We took her to the vet and it was determined that perhaps her nail was digging into her pad and after her nails were trimmed she may begin to use it again. Well, we didn't buy that and took her to a different vet where it was determined that she had a spinal injury. She had severe muscle loss in her back legs and she also had a hematoma in her ear, which is basically blood vessels leaking and causing her ear to puff up. The cost would be well over a thousand dollars, and we just paid about a thousand dollars to have the surgery for her eye removal. She's about 11 years old and we can't really afford to pay that sort of money. We also feel like she's had a great life and she just isn't having such a great life anymore. She sleeps all day and is in great discomfort and pain most of the time. The original vet, who missed the spinal injury and tried to have us schedule the hematoma surgery called and told us to reconsider. They even threatened to sue us if we had her put down and initially refused to send the dogs records to the new vet. The new vet completely agrees with the euthanasia. Even with the surgery, it may not give the ability to use her back legs very well and we would have to carry her outside to go the the bathroom and she would most likely start peeing in the house because of the increased water intake, because of the medication, and the lack of mobility. So, she's blind, most likely disabled for life, and would probably require follow-up surgeries for her ear. We're feeling very guilty about it, but we think it's the right decision from a cost and Quality of life perspective. The original vet, who missed the spinal injury and attributed it to a long nail continues to call the new vet demanding the records for the visit with the new vet that identified the spinal injury and is threatening to sue both the new vet and us if we have her euthanized. Aside from posting on yelp and the local Facebook pages, do we have a recourse in dealing with this vet? It really upset my wife and I and put undue stress on us during this difficult time. My goal here is to determine if there is any legal action this vet can take against us and is there anything we can do besides blow up yelp and Facebook to try and hurt their practice?

Thank you to everyone pointing out i was an idiot and i should have called the police to make a report.

A long story short i went to station made a report, gave them all the details i had along with showing them a copy of the security camera footage of both incidents that my landlord was kind enough to send to me. Thee police officer didn't seem to really care from my impression, but he made a report. No one to my knowledge ever came out or anything. 

Anyways today the father, and son came to my door today and he basically apologized for accusing me of lying, and made his son apologize to me (awkward..), and gave me a bag consisting of my clothing. I told him i didn't particularly want to that stuff again, and was going to throw it out (just the idea of keeping it made me disgusted). So the father kindly gave me the cash value for a rough estimate of the items and then some, then told me if stuff goes missing to come to him first.

So I would like to thank everyone that gave me advice on how to help. It helped ease my mind greatly. Now, on to the details!

Following what everyone suggested, I went to LARA (Licensing and Regulatory Affairs) and reported my old place of employment for not paying me around a month worth of checks after I left. I tried one last time to get my money from my old boss. When I asked him why he wouldn't give it to me he said and quote ""You fucked me over, now I'm going to fuck you over.""

That royally pissed me off. I felt hopeless when I read that. Knowing someone intentionally was hurting my personal funds because I left his company. A shame. But that's when I found out I was still apart of their email system.

Now I know this sounds bad, but they kept payroll on the email and I was looking to see if they were even planning in paying even though LARA was just about to begin investigating.

This is when I heard from the IRS saying I was misclassified as a sub contractor when I was really supposed to be a W-2 employee. I found my records in the email and sure enough, I signed a W-2 when I started.

Essentially the investigation ended up concluding and my old boss has to pay LARA back along with some hefty fines. His shop is actually set to close in a matter of weeks. Karma is a bitch.

Around 7 months ago, I decided to install small audio and video cameras in my apartment because I live in a sketchy area. My friends and I are about to graduate and so we’re not always at home. 

Around 3 days ago, one of my best friends, Geneva, accused another one of my best friends, Alex, of rape. It was a quite brutal attack, she’s been hospitalized and undergoing care, we’ve been told that she’s very delicate right now and not to question her or prod her for answers. She had to have surgery due to one of her various wounds. 

From her hospital bed, Geneva exposed Alex as a rapist to the group chat and sent screenshots of the threatening messages with time and date stamps he’d sent her that night. He was in custody and had no way of defending himself against any more accusations. 

The problem with Geneva’s story is that I was with Alex the night he supposedly raped her. He walks into my apartment on camera (4:15), shakes his phone, the first thing out of his mouth is “Sorry, I couldn’t get any texts, my phone died. I’m not gonna charge it, let’s have a tech free night”, and he puts it in a cubby. He never touches it again that night (confirmed by multiple cameras) and it has been since there since police arrests him. The first of his threatening messages to Geneva is sent at 5:00 pm which couldn’t possibly be him. 

The cameras that night caught his every move, he’s never off camera except for a bathroom trip that lasted less than 2 minutes, I’m not saying that something didn’t happen to her, but I am saying that it wasn’t Alex. Because unless Alex expertly tampered with my tapes, made himself appear in two places at once, and had one version of himself rape her at a club and the other make lasagna at my house, he didn’t rape her in the way she claimed it went down. 

I also know Geneva’s past, she moved to the city in order to make herself a new person, but she’s into self diagnosing herself with various severe mental and physical illnesses, she’s got a history with false claims, being vindictive, and flat out lying, and she’s had a long history of serious self harm. I loved her when we were younger, now I’m warier. 

Geneva has been iron on the fact that the rape happened on the day and at the time in question, this has never changed, she doesn’t know that there’s proof that Alex was far away from her. 

Alex was raised upper class by a wealthy family and he has everything to lose. He’s worked so hard to succeed and he’s just now started to succeed in life. I don’t know what’s happening but it seems like he may even get expelled from our university for sexual misconduct. 

I have this tape, the police haven’t questioned me, he’s been god knows where locked up, he’s been denied bail due to the brutality of the attack, he’s been being ripped to shreds by our friend group, accused of all sorts of things, it’s been especially brutal for him and bad for everyone involved in this drama. 

How do I come forward with this tape? Should I get a lawyer? Should I make multiple copies of the tape? I’m absolutely freaking out and have been avoiding Geneva but she’s been texting the group telling us not to talk to the cops without her permission because she doesn’t want her mental health impacted.

angry_girl1001,2019-03-09 16:52:01+00:00,My school suspended me for lesbian sex; forced us (as minors) to go into graphic sexual detail about it; and forced my girlfriend to come out to her parents - isn't this illegal? Is there anything I can do about it?,"This happened three years ago, and it's only now hitting me how f-ed up the situation was. I can't stand the thought of them getting away with it, but don't know what to do. TL;DR at the end.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's what happened.

I (20F) had just turned 17 at the time, and my girlfriend Bella was 16. We'd both just joined the same boarding school together in England for sixth form. All the boarding girls slept in the same building, and we had roommates.

Bella and I had just officially got together, and were head over heels - and young, and very stupid. So we made the unfortunate decision to have sex at night while her roommate was asleep. This roommate, Anna, didn't wake up, so - being naive, hormonal and cocky teenagers - we kept doing it. And after a few more times, the inevitable happened: Anna woke up during... but we didn't notice. Anna was my friend, but was very emotionally immature and unintelligent; rather than confront us, I later found out she'd been upset and confused and told the college Nurse what had happened.

When my own roommate told me she'd been asked by if I'd been sleeping in my own bed at night, everyone knew something awful was about to happen. I was called into the office the next day to be confronted by the vice principal, *Mr. M*, and the head of boarding, *Mrs. P*. (The school and the boarding facilities were run independently, since one was free and the other was private.)

This part is a blur, since it was so horrible that I've tried to forget most of it. 

The questions began broadly - if I'd been sleeping in my own bed; where I'd been instead; where the ""love bites"" on my neck were from. They asked if I was dating Bella. I tried to deny everything at first, but they then told me that they already knew what had happened, and that I had to tell them the truth for the written records. I started piecing together what had happened and realised there was little point in lying.

I was terrified and humiliated. These people were in their 40s and I didn't know them at all. Their questions became pointed. ""**Did you kiss her?**"" ""Yes."" ""**Did you touch her breasts?**"" ""Yes."" ""**Had you taken her top off?**"" ""Yes."" ""**Did you take more of her clothes off? Was she naked?**"" ""**Did you kiss her naked breasts?**"" ""**What did you do next? Did you go further?**"" On, and on. They made me write down all of the things I answered. *I kissed her and touched her breasts. I took her top off and kissed her breasts.* And so forth. I tried to lie and downplay what I'd done. I couldn't bear it - I couldn't even look at them.

I wasn't allowed to talk to Bella, and she got called in straight after me and subjected to the same questions and treatment. They were merciless. I don't think she had the strength to lie: she was just broken by the shame, the horror and humiliation of it. I was trying not to break down. Soon after, we were called in individually again and informed we'd be internally suspended for three days. Knowing that my mother was extremely violent, they let me get away with only calling my dad, which I had to do in front of them.

But they forced my girlfriend to call her mother. They insisted it was protocol, and again made her do it in front of them, even though she pleaded not to. She was already a wreck - and now they were making her out herself to her Catholic, Italian mother on the phone, under these circumstances. She wasn't ready for it, and neither was her mother. It was already traumatic for me - and was so much worse for her. She developed a phobia of sex and it led to our break-up half a year later following a relationship that - no matter how much we loved each other - was inseparable from the trauma.

The school did nothing about it despite the outrage of its staff and students. I even personally confronted the headmaster, who covered his tracks by claiming they'd only handed her the phone to tell her parents about the suspension, and hadn't forced her to say why. There was absolutely no mention of the horrifically invasive, graphic sexual details we'd been forced to go into. In the end he just thanked me for exposing the loophole in the rules that didn't explicitly ban same-sex sexual contact, and sent me on my way. We went through the suspension, both at school and at boarding (even though we shouldn't have been punished for a boarding transgression at school). Everyone knew what had happened, but nothing was done.

Now that I'm older and understand how the world works more, I can't possibly imagine that what they did was legal. Making Bella out herself could be in a legal grey area - but that degree of forced sexual interrogation can't possibly be legal, especially since we were minors.

I need to remain anonymous and need to keep my ex out of this - she's definitely too traumatised to even want to think about this again. But the people involved still work there and still maintain their positions. Absolutely nothing has been done - they just covered it up, never even acknowledging what they did.

* This was illegal, right?
* Is there any way I can make them face some form of justice?
* Is there anything within my legal power to do about this?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR school found out I'd had sex with my girlfriend in the boarding house and suspended us for it. The problem is that they made us describe and write down the explicit sexual things we'd done with each other. When suspending us, they also made my girlfriend call her mother and out herself. We were minors at the time.

Dddagne,2019-03-08 14:54:58+00:00,I think my brother's ex girlfriend has Munchausen by Proxy. Her toddler is becoming more ill. Help,"Thank-you all in advance... this is Hamilton, ON, Canada.

&amp;#x200B;

Brief background: my brother began dating a teenaged girl with a toddler last year. I honestly would not have known she had a toddler except for her having mentioned it once. Over time, it became more and more clear that this girl is highly manipulative and untruthful. She somehow wormed her way into living with my brother and parents almost immediately, claimed to be going to college + have a part time job nearby. Having this girl as part of the family was very confusing: I literally would forget she was there because for hours at a time she would say LITERALLY NOTHING until she told some kind of crisis story, and they always seemed made up. Fight with my brother? Car crash. My mom annoyed that she was staying over every night? Sister came at her with a baseball bat. Brother finds out about shocking $50K in debt? Baby daddy extorted her and she has no legal recourse. Just all kinds of slightly unbelievable shit, but nothing major. This culminated with: Brother having misgivings about relationship? Ovarian cancer. At this point, I sat my family down and pointed out all the problems in her stories, and voiced my belief that she was neither in college nor had a job, and that she most definitely was making up the cancer (this I knew for sure based on the ridiculous treatment regimen she described). My brother confirmed all 3 of these things, (not before she claimed that they had mistaken a pregnancy for ovarian cancer) and broke it off. 

&amp;#x200B;

A sponsored post (SPONSORED POST. for more exposure, people) showed up on my page yesterday. It was a little girl in a full body cast. The little girl looked familiar, and holy shit, it's my brother's ex's daughter. I took the clickbait, and it lead me to the ex's page. Her whole profile is full of public posts about her daughter's MULTIPLE surgeries, rashes, and gastrointestinal issues. These are some of the most common issues that Munchausen's parents report in their children. I'm sure you know by now where I'm going with this. I'm absolutely terrified for that little girl. One of the posts describes ""third degree burns"" caused by ""fungi"" that the doctor found underneath her cast when the mother brought the girl into the emergency room YET AGAIN. The whole page is full of selfies with the little girl, and selfies in surgical scrubs. I know I have no evidence, but my gut is telling me that something horrible is happening. She's getting tons of attention for this.

&amp;#x200B;

I called CAS, but they were rather testy with me on the phone (can't blame them, I have no proof of this), and said they will follow up with me ""if in the future we receive evidence worth investigating"". My question is, can I somehow alert the doctors that care for her at the local children's hospital? Could I get sued for alerting them? Is that defamation if I have no proof? I know where toddler gets treated because the mother is always geotagging.

Moved in to the apartment at the start of January, since then i have been convinced that someone is stealing my underwear/bra/etc. Every floor has a pair of washer/dryer units, and since moving in i have had almost a dozen different things just disappear from the wash or dryer. The room is so tiny that there is no where to sit, aside from sitting on top of one of the machines, so it makes it very hard to wait for it. 

Two weeks ago i went and bought a bunch of new things, and when i went to go remove stuff from the washer i noticed that several things i had just bought went missing. Armed with this and the fact it was early Saturday morning, i went to our landlord and she was able to tell me during the 35 minutes of washing the only person who entered was my next door neighbors son. 

Now at this point i was furious and confronted the parents. The parents called me a liar, and basically told me off. They absolutely refused to believe me, however since confronting them i have had nothing go missing since then. 

Today i put laundry on and started cleaning my unit, when i went to go drop trash off, i checked the laundry and discovered our neighbors son going the dryer i was using. I again confronted the parents, and they immediately started screaming at me for harassing their son, and threatened to call the police on me for harassing their son, and threatened to sue me for ""slandering"" their son by implying he is a pervert. 

My question is, does this count as theft and can i go to the police and file a complaint? I don't want my clothing back, at this point.

Live_Impression,2019-03-06 22:48:26+00:00,[Australia] Insane neighbour calling the cops every time I order Ubereats,"I'm in my mid 20's, in a 3 bedroom household in an upper class suburb. The street I live on is 95% elderly people, the rest are pretty standard families with children. There's no single, young people except for me. I share the house with one guy, and we stick out like a sore thumb I guess. We are not a couple.

&amp;#x200B;

When we moved in, the elderly lady came across the street to introduce herself. She was incredibly polite to begin with, however one Saturday night I had some people over for my birthday, around 25 of us. We had some drinks (inside) before heading out into town to hit up some bars at around 10:30pm. The house is quite big, so people were spread out around the place and nobody really had to talk over one another, and we only had a pissy speaker (think a little pill speaker about the size of your forearm) playing some music in the kitchen that doesn't go loud at all. It also doesn't have any bass to it so you can't hear it thumping from outside. The only time people were outside was if they were smoking, and even then I asked them to keep it down. Two days after this I received a letter in the mail from this woman telling us that we were disruptive (noise cutoff is 12am) and that there were too many cars on the street. I don't have that many people around at once very often so we haven't had any problems since.

&amp;#x200B;

However a week after we received the letter was when the calls to the police started, and our neighbour made it very clear that she was keeping an eye on us. The first time I thought it was out of the blue, however I noted it down. The officers stated that they had received a tip that I had a drug dealer come to my house. The next time it happened was 13 minutes after I had received an UberEats order. I thought okay, strange, but went on with my day. Over time I realised that every single damn time I order UberEats, the police get called. And every single time, the neighbour across the road is standing out in her garden, trying to peek through our gate from across the road. And every single time, it was a tip off about drugs. To see if my theory was correct, I ordered UberEats twice in one day. The police were called twice. They are never called on days when we don't order UberEats. I've tried explaining to her that the people coming to my house are delivering food, not drugs. Apparently that doesn't mean much to our neighbour. 

&amp;#x200B;

The cops are becoming fed up. We have a good chat though, they like to know what I'm eating and if it's any good or not /shrug. 

&amp;#x200B;

Is there anything I can do to stop these frivolous calls? I'm sick of it and my housemate is sick of it. I don't want to have to move, as I love the neighbourhood so I'm willing to exhaust every other option before it comes to that.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/ay55d9/australia_insane_neighbour_calling_the_cops_every/,legaladvice,18886,154,0.0

Both my parents are former Paramedics who have worked in the field for decades in southern Ontario, Canada. A few years ago they both went on disability due to PTSD they developed on the job. It's currently the only source of income they have.

They've been trying to enjoy their time away from work as best they can, though it seems like even outside of work they can't catch a break. To get away from all the stress they've been doing some travelling, and my mum has been posting pictures from their travels on Facebook.

My mother didn't have her privacy settings restricted to friends only, so apparently her FB account was found by the insurance company. The insurance company is now claiming that my parents don't have PTSD because there are photos of them having a good time on their travels, and they want to take them off disability payments.

I just moved (Nevada) and it was just me and a couple friends unloading, so we left some things on the street next to the moving truck while we did heavier items like desks, shelves, etc. as a team. 

I came out after bringing in some more boxes to find a guy had loaded my couch into the bed of his truck. 

I ran up to him, and explained I own the couch. He said since it was on the street corner it’s public property and he’s within his rights to take it. He drove off before I could block his car. I did get his license plate and went to the police to make a report but they asked me if it was in fact on the curb and I said it was, but it was also pretty obviously next to a moving truck, it was wrapped up and surrounded by boxes. (And, I told him it was mine and I was moving.) But the police didn’t say anything that inspired hope. 

The couch has been in the family three generations now and while it probably isn’t worth more than a few hundred bucks, it is sentimentally priceless. 

Is there anything else I can do or further ways to escalate this to get my couch back?

McBrungus,2019-03-05 14:06:17+00:00,"UPDATE: Un-permitted contractor next door did $5,000+ of damage to my home, contractor and homeowner won't pay or provide insurance information","Hi r/legaladvice. Just wanted to provide a ""thank you"" for all of the responses and an update on the situation detailed in my [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/atin99/unpermitted_contractor_next_door_did_5000_of/).

&amp;#x200B;

Since so many people suggested we file a claim with our homeowner's insurance, I gave that a shot. However, according to the adjuster I spoke to about our claim, our policy apparently has an exclusion for ""faulty workmanship"". Even though it's completely insane, I was told that our insurance company would not cover the damage or provide any legal assistance because the damage was caused by someone doing work on the house next door. The adjuster told me this is a very common clause in insurance policies. Basically, all insurance companies are completely manned by psychopaths and capitalism is an endless nightmare that will surely swallow us all.

&amp;#x200B;

So now it looks like I'm back to square one. The police have suggested that I try to find information about the contractor and homeowner through the Licensing and Inspection Department to pursue legal action, but previous attempts at that came up with basically zilch aside from a suggestion to hire a lawyer. So I guess I'll try and find a lawyer that will take this case, although my previous attempts to reach out to lawyers about this issue have not been promising at all.

They have been constantly harassing me, my family, her family, her friends, her coworkers, and her neighbors by calling daily. They camped out at the hospital grounds and followed us around, and some even snuck upstairs using our names, which is definitely illegal. We called the police and hospital security multiple times but by the time they got there, the reporters ran off.

It has been such a hard time for her and everyone close to her. The last thing we need is to be followed and harassed. Finally, after the 5th call, I asked the reporters to find it in their hearts to take down the photos of my friend that were partially exposing her private parts and lost limbs, so she can maintain her dignity.

Of course, these ""reporters"" are the actual scum of the earth, devoid of a soul. The one I spoke with said they would remove the photos and stop calling. They did neither. The photos are still up months later and they called for another 2 days. I told them that I did not want anything I said to be published and that I am an anonymous friend. Instead, they made up quotes, saying that I said she was healing well when she was not. 

Even though I never game them my full name, they already had it and plastered it all over the article, including under a photo of her with another made-up quote. After it was published, I got 50+ calls and messages from acquaintances berating me for sending photos to the media, when I did no such thing. I was nowhere near the accident. That took another few days to clear up but I felt that was slanderous and purposefully misleading.

[Update two](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9s74jd/update_buying_a_house_sellers_daughter_commits/)

Well, it has been a wild ride. After my last post, I met with my attorney, who immediately sent out the paperwork to get the eviction started. It gave the squatters 30 days to get out before we started court proceedings. The 30 days came and went without much word from anyone. 

After the 30 days, I went to the property and it was empty at the time. I broke in through a window, had a locksmith come out to change all of the locks, disconnected the garage door, and barred any other possible entrance to the property. They somehow got back in the next day. Being completely over it, and on the advice of my lawyer, I boarded up the windows the next time I came by and it was empty (two days later). I posted a notice to contact my attorney and left it at that. 

A few days later, my lawyer got a call from their lawyer (a family friend), threatening suit. My lawyer fired off all evidence that they had no lease, no claim, and no common sense. It further outlined that everything was in my name, they abandoned the property within the 30 days notice, I was willing to go to any means necessary to go after their assets, and they were insane. After that email I haven't heard from the seller, squatters, or their attorney. I assume it is because their lawyer was doing them a favor and didn't know all of the facts. 

In the two months following this, I moved in. I lived in a full blown construction zone, and let the contractors work around me. I weighed my options on what I could do as far as recouping my losses. I found that the squatters (as I assumed) have nothing of value, and beyond a small claims suit it is not worth my time. I found a forwarding address for the seller, but decided not to go after him unless he makes a move first. I really don't want to spend $20,000+ chasing down damage that equate to less than that. I am in negotiation with the broker to settle. If they refuse, I will definitely follow up with suit as I feel it is my best bet to recoup my lost money.

Construction just finished a few days ago and the house is gorgeous. Right now, I am sitting in my new living room with my wife and kid, watching movies and enjoying life. Justice wasn't really served, and shitty people don't always get their comeuppance, but it is what it is; you can't squeeze blood out of a turnip. This will be my final update, as I am sure nobody cares about a meager settlement, or lack there of. Thanks for everything, LA.

We just finished up with our initial meeting with the attorney. We all agree that we are going to try to get an annulment. The guy has such a common name that it’s going to be close to impossible to find him. They will do a search, followed by a publication. Then the petition for annulment will be filed. 

Annulment is best case scenario because it will be like it never happened and we can go about our lives.   He thinks she has a good chance of it being approved since they never lived together, filed taxes together or even consummated the marriage. 

The tricky thing is if the judge doesn’t approve the annulment. Because of our marriage, adoption of our kids, tax filings, etc., we might be in for a world of shit if she has to file for divorce. Let’s hope it doesn’t come to that.

He’s 16. He’s not a violent person. Literally not a teacher or person dislikes him. I’m scared he’s completely ruined his life because he’s naive and was being so so so stupid. The only thing he has against him, character wise, is that he doesn’t finish homework a lot, and has been getting tested for ADHD after depression therapy/meds weren’t working for him. 

I know this is a serious situation, and should treated as such. I’m scared, and so is my family; all I know is what my dad has texted right as I started my shift about 30 minutes ago.

schoolpnutbtr2828,2019-02-26 02:08:43+00:00,(Update) School kept giving our son peanuts even though hes allergic. Lawyers are expensive...,"Original post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9x6enr/son_has_a_peanut_allergy_school_continues_to_give/

The past 3 months have been long and expensive but it's finally resolved. Now I can't go into a lot of the details after but I can go over some of the details that happened during.

We contacted a few attorneys and finally found one we were comfortable with and then the fun started. We first sat down with the principal and teacher with our attorney and he didn't say anything except he needs to talk to someone else and not us.

Our attorney then began collecting documents and statements/affidavits from our pediatrician, another doctor and even got another opinion. Then he began having us get documents from the school, some of which they said we couldn't have but our lawyer assured us we could have them. So he sent the school district some nice letters and a few phone calls later we had everything. Talking to our insurance and the hospital was the easiest part of this entire thing which I thought would be more complicated and our insurance even offered their attorneys services to our attorney which turned out to be quite helpful with some of the other issues that came up along the way.

He spent about a month going over everything, talking to doctors, getting more statements and reaching out to other parents etc. During this time our child was moved from his normal classroom and placed in a special needs classroom. Something we did not agree to or with, our child has no developmental problems and an allergy hardly is a special need. 

So our lawyer then starts having us request more documents, same act with the school and he had to send off letters and phone calls to get the new stuff related to him being put into a special needs classroom. The lawyer began sending letters about how the school district is punishing our child with the move to a more restrictive classroom and a different curriculum and magically the next day he's back in a normal classroom.

Finally after 3 months of mostly playing the game with the school district getting them to give us the paperwork and requests they are legally required to did we all finally sit down with the school districts attorney and our attorney.

Now I can't go into a lot of the details but I can tell you they settled without us moving onto the next step of having our meetings in a courtroom. Lawyers are expensive, and so are hospital bills. I just hope all of this doesn't make our child a target for the rest of the year. We are going to be moving and changing jobs over the summer hopefully. 

Thanks for all your help and advice guys and girls, the plans everyone brought up for us to look over was incredibly important because we already had them on file with the school.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/autm4i/update_school_kept_giving_our_son_peanuts_even/,legaladvice,15703,4,0.0

Reasonable_Yam,2019-02-22 15:29:12+00:00,"[Update] Ohio, Dr. flagged my medical records with anxiety because she doesn't think my neurologist is treating a real disease","Thank you to everyone who helped with this.

The short version is that I was misdiagnosed and then injured by doctors who were not familiar with their computer systems or my diagnosis. As my health was fragile at the time I had multiple emergency room visits, and the error was compounding. This resulted in me being involuntarily placed in a psychiatric unit for an all-day hold more than once, and being refused adequate treatment for an established diagnosis.

Based on the advice given here as well as several very kind private messages, I contacted my lawyer. I was informed that the hospital's records department had violated my rights to correct my records. My lawyer said that she would be willing to begin speaking with the hospital's risk management team in the event I was not able to get my records corrected, but thankfully the advice given here was good enough to get things moving.

Here is what I did. I filed complaints online at the joint commission's website for the injury to my wrist. The joint commission decided to investigate that claim. I was not given a definitive answer as to what they had decided but it does seem that the hospital is going to be monitored. I also filed complaints with the department of health and human services about discrimination because I feel I was not treated correctly based on being young and female. I feel that I also had some discriminatory treatment because I had been dismissed as a psychiatric patient. Even if I was a psychiatric patient, which I'm not, I still deserved adequate medical care for the existing medical diagnosis. I also noted the hospital repeatedly violating my right to have my records amended. 

I also contacted my insurance company. I originally hadn't really had much luck getting through, so I decided to ask for the fraud department. While there may not be outright fraud, the person I reached was very knowledgeable, and actually did find some billing issues that were serious enough for the insurance company to engage. I made the case that the repeated referrals to a psychiatric unit when I did not need psychiatric care were extremely expensive, and that the hospital system in question was continuing to do this against the advice of my neurologist. I also noted that my neurologist had sent me for a psychiatric referral and a mental health issue had been ruled out. I also noted the hospital refusing to add copies of my neurologists recommendations to my medical history, which included a care plan that was much cheaper than committing me to psychiatric unit. I also mentioned that my insurance company was paying for physical therapy for an injury caused by the hospital system. During this conversation I learned that I had also apparently been inappropriately referred for treatment that I did not need, and this is where the insurance company has chosen to investigate. The insurance company suggested filing a grievance in the event that I could not have my issues corrected. They suggested contacting the American medical association for advice since this can vary by state. they said that if I was interested I could be referred to case management in a case manager would examine my records very closely in order to find any further billing issues that could be investigated. While insurance companies are usually demonized in these kinds of forums, I found the person I spoke with was genuinely helpful and seems genuinely concerned about what was happening to me.

After having all of these conversations my lawyer suggested that I give my doctor's office one last chance to correct the problem.Since my repeated attempts to interface with patient advocacy, my doctor's office, and medical records were ignored, I decided to document everything in a format that would hold up in court. I sent my doctor MyChart message and informed them that I was going to do the things I had outlined above, and that I had specifically chosen to use a MyChart message, since it would be attached to my medical record, and would be easily documented in a lawsuit. 

My issues were resolved that day, without my realizing it, while I was actually in the process of messaging several of you back and forth. The flags to have me committed in the event I went to the emergency room again, which I confirm were actually there, and is actually illegal, have been removed. The note about anxiety as an active health issue has also been removed. The reference to the correct diagnosis, POTS and Ehlers Danlos, was added to every single visit I have had with that health system. While I have not been able to have the text referring to an anxiety disorder removed from previous encounter notes, I am now aware that I can submit a statement of disagreement, and have that attached to the top of those records. The hospital's records department has falsely informed me that any records were subject to the discretion of their medical team and could be dismissed. In the event that they continue ignoring me, I have grounds for further complaints to the department of health and human services.

Below are links to the agencies where I filed my complaints. This is unfortunately not a terribly uncommon story in the chronic illness community. It's unfortunate that the only way to get things fixed is to put up this kind of fight. However since this doctor was actually on a list of names that I got from a disease specific support group I felt obligated. Since some of you are unfortunately in a similar situation, you'll be delighted to know that you can file these complaints for free online by yourself! 

While it's extremely frustrating and time-consuming to do this while you are ill, it also puts you in a very good position in the event you decide to file a lawsuit later. Unfortunately that kind of threat seems to be the only way to fix this kind of problem. These health systems can actually move pretty fast if they're properly motivated.

McBrungus,2019-02-22 15:08:28+00:00,"Un-permitted contractor next door did $5,000+ of damage to my home, contractor and homeowner won't pay or provide insurance information"," 

Hi [r/legaladvice](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice), hoping someone here can give me some further insight into how I should proceed.

I live in Philadelphia, PA, and my wife and I own a rowhome. In the spring of 2018, a contractor started doing a complete gutting and renovation on the unoccupied house next door, and in July the city put a stop work order on the house. These guys were doing some pretty enormous renovations; they tore down the old kitchen (an addition on the back that caused all of the problems to come), built a new addition, took out a section of the front wall, and apparently were digging in the basement which could apparently collapse the house and make our house completely unstable, and were doing all of this without any permits or inspections whatsoever.

&amp;#x200B;

Shortly after work stopped was when we noticed the water. First, our neighbors on the other side of the unoccupied home woke us up in the middle of the night, telling us that their basement had flooded with a couple feet of water leaking in from the unoccupied house, and that we should check ours. Fortunately our basement was dry, but not long afterwards we started to get water leaking into our basement when it rained (at its worst, I shop vac'd up about 14 gallons of water out of our basement during a storm). Our basement had always gotten a little water during heavy rains but \*nothing close\* to what we started seeing after the construction next door.

&amp;#x200B;

As the summer went on, we contacted the city hoping they could give us some guidance on what to do. Construction next door had halted, the guys doing the work hadn't been seen for months, and we started to get water soaking the drywall in our kitchen and the exposed brick on one of our walls, causing mold to develop. They weren't any help, and eventually the stop work order was pulled down and we started seeing the guys coming back to work on the house. I asked the contractor if they'd gotten their permits straightened out and he said that they had, and I told him about the water leaking into our house and he said he would fix it and pay for the damages (I have almost all of our communications documented in text messages).

&amp;#x200B;

It was September, our son was three months old at the time, so we got the mold removed as quickly as possible. [It turns out that while demolishing their addition, this guy had knocked out a portion of the masonry wall supporting \*our\* addition](https://imgur.com/a/UA7AABY), and that the demolition left the top of the masonry wall completely exposed, letting water in all along the wall. Then, during an inspection afterwards, it was discovered that the moisture in the wall had caused an infestation of termites that needed to be exterminated, but the leak was still active, so nothing could be done about it yet. What followed was four months of this guy trying different tactics to fix the leak, each less successful than the last. 

&amp;#x200B;

Once the bill came due for the mold removal ($1760) the contractor had me send him the information so he could send a check, and then proceeded to repeatedly lie to me about sending payment for around two months. The mold removal company was very patient in dealing with this situation, but eventually the contractor started arguing about how much the service cost and refusing to pay, leaving us responsible for the bill. Due to the weather and this guy's inability to fix the leak for four months, we haven't been able to deal with the termites or the damaged studs, drywall, and insulation, but I'm certain this guy's going to try and stiff us on that, too.

&amp;#x200B;

It doesn't seem as though this guy is licensed or insured, so we asked for and received contact information for the homeowner, hoping that we could just file a claim through her homeowner's insurance and deal with it that way. She initially seemed receptive to this plan, but in the last month has avoided us like the plague. She hasn't returned any of our calls or texts, and the contractor has been no help in getting any of this information. We know that the owner is in legal trouble with the city for tax evasion, and that violation of a stop work order carries very hefty fines (for which there's apparently a court case pending), but the only information out there about this person lists the house next door as her permanent address.

&amp;#x200B;

We'd like to file a suit the homeowner or contractor in small claims court for the cost of the repairs, but don't know how to find either of them. All we have are phone numbers and a license plate for the contractor. We've talked very briefly with a lawyer about the situation, but were told that the amount we'd be suing for wouldn't warrant paying for representation. Any advice on how to bring this mind numbing, soul sucking journey to an end would be greatly appreciated!

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: an unlicensed contractor did something on the order of $5-7k in damage to our home, said he would pay for repairs and hasn't, and the homeowner won't pay or give us her homeowner's insurance information to work out payment. We have scant information but would like to file a suit against either or both of them but aren't sure how to proceed.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/atin99/unpermitted_contractor_next_door_did_5000_of/,legaladvice,1052,70,0.0
Ksilverstar25,2019-02-22 01:04:33+00:00,Bank gave away my entire banking account,"So last week, a check I wrote bounced from an account I have that I rarely use. It's a beneficiary account from when my grandfather died. I called the bank where I was informed that I closed the account to pay for ""my wedding"". I told them I sure as hell did not and have been married for 6 years. After them jerking me around ""are you sure you're not getting married"" ""did you maybe forget about taking that money for your wedding""...etc. I finally got them to open a fraud case. 

Here's the crazy part. I call and basically stalk them to get them to investigate. I finally speak with someone and what happened is they gave my money away to another woman with the same name. This woman opened a car loan with the bank and because we have the same name they just hooked her name to my account. She lives in Florida and I live in colorado. We do not have anything else in common but our 1st and last name. So she ends up calling the bank they ""assure her"" that money is hers and a relative left it to her so she rushes down and withdraws it all. I figured all this out before the bank did through some good old fashioned Facebook and internet stalking sent them the info, boom. Open and shut case.

So now, the bank has admitted fault (finally) and will restore the account. They asked me not to file a police report, which sort of makes sense (they after all encouraged her to take it) but I have no idea what personal info of mine she has, and was given to her. The icing on the cake was I got a letter from the bank yesterday with her personal info on it, including address, so now they've compromised both our info.

Do I have any legal recourse? Do I just shut up and hope she doesnt steal my identity and be glad they're giving my money back? What advice do you have?",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/atb2ce/bank_gave_away_my_entire_banking_account/,legaladvice,14263,132,0.0
anon_pregnant,2019-02-21 15:45:24+00:00,Got terminated after telling boss I’m pregnant,"  

I’ve been working at this company for a year and a half and have had no negative feedback or commentary about my work. I had about 3 major projects and 2 smaller projects going on as of November 2018. Around December, stating there’s not enough work for everyone, my boss took one of my major projects and one of my smaller projects and gave them to other team members in similar positions as me. I was OK with this, as I figured if others don’t have workload it is OK to distribute it evenly. As of yesterday, I still had one major project closing out (deficiency work in progress), one major project active until at least June, and one smaller project until at least March. I was busy.

&amp;#x200B;

In the middle of January, I found out I was pregnant. I’ve been dealing with strong bouts of morning sickness and decided to tell my boss on Feb 8th that I am pregnant via a formal letter and email - after my first ultrasound &amp; prenatal confirmation (Feb 6th and 7th respectively - I was about 8 weeks). 

After having very little communication with me during this period, he decided to terminate my employment yesterday, 12 days after finding out I’m pregnant. The reason he stated is that “there is not enough work” and business “economical decisions”. However, none of the other team members in similar positions have been given reduced work, hours, or terminations. I am the only one affected. 

I was also not offered any other opportunity for reduced work hours, work loads, or even an opportunity for early mat leave which I would've definitely considered if it meant maintaining somewhat steady employment during this time. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am currently taking anti-nausea medication (that I have to remain on for the duration of pregnancy) and pregnancy-triggered asthma medication along with having some gum/teeth bleeding issues that are also symptoms from pregnancy. I had booked a dental appointment on March 9th for this issue. After this termination I’ve lost my health insurance (husband is self-employed and was on my insurance). I’ve been only given one week of insurance coverage which does not even cover the end of the month.

&amp;#x200B;

I am wondering what my legal rights are in this situation.

&amp;#x200B;

P.S. I haven’t taken any time away from work due to my symptoms. We have the opportunity to work remotely from site or home if need be and I have followed through every single day, even if I was bedridden, with all of my work emails and tasks for the day. I have informed my manager of every appointment (there were only 3) and taken time off either during lunch breaks or scheduled it accordingly to not affect my work schedule.

despicabledad,2019-02-21 02:45:03+00:00,"[MO] My wealthy dad died, leaving everything to my older sister - my mom is now destitute.","This situation is complicated, so please excuse the vague title. Also a few minor details have been fudged to provide some anonymity. TLDR at the bottom.

My dad had a marriage before the one to my mother. It was only for a couple of years, but they had one child, my older sister (OS). My mom was her babysitter, and ended up marrying my dad when OS was 5. I was born 9 years later, and then my younger sister (YS) was born two years after that.

After YS was born, my mom decided she didn't give 2 shits about OS, and that OS was “taking resources” from YS and I. I’m not trying to defend her, just give context. She basically prevented our dad from paying for OS to go to college, or helping OS financially in any way, along with pretty badly abusing OS while Dad was away on business trips.

OS is now in her late 30s, I’m in my late 20s, and YS is in her mid 20s. Our dad passed away of heart failure a few weeks ago, and all hell has broken loose.

Apparently, some time ago my dad convinced my mom to divorce him for “tax reasons” (my mom is not good with money) and was paying her a chunk of change in alimony every month while they still lived together. So the will has nothing for her except one small house he owned in the middle of nowhere. YS and I are both given trust funds that pay out a monthly stipend and can be used for certain expenses (weddings, medical bills, grad school, etc). Everything else - the business, the money, all the other houses - everything, was left to OS.

This doesn't really bug me as I wasn't interested in taking up the “family business” and have a decent career on my own, but my mother apparently doesn't have a savings or retirement fund of any kind, and hasn't worked since she babysat OS ages ago. She didn't finish high school, she dropped out to marry my dad when she turned 18. 

I tried approaching OS to talk to her about giving something to my mom so she doesn't have to work, but she is pretty firm on making sure that my mom gets nothing. I tried going from the angle that our dad was kind of a predator (he was never faithful to my mom either) and my mom didn't know any better, but OS is of the opinion that being destitute is her “just desserts” for the crap my mom put her through.

I tried to see if maybe mom could contest the will on the grounds of them having a common law marriage (as no one knew they were divorced except them as far as I know), but MO apparently did away with Common Law Marriage in the 1920s. 

OS is the executor of the estate, and it’s in probate right now (i think that’s the right terminology, sorry, I’m not a lawyer), but I gave a copy of the will to my friend’s dad who is and he said he’d take a look over the weekend.

My Questions: 1) Can the trust I was given be used to help my mother instead of me? 2) Is there some kind of loophole where we can still get some money from OS to make sure mom doesn't have to work (I know she probably \*should\* get a job, but she has no experience and is over 50)? 3) If we can’t get money from OS/The Estate/My Trust, am I required to provide my mother with care if she refuses to get a job? I’m hoping to get some answers to these as a sort of “second opinion” alongside friend’s dad’s opinion so I know if I need to be setting aside money for an attorney to fight hard for my mom or just kind of distance myself.

TLDR: My dad was a serial cheater and my mom was admittedly abusive to my OS (more than I’ve mentioned here). Mom and Dad weren't married when dad died, OS got basically everything.

extraacount183,2019-02-20 16:40:26+00:00,My roommate stole and hid my antidepressants from me.,"So I am a college student living in a dorm with two roommates, one who I get along with very well and the other who hates my guts for various reasons- she believes I’m trying to steal her boyfriend even though I’m in a relationship of my own and have no interest in her bf, she thinks I eat her food (I don’t), she’s just a very bizarre and rude person who has decided she hates me for no real reason. 

I recently attempted suicide during a mental breakdown and I was admitted to a psychiatric hospital for a week. I came home, didn’t tell her where I had been and everything just resumed as normal. The hospital prescribed me Zoloft once a day that I’ve been on for about a month now. If I forget to take my pill, I feel extremely disoriented and tired, I get horrible headaches, my anxiety goes through the roof, I have panic attacks, I get nauseous, it ruins my entire day. 

My pills went missing this past weekend. I keep them on the bathroom counter next to my toothbrush so I remember to take them first thing in the morning. I couldn’t find them ANYWHERE, I ripped apart my side of the room looking for them and they were just gone. I then ripped apart the bathroom looking for them, and finally found them in the bottom my roommates bathroom bag that she keeps under the sink, wrapped in a headband. 

I was livid and when she came home I confronted her about it and asked her why the hell my pills were in her bag and hidden in a headband. She got mad at me for looking in her bag and tried to spin it all on me. I told her she couldn’t get mad at me for looking through her stuff when my medicine was hidden in her bag, and she told me that “since I steal her food all the time, she wanted me to know what it’s like to have your stuff go missing.” I was dumbfounded and I just grabbed my pills and told her I was going to look into legal action and not to touch my medicine ever again. 

I’ve been keeping my medicine on my person ever since, and I’m wondering what I can legally do in response to her taking my medicine. What are my options? I’m 19 and I live in the USA, Michigan to be exact. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/asqgg0/my_roommate_stole_and_hid_my_antidepressants_from/,legaladvice,8841,79,0.0

I work in at a small office.  We have a community fridge.  Around a month ago, someone started to steal people's food.  An apple here, a power bar there, no biggie.  Over time, the thief became more brazen.  I came in once and saw my sandwich with a large bite taken and then discarded in the trash.  So I decided to do something, and now I may be in trouble.  I began to write **POISON, DO NOT EAT** on the outside of my brown paper bag lunch, with a black sharpie.  I did this for a few days and food was stolen again.  
Last week, I made my lunch as normal, loaded the browie with laxative.  I then wrapped the brownie in paper.  On the paper I wrote the following:  **POISON, DO NOT EAT**.   I put it in the bag, which also had the same written warning applied.  In big, clear, black sharpie, it said, ""**POISON, DO NOT EAT**""  I left it in the fridge as normal went went about my day.  Sure enough, about four hours later the EMS had arrived.  A coworker found the brownie and took the bait, and was being taken to the ER.

freerunlady92,2019-02-20 00:45:48+00:00,"UPDATE Neighbors off leash dog attacks and injures my dog, sister, and myself. Now she's trying to sue me. We're the ones with 29k in medical bills. NC USA","Here's a link to the original post. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/aoovyg/neighbors_off_leash_dog_attacks_and_injures_my/?st=JSCE6BW3&amp;sh=7f56780f


My sister and I spent the weekend after I posted researching local lawyers that were suggested by our insurance and found 3 we wanted to contact. 
The guy we went with is amazing and more vicious then the neighbors dog. 
He is also willing to take payment after a judgment or settlement and offered us a lower percentage then from what we have researched is the norm. 

Ends up his son had been attacked by an off leash dog once and he ""feels very strongly that irresponsible dog owners understand the repercussions of their actions and that the neighbor is a threat and this needs to be handled quickly.""

The neighbors mean dog has been put down.  She was deemed uncontrollable and not able to be rehabbed. 

We've seen the nice dog over the last few days with the roommate so she must have paid the fines to get her back. 

Our lawyer responded to her case against me and confirmed we'd be meeting them in small claims court.  

She was also served with 2 separate lawsuits. 
One from myself with my medical cost including estimated long term cost, rehab cost, lost work/vacation days, pain and suffering, and destruction of property.  I'll explain the destruction of property shortly. 

One for my sister including estimated long term medical cost, lost work/vacation days, property damage (our dog), and pain and suffering. 

Her lawsuit against me has a court date of March 5th.  After she was served with our lawsuits, she apparently desperately tried dropping the case against me but the prosecutor denied her request (didn't know they could do that).   She then tried contacting our lawyer multiple times to ask him to get the prosecutor to drop the case, he informed her that wasn't something he had control of and we'd still be moving forward with the 2 lawsuits against her. 

She finally got herself a lawyer and our lawyer was contacted with settlement offers that in his term were, ""laughable"" and we refused the settlement offers. 

Our lawyer used past cases of dog attacks in NC where settlements of over 800k were paid out and that involved cases where the dogs owners actually tried to stop the attack.

Now for some extra facts. 

My left wrist is going to need surgery that's scheduled to take place on February 27th. 

Our dog had the drain removed from her neck and her skin graft is healing up nicely but she's still in a cast with pins in her paw.  The vet thinks she'll have a limp but will recover with no other long lasting injuries.  She still refuses to go out the back door anymore and will cry and plant if we try. 

The destruction of property in my claim comes from those cameras my boyfriend installed.  

The day after her dog was put down, she literally took a baseball bat to everything in our front and back yard.  She broke our porch railing, smashed all our flower pots, bent my hammocks metal base and used some kind of utility knife to slice up the hammock, tore the plants out of the ground in our garden (including pulling up imported maple trees), dumped some sort of substance that had a jelly like consistency into our koi pond killing all the fish, and broke various other things in our yard.  She straight up went on a rampage that was all caught on the cameras.  She also left 2 notes on our door, one threatened to shoot our dogs and that she'd have someone beat us up.  

We called the cops immediately and they took it seriously. They asked if we wanted to press charges and we did. 

Our lawyer used the notes and camera footage to get an emergency protection order for us and we haven't so much as seen her since, though we see her car come and go. 

The video of the attack that the other neighbors son took was a pure godsend.  It shows how she just sat there and did nothing to try and stop the attack. It also shows her audibly laughing during it. She only started trying to help when I started smashing her dog into the ground. 

We also got statements from multiple neighbors and our lawyer is working on getting the multiple complaints from other families from the HOA. 

He said it's pointless to go after the HOA and we wouldn't get worth while results from them.  Our lawyer did tell us that the HOA has started the eviction process against the neighbors but that could take a long time and can be contested. 

There was also a memo sent out to the neighborhood about leash rules and that there will be an upcoming vote about possibly muzzling dogs if they're in common areas outside of our private properties and other new neighborhood rules concerning pets. 

I honestly can't tell if this lady had some sort of mental breakdown or is just plain crazy. 

Either way, my sister and I both have our separate court dates against her in mid and end of March.  

I'm trying not to plan on anything until it's all said and done but if I get even half of what my lawyer is suing her for, I'd be able to realize a life long dream of going to college!  Nothing too crazy but I've desperately wanted to go to school and that may actually be a possibility.  

Thank you all so much for your advice and guidance. You guys not only gave us the knowledge but the confidence to fight this and were both so grateful to you all. 

I'll be sure to update after the court dates and keep you guys up to date.  Please feel free to ask any questions and I'll answer whatever I can.

redneck_lezbo,2019-02-19 03:20:55+00:00,AZ/NV just found out my wife was married as a ‘joke’ in Vegas in 1997,"I never thought I’d be posting here but I need some help on where to go from here. My wife and I are about to celebrate our 15th anniversary in a few weeks. Long ago when we first got together she told me she married one of her gay guy co-workers in Vegas as a joke when she was a teen. Honestly, I thought she was full of it and that it probably wasn’t anything legal anyway. 

Well, now I read another post on LA about a guy who might have gotten married to a stranger in Vegas. Someone on his post added a link to the Clark County marriage record search. I put her name in and holy shit if a certificate didn’t pop up. She is sitting next to me ready to puke. She didn’t think it was a legal marriage either.

So now what?  She didn’t even really know the guy. Has no idea what happened to him. She is frantically searching Google and Facebook for him with no luck. 

So I guess our marriage is invalid?  We have two kids!  What does this mean. Were they adopted fraudulently because our marriage certificate is invalid?  I will get an attorney tomorrow but would like to know what to expect. 

1. What if we can’t find this guy?
2. What if we do?
3. How much shit are we in for: filing taxes together, getting our names changed, adopting our kids under the pretense that we were married?
4. Best case scenario- quickie paper divorce, right?  And then what, do we have to get remarried?

To clarify: we live in AZ, marriage happened in 1997 in NV

cscthrowaway0,2019-02-16 11:20:11+00:00,Michigan. I was denied a restraining order because my abuser said I'm kinky and because of my sexual history.,"In October, in the process of getting out of an abusive relationship, I filed for a restraining order and filed a police report and gave evidence such as text messages in which my abuser admitted to doing it. I gave the same copies of texts to the police when I filed the police report.

At the protective order hearing, his defense was that it was consensual because I have a sexual history involving BDSM, and that I was simply trying to ""punish"" him. We did not have that kind of sexual relationship, and hearing the judge asking him questions about my sexual history was extremely upsetting. They were laughing and joking about how ""you'd think it would be the other way around"" that I was a more experienced submissive than my ex was an experienced Dominant. I brought a eyewitness but the judge did not want to hear from my witness at all. He said it sounded like a ""bad breakup"" and gave me a restraining order for a few weeks as a ""cooling off period.""

Today I found out that the prosecutor is charging him. I know that there is a higher burden of proof for criminal charges than there is for a restraining order, so surely I should have been granted an actual restraining order, right? I want to know if I have any recourse for how the judge acted during the restraining order hearing, because it definitely put me in danger, and I worry that others will be put in danger too. I don't care about trying to get money, I just really feel like this is not the series of events that should have occurred. Is there anything I can do?

A few months into the lease my boyfriend from out of state came and stayed with me for about 10 days.  About a month later my landlord started the eviction process because I broke the lease.  See, my lease clearly states no guest may stay with me at the house for longer then 4 days in a row and no more then 8 days in any 30 day period.  So, the landlord is correct, I broke the lease.  

&amp;#x200B;

Our court date is next week, and I'm fighting the eviction because that seems like a bad clause and I like the place.  I figured he just sort of was being over protective of his house and was checking up frequently and noticed my bfs car or something, well it turns out that wasn't it.  See he e-mailed me today with a settlement offer.  If I moved out by Sunday he would withdraw the eviction, it won't show up on my records, and he'll wave all fees.  He said he could prove that I broke the lease and sent 10 photos, one for each day that my boyfriend was here.  Well, the photos are from inside the house.  I'm not 100% sure where the camera is, but based on what I can see in the pictures, it must be in or near the ceiling fan.  

&amp;#x200B;

So, I'm pretty sure what I did was (probably) not so bad.  Though I'm very sure what he did is definitely illegal.  Now, my bf wants me to call the cops and have him arrested.  To be clear, I do too.  But I know he's planning on submitting those photo as evidence against me in court next week.  I want to let him, and then call the cops.  Is that a stupid plan?

NotACriminal18,2018-09-27 13:27:00+00:00,Worlds fastest update - refused DNA test (CA),"While I was getting my ass handed to me in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9is8jh/refused_dna_test_california/), a coworker confessed to the assault. From what I hear, the dna tests were just a threat to put pressure on this one dude who they suspected, I don’t think they actually took anyone’s dna.


Many people pointed out that I sounded sketchy in my original post. That was probably true. I’m a recovering addict (three years clean and sober), and I did a lot of crazy stuff in my past- not raping anyone, but junkie shit like breaking and entering, squatting, getting in fights, etc. I didn’t know you could get a paternity test for an unborn baby, so I thought they were just going to put my dna in a database, and maybe things I never got caught for would come up. If I knew I was just being tested against a baby, I would have said sure.


I want to say that *because* of my past, I’m a squeaky clean employee- I never so much as swipe a snack from the pantry or an Advil from the med cart. We’re not supposed to ever be alone with members, and I never am, even if I’m just dropping off a tray in someone’s room, or if a member has work detail in the kitchen.

Pettheftthrow,2018-09-25 22:38:44+00:00,LA was right...it was a cat scam (update to pet theft accusations) PA,"Recap. Years ago I took in an injured kitten. Earlier this year I was connected on social media by someone claiming to be the original owner. They demanded return of the kitty and I ignored them. They then escalated to sending letters to my home.

Some LA posters thought it might have been a scam. I was sceptical because they hadn't asked for money even after things had dragged on for a while. Well, I guess they were playing the long con because I just got my first letter suggesting a few hundred dollars might just assist the ""owner"" to move on from their loss.  As a bonus, it was sent on letterhead from a nonexistent lawyer's office. If I don't pay the cat fee they plan to sue. My favorite part is that they don't specify for what, exactly. They're just going to sue.  You know, like lawyers do.

 I'm still kinda worried they might try to steal kitty and demand a ransom (kitty is indoor only, chipped, and rarely left alone...on days I do have to work in office I've been taking him in with me.) But yeah, I'm thinking this is one of the weirder catfishing schemes on record. 

I tried to tell kitty about his custody dispute, but he just yawned in my face and joined his big brothers for a celebratory afternoon nap. Though he did hack up a hairball on my pillow yesterday...paying someone else to take him is starting to look pretty tempting.

MountMyBlade,2018-09-24 21:02:09+00:00,Wife and I had IVF done recently. Possible HIPAA Violation?,"A few months ago, my wife and I recently went through IVF. The fertility clinic makes it part of their process to test all patients for gonorrhea/chlamydia. No big deal, I guess.  Our real issue is that the lab company sent the bill to my wife's workplace. It was addressed to her, but her workplace opened the bill. This was really embarrassing for my wife, because the HR lady saw the bill; it only showed a line item for  ""Chlamydia/GC Amplification"". In an attempt to save face, she had to explain our infertility issues which is hard for her to do. 

After making some phone calls, it appears that the fertility clinic filled the forms out correctly and the Lab company sent the bill to the wrong address. When I called them, they apologized and said they'd look into it. They followed up with us by sending a copy of the form the clinic sent in (which was filled out correctly). They claimed it was the clinic's fault, but the formed showed otherwise.   


We were upset with this, but decided to just move on. That was all a few months ago.   


Well, today, we received the other bill (I guess one for each of us. I don't know why this one took so long). This was, again, sent to my wife's workplace and again opened. Is this a HIPAA violation?

HelpfulButterscotch2,2018-09-24 12:22:12+00:00,[CA] A student at the preschool I work at is only being taught a fictional language,"I'm twenty, and I work part-time as an assistant at a small daycare in California.

There is a four year old who speaks very very little and poor English. Knows the most basic of words but is at the level of maybe a two year old English-wise compared to the other kids, including several who are both native Spanish/English speakers. Basically knows ""yes"", ""no"", ""juice"", etc. He's only been here for less than a month and I've seen his incredibly limited vocab double in that time. I'm embarrassed to say it but I'm very uneducated about this type of thing and I thought he was speaking Portuguese or something similar up until last week. The kids are split into small groups by age and I'm usually not in charge of his group unless it's at the end of the day, in my defense.

The hosts of the daycare are very into nerd culture and some of the daycare is very decorated with (child friendly) sci-fi and fantasy stuff. I'm not too into it myself but I like listening to them and I (usually) like their passion.

One day I was curious what language the child was speaking so I looked up what Portuguese actually sounded like and realized it wasn't that. Looked up a lot of languages and for the life of me could not identify it. The single dad who picked him up looked like a nice dude and one day he was one of the last people to pick up that day so I asked him what language his kid spoke. The bosses of the daycare were there too when I asked and they all suddenly got big smiles on their faces and explained to me in depth that the guy was a linguistics hobbyist who was trying to recreate an experiment where he raises his kid to speak a language from the tv show Star Trek (klingon.)

He explained how at home he only has spoken Klingon (which is apparently a real full language) to the kid and that's all he knows. My bosses LOVE that he is doing this and he does too, he told me to look up the experiment and read about it. My bosses even learned a small bit of the language themselves so that when they talk to the kid they don't say it. 

It sounded kinda cool at the time but I didn't really think about it too much. When I looked it up I found out that the guy who did it taught his kid Klingon AND English at the same time. I assumed that this guy was doing the same and I just misunderstood but when I clarified next time he confirmed that the kid was ONLY being taught Klingon on purpose and he was going to try and continue the ""experiment"" for as long as possible. He also told me about his blog and I checked it out where he describes this all and he basically states in it that he is fully aware that this will make it ""slightly"" hard for the kid to speak english later but that the experience is worth it. He even has limited the kids intake of media very severely so far to avoid shows with a lot of speaking/words.

The kid is fairly isolated and generally acts a bit socially ""off"", if I can say that without being mean. Not like misbehaving but he clearly has small issues interacting with kids his age who all talk a lot already.

I've brought it up casually with my bosses but they basically love this dude and what he is doing and don't see a problem with it. I feel terrible but I feel like I should report this? Is this child abuse? This guy basically is mispurposely not teaching his kid to how to interact with other people for the level of ""it's just a social experiment bro"", it's nuts to me.

If I'm wrong and this isn't dangerous I apologize. It feels awful to me though. I like my job otherwise but if I had to lose it for this i could find another one, have some savings, i feel too bad for this kid.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9ihg6s/ca_a_student_at_the_preschool_i_work_at_is_only/,legaladvice,4909,43,4.0
goingcrazyoverhere64,2018-09-23 12:35:03+00:00,(US) ex seeking full custody of the kids for the 4th time. Feels like I'm going crazy.,"I posted this in r/divorce before. Adding updates as to what has unfolded. 

Throw away account because he stalks every thing I do. Just to be safe.

Two years ago I (now 29F) was out of the blue handed separation papers from my husband (now 30m)... this led to one of the worst times of my life. I found out he was having an affair. Was taking our 3 children to her house and telling them not to tell me or they'd get in trouble. His behavior toward me changed dramatically. He became extremely abusive and the police were called to our home. (He was forcing me to move out but at the time I had nowhere to go, I had no money on my own.) Two long days later he's charged with a domestic violence charge, and I get granted a temporary protective order. We get to court, judge drops it because he's calm in court but warns him if he even touches me he will go to jail. Eventually he pleads guilty to his charge and gets a year probation. We go to court again. He wants full custody. Drags me through the mud. Judge said no way and gave us a 50/50 split. He's still with the woman he has an affair with. I ask for 6 months of no paramours around the children because he wanted to move her in immediately and I believed the kids needed some healing time. Judge agrees and adds it. He's livid. In the 6 month period he gets her pregnant. We go back to court again after the 6 months.  He again asks for full custody. Judge denies and keeps it at 50/50 because it's working for the kids. The other woman however we find out after court had moved in about a month before the 6 month period had ended. He told the kids, again, to lie to me or they'd be in trouble. Some time passes, I meet an amazing man. We were good friends first, then decided to try dating. Dating is perfect. I introduce him to the kids. The kids adore him, he adores the kids. It's going nearly perfect. Except my ex is flipping out because how dare I move on. How dare I involve him with the kids. I don't deserve to move on he claims. More time passes. We move in together. Kids have their own rooms. They love it here! My divorce finally becomes final. Ex gets married the very next day after we are granted the divorce. The next day after that he files a show cause because I moved in with boyfriend. He wants full custody again. My youngest then tells my mother that some strange things have been going on with daddy and she doesn't think it's right. Daddy tells her not to trust mommy's boyfriend because he's going to hurt them and touch them in the no no places. This goes on. More and more of these comments are revealed that my ex is telling them my boyfriend is going to hurt them. We go for our pre-trial for the show cause, it's granted to move forward. Date is set. Not a week later I get a call from cps that they need to investigate an allegation that my boyfriend touched my oldest. We do the interview, cps clears him completely. It's obvious he hasn't done anything because he's never left alone with the kids. I'm in charge of baths, etc. However, the cps worker thinks she has been abused, but she was coached to say it was my boyfriend. They seem to think it was my ex or my ex's father or my ex knows it's his father and he's covering it up. So now they are investigating his family instead. We are waiting for the results and What is uncovered. 

Im shaking all the time. I haven't slept right in days. I can barely eat. My baby was hurt. I knew it in my gut. It was attempted to be pegged on my boyfriend but they found no way for the allegation to be possible. 

It's all a mess. This is beyond who deserves custody. This is who hurt my daughter. How can I get justice for my daughter and help her heal from this .. 

Update: my boyfriend has been 100% cleared of any allegations. It was ruled unfounded, as we expected. However, the ex has decided to ignore our custody agreement and only give two of our three kids to me. We did week on week off. When I went to get them at our usual meetinf spot a month and a half ago, I was met by an off duty police officer that was a friend of his family letting me know I would only be getting two of the children as the oldest is now ""terrified of her mother and the mother's boyfriend."" I attempted to call another police officer but they said it was a civil matter. I filed a show cause for him violating the custodial agreement. Tomorrow is our court date. I have not seen my oldest child in over a month, have not been allowed to talk to her, or my questions about how she is doing are ignored. Ex just won't talk to me at all. 

My attorney says this is an obvious and clear cut case of parental alienation and it's obvious he wasn't getting his way so he escalated his claims to attempt to get custody. 

Obviously, I don't think this is going to be a cake walk. However, I just want to know I'm not crazy and this is actually an attempt at parental alienation and I'm not going to lose my children to a monster who is an expert of maniuplation.

It was only 20 hours of unskilled work and he’s a strong guy, so I agreed to hire him and pay cash at the end of the week ($25 per hour or $500).

Otto did a great job for two days. Planters moved and placed, stones for retaining wall loaded up, the big rotten wood pile dismantled, and so on. 

At the end of the second day, and with only six hours of work left to do, Otto got either drunk or high and phoned his girlfriend to rage violent threats at her. He then broke into her apartment, wrecked most of her furniture, and stole her ATM card and her savings. There’s no doubt of his guilt; security cameras and ATM tracks told the tale.

He is in jail on a long list of charges.

I owe this guy for fourteen hours of work, or $350 cash. This just happened two days ago. I would rather kiss a pig than have contact with him again. He hasn’t phoned me; hopefully he used his one phone call for a lawyer.

promisesdashed,2018-09-22 05:20:57+00:00,A TV talk show “surprised” me with free surgery/services after I shared my cancer story on their show. They haven’t delivered on any of their promises.,"A year ago, I appeared on a national TV show. Due to a rare, aggressive cancer, I've had to have numerous surgeries that have been disfiguring and resulted in constant discomfort. 

For a little context and maybe to help underscore my disappointment, it might be helpful to add that I am young, have almost no family, and cannot work. I can't afford the surgeries I need, so I was really excited to be on the show.

I had a flight paid for and was put up in a hotel, but had to pay for all travel Ubers, including to/from the studio.

My journey and photos were documented on the episode. At the conclusion of my segment, the hosts had three surprises for me. I don’t want to quote the show/risk not being anonymous, but in the aired episode, it is explicit that these are all offered free of charge.

1. FREE RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY - it was outlined on the show just what I needed

2. FREE SPECIALIST TREATMENT

3. A SERIES OF FREE COUNSELING SESSIONS 

In the year following the show, I have received only ONE thing:

The show booked me a flight to/from Las Vegas to meet with a specialist. Knowing I have significant upper respiratory problems, they booked me a room in a smoking casino hotel. When I expressed concern about this, I was told to ""try not to breathe in the smoke.""  I had to pay for all my expenses, including my Uber to/from the airport and to/from the office (45 mins each way), which put my bank account in the negative for two months. The show made me wait 16 hours at the airport because my flight out was delayed and they didn't want to put me up in a hotel for another night. I had to go to the hospital as soon as I got home, because I had already developed infections. The specialist’s office has been non-responsive since. 

I have not received anything further. No surgery, no treatments, no counseling. I have emailed the show's coordinator multiple times, and each time am told to sit tight, but nothing happens. 

I'm not sure if I have a case here. If I have legal options, what kind of lawyer would I consult, and would they charge me upfront?

I went to college for computer engineering, and got a job in the industry afterwards. In college, my internships, and my job, I've dealt with sexual harassment and I've had to get tough with people, telling them to stay the fuck away when I get the first whiff of sketchiness.

Every time I've gotten a creepy text or instant message from another student or co worker, I've screenshotted it and backed it up in google drive just in case it escalates. That's helped me a few times, when someone started to follow me around in college, and when someone took things so far at work that I decided to go to HR. I don't report most of the shit though, I don't want it to look bad like I'm always running to HR.

Last night, I got really drunk with my friend because I had a day off planned for today. I went home in a kinda bad mood because we'd been talking about how she was going through similar shit at work. I was in a ""fuck it all"" mood, and I uploaded my whole folder of screenshotted text messages to Facebook and Instagram, with the caption ""Phone &amp; Inbox of a female computer engineer."" And tagged all the men who had sent me messages, whose social media I could find.

Some of the highlights were...

A bunch of married men hitting on me, and me replying ""dude you're married"" or something along those lines.

Some guys asking me out and then taking rejection badly.

Some guys who would text me repeatedly even though I'd just replied ""Don't contact me, other than for work purposes""

Sexually explicit messages, or messages commenting on my appearance out of the blue.

Overall, just messages from people ignoring my wishes to be left alone.

This morning, I woke up to my phone blowing up. (I had planned to take a vacation day off work today). A lot of the guys I'd tagged in my social media posts had contacted me demanding or pleading that I remove the posts. Most everyone had untagged themselves.

The Facebook post had gotten some attention from my friends, but my two Instagram posts (I had to make 2 to fit all the photos) had blown up. I had a lot of new followers, a lot of strangers commenting on my post, mostly supportive.

I also had a email from HR at work asking me to meet with them first thing Monday morning. I replied to say that I would. I don't know what to expect there at all. I have not replied to any other messages about my posts.

I need some advice. Should I speak to the guys who texted me about the posts? Some are very angry with me because they are married and their wives found out. I'm thinking it's safest to not. Should I leave the posts up, or remove them? Or wait to see how things go with HR before I decide? Should I be worried for my safety? I feel a little nervous but I don't know if I'm overreacting.

My sister is overweight, weighing in at nearly 400 pounds. It is a very embarrassing thing for her, and it's always been a struggle to help her shed weight. Her endo has diagnosed her with severe thyroid problems along with hormonal imbalances that have been difficult to treat even with various medications. So a part of her current weight loss regiment is to exercise at a gym as recommended by her GP and her endocrinologist. She has enrolled at (x) Gym a few weeks ago.

Right away, she has claimed that she has had run-ins with a group of catty women. My sister has depression and anxiety, formed partly due to intense bullying from classmates and co-workers as well as abuse from our parents. So she tends to get overly nervous and makes mistakes. So my sister began to misuse the equipment accidentally, and the women tear into her in a very mean way. My sister apologizes but these women report her to the gym who reprimand my sister.

So for many days, my sister was being belittled and insulted by this group. They continued to report her and make her feel bad. Still she tried to ignore it because her health depended on this. One day, my sister got filmed struggling with the equipment and she slipped on the mat, falling on her butt. This was posted online and got passed around the gym and outside of it. She found out way later, and this hurt her. When she reported this to the gym, the manager said he would speak to the women. Days later, she asked the manager if he spoke to them, and he asked who my sister was (basically he forgot).

My sister wrote a complaint to the higher ups at the gym. She received a response stating that there was nothing they could do about her being filmed, as it was a public space. Three days after this, she received a notice stating her membership at the gym was cancelled. Despite this, she was charged the renewal fee. I stepped in and called them, demanding a refund on my sister's behalf. The gym told me that it was her responsibility to cancel the membership herself, I told them that *they* were the ones who cancelled on her. Basically the conversation went in circles.

Now what can I do? I have a feeling that there's not much I can do legally but I am hoping something can be done. My sister does not want to go to the media because she feels embarrassed and is afraid of being in front of a camera, also of the video online gaining more visibility. Can I take them to court? If so, for what charges?

Parents are threatening to sue.","On Monday afternoon my 2rd grade child's desk mate (basically 2 students side by side, and 2 facing the other people), started breaking out into a rash of hives. Emergency services were called and the child did not need the use of an Epipen, however he was apparently hospitalized (this is what i have been told). 

Unfortunately this child has an extremely severe egg, and soy allergy. A week before school started we were notified about this, and told that my son and 2 other children would be his desk mates, and we were given detailed instructions about this child's allergies. 

However we were told that he would not be eating lunch with them, and during lunch all desks would be wiped clean however it implored us to try and minimize any use of soy and egg in any of our lunches. Which i have done to the absolute best of my ability.

Unbeknownst to me last week that changed (parents complained not fair for their child to be alone for lunch), so he joined his other 3 deskmates for lunch. My son never mentioned this, nor were we informed about this. Unfortunately after lunch he had an allergic reaction. 

Today i had a one on one with the schools principal and someone from the schools district, apparently the affected child has claimed that he saw my son eating a small kit kat bar during class, not long before he had his allergic reaction. My son denies it, and frankly i believe him (mostly because he isn't a fan of chocolate), and i am stumped as to where he would get an item like that (i haven't bought halloween candy yet). 

The school hasn't made a decision as to what they are going to do, but apparently the other family wants my child removed from the class. Also i received a long and very angry facebook message from the mother, who basically said she is planning to consult with legal, because ""my child tried to murder hers"". 

I have talked to my son and he denies everything.

My questions are:

I’ve documented it since the beginning of the month but I’m beginning to wonder if it’s even worth addressing since I’m a (large, black) male and they’re all white women (Missouri)","Here’s the copy&amp;paste of the documentations I’ve made in my phone since September 1 and all the names have been changed to fake ones; times are approximate:

September 1, 2018 at 16:00- Sam sends me 5 pictures of her posing in her bathing suit (I still have those messages on my phone)

September 2nd, 2018 at 13:20- Christie hugs me from behind at the customer service desk and brushes her hands over my crotch in front of customers. 

September 2nd, 2018 at 19:10- Christie smacks my butt while I’m bending over to pick up a box that she specifically called me and asked me to come move.

September 2nd, 2018 at 23:00- Christie blocks me from walking out of the store until I give her a hug. She buries her face in my neck and sniffs me and tells me I smell really good.

September 3rd, 2018 at 14:00- Christie and Sam sit in the break room with me while I’m on a lunch break and talk to me about their past sexual experiences and ask me about mine and the size of my penis

September 4, 2018 at 21:00- Ashley comes up behind me while I’m tying to write a contract for a customer who’s waiting at the customer service desk and starts rubbing the back of my neck. I pull forward to get away and she keeps rubbing. I repeat, “can you not?” Multiple times until she stops. Shannon was there and witnessed all of this. 

September 8, 2018 at 09:00- Sam walks up behind me and grabs my arm and holds onto me all the way from receiving to my desk (this is about a 40 yard walk)

September 13, 2018 at 01:45- Sam sends pictures of “her dirty sink” with her clearly standing in the mirror in nothing but her underwear (messages still on my phone)

September 14, 2018 at 15:00- Christie gets my phone number from work and texts me out of the blue telling me she’s lonely and that I’m invited over and sends me her address (messages still on my phone)

September 17, 2018 at 22:00- Ashley and Christie come to my desk and rub my arms and say they’re “hot”. This lasts for about 3 minutes

September 19, 2018 at 08:30- Sam straight up tells me she “really needs a fuck buddy” then hugs me and buries her face in my chest and asks me to be there for her in her time of need.
_________________________________________________

And that kind of stuff has been going on all year. After what Sam said earlier, it made me think I should finally tell someone about this but I’m wondering if it’s just be a situation where this ends badly for me.

Is this right?","All of my hand tools, my tool bag, my tool belt, my socket set and drill with batteries and a charger were stolen out of my employers 5-ton truck that was on my employers property that was behind a gate that should have been locked by a security personnel, but wasn’t. I rode in the truck but did not have keys for it. I was initially told by my direct superior that the tools would be replaced, but have now found out that the company we both work for will not replace them, even though the loss was because of another one (or multiple) of their employees’ negligence.

More details: there were also two company vehicles stolen and a bunch of company property. I was under the impression that I would have my stuff replaced when the company stuff was missing as they were filing an insurance claim, but they have since recovered the two vehicles and now it seems like my stuff is the only stuff not recovered, and so their tune has changed, and I’m left to fend for myself.

Since returning to school, she has been groped multiple times by her male classmates. She reported this to the principal and after ""conducting an investigation"" he told her that the boys were just joking around and teasing her and she shouldn't take it so seriously. It didn't stop, so I met with the principal and he told me that she wasn't making it clear enough to these boys that she didn't want to be touched. I got nowhere with him, and I'm currently reaching out to everyone I can think of over the principal's head to work on this. All of this has happened in the last couple of weeks.

Yesterday, my daughter wrote ""BOYS ARE NOT ALLOWED TO TOUCH ME"" on a white t shirt and wore it to school. I wasn't aware that she did this but I don't think it was wrong. She was sent home for the day and told that her shirt was inappropriate. I talked to the principal again today and he said that her shirt was sexist because it implied that ""men are animals."" He told me that he was considering expulsion over her t-shirt because it was harassment.

What do I do here? Can they expel my daughter from high school over this? How can I both advance the issue of her being groped and prevent an expulsion?

kallynn1215,2018-09-17 20:04:36+00:00,Hospital Lost Autopsy Record of My Stillborn Baby (CA),"On August 3rd, I was admitted to the hospital for a c-section because my unborn daughter died at 39+3 weeks gestation. I had gone in to the hospital initially that day because I hadn’t been able to feel her move and they couldn’t find a heartbeat. 

I had the c-section at 12:30 AM on August 4th (this is when they note her ‘birth date’). Her medical bracelet lists her last name as my last name, not my husband’s (I kept my maiden name). 

Before the c-section, I had multiple vials of blood drawn to send to a lab to test for anything related to me that could have caused her death (infection, virus, etc.). I also requested a genetic test and an autopsy. These requests were confirmed to me by nurses/the attending OB. 

I was told that my daughter’s body would be transferred to the funeral home the hospital contracts with automatically after the autopsy was performed.

After I was discharged (August 4th), we didn’t hear anything from a funeral home for about a week, and I grew concerned. My father called the hospital (husband and I were not in a position to do much of anything at that point) to find out what the timeline was for receiving my daughter’s ashes back home to me. 

Apparently the hospital had a hard time finding out where my daughter was. Eventually they found her and told my father that it’d be a couple days before the funeral home received her body. I’m not sure if they gave him a reason why. He also asked about the timeline for receiving the results of the autopsy. They told him 30 days from August 6th. 

I got a call from the hospital chaplin, who told me, among other unrelated things, that there’d been some issue finding her records (as initially reported to me by my father) but apparently it was fine now, and to call her if there were any other issues. 

I received my daughter’s ashes, and so I thought was the end of it.

About 3 weeks ago, I received the results of the genetic test, but nothing else.

I contacted my OB’s office on Friday (9/13) because I was concerned I hadn’t heard anything from them yet. 

They don’t have any records of the autopsy OR the lab tests that were sent out. They told me to call the hospital. 

I called the hospital and after almost 2 hours on the phone, they’ve told me that they not only have no record of an autopsy being done, but no record of my child at all. 

I had them try my last name/her father’s last name, alternate dates, under my name, etc. 

They just basically said, we have no idea what happened, but sorry for your loss, bye. 

I have not yet been charged for an autopsy, but I haven’t received any bill from the hospital itself yet.

That report, along with the missing labs, were the only chance I had of understanding why my baby died. 

If they didn’t perform an autopsy, why did it take so long for her body to be received by the funeral home? She could have been here with us, rather than sitting for over a week in a hospital’s morgue. And if they did perform one and simply lost the records, my child was cut up and pulled open for literally no reason. 

I doubt it, but I want to check with people who know more about this than me- do I have any legal recourse here? God forbid this shit show happens to someone else who’s simply trying to grieve for their dead child. Is there anything I can do beyond leaving a review of the hospital? 

I’m simply appalled at the way this has been handled and furious that I’m now in the position where my one chance at understanding her death is gone. Not only that, but we are planning on trying again to have a child, and that information may have been helpful in preventing another stillbirth.

They had been there for a bit when I let my dogs out (balloon wasn't visible from the door or obviously I wouldn't have done so). My dogs are good dogs but frankly hot air balloons are freaking weird and it was new territory for them and they went into a mad panic and attacked the balloon (the people were safe in the basket). I coraled the dogs and they got the balloon hauled out of the yard and into a truck. 

Last night the pilot of the balloon found my email address and sent me several email addresses for information - first homeowner's insurance, second info on my dog's breed and ages, third my address. I can only imagine where he will be going with this.

I know I need to consult a lawyer if this is going to go somewhere but right now I'm not even sure where to start. Am I liable for a balloon my dogs damage that literally lands in my fenced yard?

Quite possibly the largest in the world irrelevant of language. In a word... Wow!

We often can't help with the big stuff, but we excel at helping with the small things that leave many Americans in the dark. Even though these aren't the titanic legal issues that get covered in the news, for the people asking here they are matters of supreme importance. Questions about whether or not a landlord can evict someone, how to get money back from a small loan, car accidents, petty theft, child support, sexual harassment, property rights, rights in the workplace, and yes, tree law, are all things that funded legal aid programs either can't or aren't allowed to assist with. We help bridge that gap. 

We get an average of just under 400 questions per day. That's nearly 3,000 people a week or over 10,000 people a month who find us, ask their question, and hopefully, receive information they can use to arm themselves.

nitekite345,2018-09-16 19:45:36+00:00,"My college says if I miss class to testify at my assault trial, they’ll drop me from my classes","(IA) I was sexually assaulted (while home over a break, not by another university student) and the trial of my attacker starts in two weeks. 

I am a university student about five hours driving distance from my home town where the assault occurred, and I’ll need to travel there to testify at the trial. 

I’d spoken to my advisor and all my professors notifying them of the days I’d be out, and everyone was understanding, giving me take home versions of any tests or work I’d be missing. 

Unfortunately, one of the days I’ll likely need to be out coincides with midterms, so my professor was required to get approval from the academic dean and dean of the college to issue a take home midterm. 

His request for the take home midterm was denied, and when it came to the attention of these deans, they contacted all my professors and informed me if I missed that many classes (it would be approximately two of each class, maybe three depending on some court scheduling, and four of another class but it meets every day of the week.) 

My professors were comfortable marking these as “reported absences” which basically means there was a justification like a doctor’s note or other official documentation. 

I showed the deans that I was in fact being called to testify by the defense so it wasn’t  even really like I had a choice. I figured that would be enough documentation. 

The dean said that “personal non-medical conflicts” could not be counted as reported absences and would be treated as unreported absences, (so, treated as the same thing as if I’d just  slept through class). They suggested I apply for a leave of absence for the semester because otherwise I’d be dropped from my classes at the third absence and be on probation if dropped from two or more classes (school policy). 

This attack took enough from me already, I went to great lengths to be sure I didn’t miss a day of school while recovering, I do not want this man to derail my life further by pushing back my graduation date. 

I spoke to the title IX Office who’d promised me they could help, but it turns out their idea of helping was helping me plan my leave of absence. 

I do not want to take a leave of absence. All my professors were ready and willing to work with me and I was/am entirely capable of keeping up with the work. 

Do I have any legal recourse here against the school?

Frankly I was shocked that she would say this and told her that this is my business and that I will hire who I want. We got into an argument and then I fired her.

This_Is_A_Temp002,2018-09-15 09:14:02+00:00,"I wrote a web app for work on my own time, I was fired, it is not working now the owner wants to sue me.","Throwaway account.

I wrote a web app for work, it is not working now the owner wants to sue me.

Business is in Georgia, I am currently in Florida

Ok, about 1.5 years ago I worked for a small business as a sales agent.  I was not a very good one, but on my own time I made a server run web app that made my job and sales much easier.  Since it worked well I gave the link and password to a few other sales agents to see if they found it useful.  Then after working there for 9-10 months I was fired during a “restructuring”  basically they were not making enough money and the easiest way to save some was to fire someone.  I was not the bottom performing agent, but the 3 agents below me were related to or friends of the owner, so I got canned.  I was thinking of quitting, and the owner did not fight the unemployment claim, so I accepted it and moved on.

A few days ago the app stopped working.  I got a call from my former boss who found out I was the one that had written it and wanted it back up will a whole list of new features.  I told him I would look into to it and to email me the list of new features that he wanted and I would see if we could work something out. 

First I found out it stopped working since the server was taken down for non-payment.  I called the company and tried to get it reactivated.  They made me answer all the security questions and asked stuff like what day/time I setup the account.  I had the original emails and everything else saved in a password manger, and I asked why the 3rd degree.  Turns out someone else claiming to be be me tried to get the account activated.  It did not work since even though they knew the correct answered like my mothers maiden name, I used fake answers so they failed each verification question.  So my boss or someone working for him tried to activate the account without alerting me.

I got into the account, reactivated the tool, downloaded all the logs, and then deactivated the app from the server with a UNDER MAINTENANCE page put up. I checked the logs and the password page was accessed 300-400s a day, which is huge and hard to do since I was on a shared server.  I set it up thinking it would only be used 20 times a day max. I then checked with someone I worked with and still kept in infrequent contact with.  Turns out about 2 months after I was let go, sales went up, two to three times better than when I worked there, some of that was due to the web app that I had made.  Owner had found out I was the one who made it very quickly, but never contacted me until it broke down.  

I looked over the requirements the Owner wanted, found out I would have to completely rewrite the app, and put it on a private server, since the major complaint was that it is slow.  I figured $8000 for the new app and $350 month for maintenance, which would cover server and bandwidth cost. This is very reasonable given the proven profits that the web app had brought, and when he was waiting for the new app with all the new features to be activated the old one can still be used.

I put all this into an email, and gave a basic time table, and a copy of my free lancer work contact and sent if off.  With in an hour I got an angry email and phone call, threatening me to put the app back up now or I would be sued for the thousands of dollars of lost profits, how he owned me, and would make sure I never worked again, and threatened to kill my cat.  Owner also wants the accounts turned over to him, both my email, web domain and web accounts. 

Now I know that Owner has sued people in the past about stuff and had lost most of these suites, it was half a joke around the office.  He gets angry easily, and is a general bully when Owner does not get  Owner’s way. Now I pretty sure I can win if Owner sues me, but I want to make a few points out.

1) I have the phone call and emails recorded, when ever some one calls me there is a little blurb at the beginning that all calls are recorded for quality assurance.

2) I wrote the web app in my own time, on my own laptop.  But I also used my own laptop for work use, since one was not provided to me.

3) The app I wrote, did pull a lot of info and compiled it, including data I entered in on the products that I was selling at the time, this included photos not owned by me, am I screwed by this?

4) My cat died shortly after I moved, but he did threaten to kill it.

5) What type of lawyer do I need, what should I counter sue Owner for if he brings this to court.  I will have to travel a bit to get back to Georgia and take time off my current work, losing money.

6) I made a gmail account that I made myself was used for both work and running the web app, I have moved the web service to another account since, and changed my passwords, but he is demanding both be turned over to him.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9g05u3/i_wrote_a_web_app_for_work_on_my_own_time_i_was/,legaladvice,1344,166,0.0

Not sure if its the same one but refuse to take the chance. 

My wife vehemently refused the rabies series because its a vaccine. I am in panic mode and I am taking her to a hospital over 50 miles away near Dallas. 

Can I kidnap my own daughter? There is not a custody agreement in place because we are married and not separated. Probably will be soon though. 

I need to know what to watch out for here and what to say to police if I get stopped. Rabies is fatal so I am not playing with this one. 

I am leaving here in 10 minutes so just need to know a few things. 

Is it kidnapping in this case?

Will I be arrested?

I called in to work 6 hours early saying that I was in the ER and that I didn’t know when I would be done. My boss asked for a doctor’s note, which I sent once I got my discharge paperwork. The note only said “PATIENT NAME was at HOSPITAL ER on DATE/TIME” under the heading “Work/School Note”.

I said I was uncomfortable doing this as it was private but he doubled down.

I first of all want to say that I am completely fine making accommodations so a child with multiple, severe allergies can go to school. I can’t imagine what his family goes through, and how nerve-wracking this is for them. At the same time, all twenty kids in the class are now affected.


- kids are only allowed to bring in pre-packaged foods and beverages so that the teacher can check the ingredients, so I can’t pack him a sandwich- everything has to be in a sealed package.


- Parents are asked not to serve the children any of the severe allergens for breakfast before coming to school, including peanut butter, eggs and dairy. 


- Parents with pets are asked to dress their children right before leaving the house, to reduce pet dander on clothes. The teacher suggested (but it’s not required) that kids can get dressed in the garage :/

Apprehensive_Horror,2018-09-12 23:08:27+00:00,"Apartment maintenance man saw me in a state of undress, put his finger in my mouth.","Throwaway because of how embarrassing this is for me. Also I'm in Pennsylvania. 

I moved into a new apartment complex at the beginning of August and have had no problems so far. A couple of weeks ago, I called maintenance to take care of peeling paint by my back door. A guy came, he fixed it, and I thought the issue was resolved.

Fast forward to today, I've been extremely sick since the weekend. Today I got back from class, took NyQuil, and just laid down to sleep. I closed my bedroom door as an extra buffer against the noise my neighbors across the hall can sometimes make. I'm a deep sleeper anyway and taking it made me pretty much dead to the world. I had a fever breaking so I got incredibly hot before the medicine kicked in, so I stripped down to just my panties.

These next bits I'm fuzzy on because I was sleeping and didn't witness them. A maintenance guy came back to ""finish my paint job"" and let himself in when I didn't answer the door.  He saw my keys and stuff in my living room so decided to check if I was okay. He let himself into my bedroom and saw me there asleep. My blanket had become a tangled mess so he got a full view of my chest. He then put his finger in my mouth to wake me up. 

I was immediately woken by the finger and this guy told me all of this in a rush while I was incredibly confused and groggy. Then I realized he could see me pretty much naked and screamed at him to get out. 

This happened just a few hours ago and I have no idea what to do. He might be telling the truth about being worried but it really bugs me he went into my bedroom. It bothers me more he put his finger in my mouth because it feels more sexual than just, say, shaking me or something, especially since I was undressed.

One of these room mates, who will be known as 'A' was recently arrested for several felonies, including violent offenses. In the process of arresting him, our house was assaulted by a full tactical team that utilized flash grenades and tear gas. Needless to say, 'A' is in jail, and probably will be for the foreseeable future, unless he bonds out. The court system will not grant the remaining two of us a protective order against 'A' so there is really no way to keep him from coming back to the house if he makes bail (which is set ABSURDLY low, in my opinion.) The other room mate and myself, 'B' and 'C', were not involved in the crime or even aware it was happening until the SWAT team showed up.   


Roommate 'B' doesn't want to stay in the house anymore, for reasons he likens to PTSD. I know exactly what he means, every single little noise has us on edge for fear it could be 'A' coming back after bailing out.  


This is a group lease, we do not lease individual rooms or anything like that.

&amp;#x200B;

This is a very recent event, and we have so far been unable to contact our landlord to let him know any of this has happened.

Around midnight she was holding the 3 year old on the couch in the living room when she felt some move. She got up and turned around and noticed a small snake crawling on the couch. She tried to shoo the snake out the door using a broom but she said he wasn't budging. She called emergency maintenance but they said they don't come out for that. They suggested calling animal control but animal control was closed when she called.  She kept trying to get it out of the door. It moved back like it was going to strike her and tried several times to strike the broom and seemed very agitated. So she sent the 3 year old to her room and she beat the snake until it died. She spent about 40 minutes total trying to remove the snake. She was starting to get pretty fearful it was a baby venomous snake and it just refused to leave. She didn't want to take the chance of losing sight of it and it moving to the kid's room. 

She then moved the dead snake outside and put a towel and tape under the door where she thought it came in at. 

The next morning she requested maintenance fix the gap in the door and remove the snake. 

A neighbor came by and saw the snake and said that was his snake. He is asking for reimbursement for us killing it saying it was harmless. But she had no idea what kind of snake it was. Do we have to reimburse him? 

The apartment came by with a note saying it was illegal to kill snakes and she should have simply relocated it outside. But how? 

What kind of trouble are we looking at? A fine? Is this a go to jail situation?

oneconcernedparent,2018-09-12 08:07:20+00:00,I think my 3 year old is being sexually abused at daycare [x-post from /r/parenting],"Originally posted in /r/parenting, but it was suggested I post here...

My son has been in the same church run daycare/preschool for about a year. At the time, we didn't love the place, but we were desperate because I needed to go back to work and it was the only place that would work with my part time schedule. (We didn't love it because it didn't seem as academic as others, but he was only two so we let it go).

He seems to really like it there. Most days he doesn't even say goodbye to me, he just runs into which ever room they have setup and starts playing. He seems to like some kids and teachers more than others, but that seems normal enough. He occasionally has rough/clingy mornings, but they are pretty rare and seem to correlate with story time on Fridays, but not every Friday.

I'm not sure if some of his new behaviors are unusual or just par for the course for a toddler/threenager. He never used to mind diaper changes, but started kicking and screaming during them sometimes after he started at the daycare. He's always been a strong willed kid, but screaming ""I don't want to"" and ""put me down"" are things he picked up at daycare for whatever reason. I thought it was odd that the church pastor would be reading to the kids sometimes when I dropped my kid off on Fridays, and even weirder that he sometimes had kids in his lap, but the teachers were always there and it was always a group activity.

We had some concerns, but nothing concrete and more that he was learning to hit/push than anything worse. Until today. We finish up dinner and I get the bath ready for our 1 year old, leaving the 3 year old at the dinner table with my husband. I'm minding my business, bathing the baby when my husband comes into the bathroom to relay something the 3 year old just did and said. It should be noted that our toddler doesn't yet speak in complete sentences or fully respond when   asked questions (ex ""what did you do at school today?"" gets no answer while ""did you paint at school today?"" garners an appropriate ""yep!"" or ""nope!""). Our toddler had finished his dinner and, after we had cleaned up his plate, he asked for peanut butter pretzels, one of his favorite snacks. Normally, we'd say no, but he'd been a good kid all day so my husband said ""sure! But cheek kiss first"" and leaned into our normally very affectionate kiddo. Our son slapped my husband across the face and said ""no! Pretzels now!"". Not great, but not out of the ordinary for him after a long day (we don't hit our kids, but he definitely struggles with hitting when he's frustrated). He did/said this twice and then said ""get candy!"". My husband said ""no candy right now"" and then asked ""do you get candy at school?"" Our son then grabbed two of my husband's fingers, rubbed the tips with his fingers several times, said ""it's round, it's round"" and then licked them repeatedly. He did this several times. (Just typing this is making me nauseous again). My husband asked if that's how he got candy and our son repeated the behavior/motion and then put his finger to his lips and said ""shhhh!"", then put his other pointer finger to my husband's lips and said ""shhhh!"" (We only ever use ""shhh"" to comfort them when crying and have never put our fingers to his or our lips). My husband tried to gently ask more questions, but our son just mumbled nonsense and then asked to get out of his highchair.

My husband came and told me immediately and we got the baby out of the tub, and tried to talk to the toddler again, but he'd moved on and just wanted to go sit on the couch. We didn't know what to do (this was around 730pm), so we called local PD dispatch and they sent over an officer who just told us to speak to the director of the school.

I've tried searching this sub and others and have come across a few sort of related posts, but I have no idea what to do. Local resources open in the morning, and we have already told our workplaces that we won't be in tomorrow due to a family emergency, but we don't know where to start. I can't in good conscience send him back there again.

Are we overreacting? Do we just confront the director? How do we handle this? I obviously don't know what or who exactly, but this definitely seems off. Any thoughts or advice would be appreciated.

Panda-92,2018-09-11 03:06:00+00:00,Can I call CPS if a neighbor's child keeps coming into my home?,"I live in Colorado. 

My neighbors have a severely autistic child. He is nonverbal. He spends a lot of time just screaming. I'm not concerned by this, per se, because I understand he is autistic.

However, his parents leave him outside in their backyard a lot. Sometimes at night time. Sometimes in the middle of winter. He sits in the backyard and screams. Whatever. Maybe he screams more inside. I don't know. 

Recently, he's started climbing the camper in their backyard, or climbing the fence into my backyard. I'll find him sitting on my back porch or hanging out in my gazebo. I never use my backyard, so who knows what kind of rusty nails or other dangerous things are buried in the dirt. I'm scared he's going to fall off camper or off the fence, or injure himself in my yard. The first few times this happened, I called the neighbors or knocked on their door and told them to come get their kid. They don't answer right away. It takes them 20 minutes to come to the door. But when they do, they are apologetic and come to get him. Yet, it keeps happening.

Now, he has started coming into the backyard and then into my home. My back door stays unlocked, because I've locked myself out of the house too many times. I have a large dog, who luckily is friendly, but I still don't trust 100% around an autistic child. My house is also under renovation, so there are exposed nails and spaces where this kid could crawl and get stuck. I am also afraid that he might come in while I'm not home, and then go out the front door and let the dog loose, or get himself lost or hit by a car. 

Today was the second day in a row that he came into my home. This time, when I took him home, I told the neighbors that they need to supervise him better or I would feel obligated to report it, because I don't want to see him get hurt. The father immediately started screaming at me to get off his property. 20 minutes later, the mom comes knocking on my door and tells me that if I call CPS, she can file harassment charges against me. 

Is this true? I'm worried about this boy. I'm worried that one day he will go missing, or get severely injured. But I don't want to get into legal trouble for calling the hotline.

Now, come the end of the week, I get suspended from work because one of the supervisors reported that I had gotten aggressive with them, on the day that I went to Urgent Care. Because of the report being made by a supervisor, it had immediately been escalated to a suspension and ultimately my being fired.

Now, unfortunately, I was never actually told what the situation was that got me in trouble until after I was fired, and the only way I even learned what had happened was because there were two short lines explaining the incident on my termination paperwork. Basically, around 2PM I'm reported escalating a conversation into yelling at a supervisor. I was at the Urgent Care Ward at 3PM, over an hour away.

Currently I'm trying to get into contact with HR to get the post-visit summary to them, as my ""manager"" at the time was a back-up for my normal manager, so they don't seem to have gotten the memo that I was out that week for medical reasons. The office is gigantic, and I actually enjoyed my job, so I'm hoping I can just get put back into things quick and easy.

Honestly, I am pretty upset that I lost my job, however at this point I'm relatively calm and optimistic. Weighing in my hospital visit, in order to have been responsible for the situation, I would have had to drive 30+ miles through the Bay Area weekday traffic in less than an hour. Short of me stopping time or teleporting, it just isn't physically possible, especially when I don't have a driver's license.

Is there anything I should be worried about? I have documentation from my hospital which explains I was in Urgent Care when the supervisor made this report. As I mentioned before, I'm more than a little upset that this happened, but I'm trying to just settle things at getting my termination reversed.

Without exaggeration, this was probably the of the worst of my life. 

After getting served the injunction/temporary restraining order thing, my brother 1. told my parents and 2. chose to immediately violate it. He left me several messages that essentially was low key threatening to ruin my life and I was scared so I reported it. He was taken to jail and to my current understanding is going to get a type of misdemeanor charge for it if he already hasn't. I don't know if hes in jail right now.

I knew my parents were going to take his side but they have effectively disowned me for this. My parents are very religious conservative catholics (i'm not religious anymore but they don't know that) and they were very upset by me reporting it. Thats an understatement. I have enough scholarships where I will be able to continue paying for my living expenses/school with my part time job but they way they treated me was horrible. They're very upset because thisll probably screw up his college according to the talks we've had. They said i'm disgusting/not welcome home etc. My dad sent me a video of him and my mom burning most of the belongings i left at his house (not much important to me but still). they don't believe me about the camera and my dad said he specifically didnt care even if it was there. just screaming the entire time, i stopped answering my phone and checking my email because it terrifies me. i bought a new cheap computer because even though someone helped me wipe it clean i'm honestly too scared of using the old one at this point.

i haven't left my room in a week. the worst of it is over i think but i feel like i felt in a pit. I can't stop crying.

Do we have recourse or legal issues wuth the GFM?","(I am passing this along from my mother who is a much more concise writer than myself. If more detail is needed please let me know and I can provide more! thanks for your help, all)

Since mid-July, I have been helping a homeless, pregnant, abused 31 year old 
woman of color and her 11 year daughter who fled another state to escape the 
abuser. My efforts have been aimed at keeping a safe roof over their heads, food in their bellies, providing for clothing and personal care needs, medical and 
prescriptions needs (pregnant diabetic with high blood pressure), car repairs and registration, and other fairly basic needs. The process has been fraught with 
problems and complications, including suicidal ideations/potentially self-harming actions and various attempts by others to extort money from me under the guise of helping the victims or sometimes under threats causing them harm/misfortune. This week after committing a traffic violation, I learned that this woman was operating under an alias. When I researched her real name, I realize I had been conned into spending a lot of money to help someone who actually was acting with criminal intent. My concern is that early on I started a Go Fund Me, received $1300 that I spent on food, clothing, rent, and car repairs, and I now feel an ethical (if not moral and perhaps legal) obligation to notify the donors, as well as to refund their money to them. Looking for advice as to what to do and how to go about it. This has been reported to police and is currently being investigated.

ChemyFresh,2018-09-08 00:19:35+00:00,"[Phoenix] Went to a strip club drunk. Agreed to some charges, but blacked out and woke up to a bill for basically my life savings ($15,000). The strip club employees were serving me drinks illegally (no liquor license). Is this coercion? Do I have any legal recourse?","So, here's the situation... I went to a strip club moderately drunk. I agreed to a private dance for \~$600. The strip club made me sign a paper, took my fingerprint, as well as a picture of me. I remember agreeing to additional time and then the dancers started giving me drinks (illegal in AZ because full nude strip clubs are not allowed to serve alcohol). The night got very fuzzy, and the last thing I remember is being absolutely dumbfounded when they handed me a bill for $15,000. I was there for less than 3 hours and I highly doubt that I would agree to those charges knowingly even while drunk. I briefly argued with the bouncer before going home. When I woke up the next day and realized basically my life savings was gone, I spiraled into an absolutely horrible depression, tried to kill myself several times, relapsed on heroin (after several years clean), and wound up in rehab. I'm doing better now, and have been disputing the charges with my credit card company, but it sounds like responses from the merchant are starting to come in, and I will need to provide some sort of proof or written statement corroborating my side of the story. Is it worth talking to a lawyer in this situation? My understanding is that someone cannot legally enter into a contract while intoxicated? Is there a coercion angle to this since they were illegally serving me alcohol?

Also, it might be worth noting that the establishment I went to is apparently notorious for doing this. If you read their yelp reviews, this is apparently a scam they pull frequently on customers.

DumbAnubis,2018-09-07 04:34:06+00:00,[Michigan] Disabled brother and mother denied disablity entrance/exit at college and degraded,"Hi. Sorry for spelling mistakes, i just spent the day calming my brother down, it's really hard as i am the provider and keep a roof over our heads, my mother, myself, and my disabled brother. I grew up with him, and he was crying and talking about wanting to kill himself all day. It's really hard, as he's completely disabled and it hurts my heart. He's asleep now and i'm done crying myself.   


Basically, my local college has a wheelchair accessible entrance/exit, where people with disability can catch the Disability Bus / Get dropped off or Picked up. My mom wears a scarf, this important, because the security for some reason always stops my poor old mother and gives her shit constantly. My mom is a frugal little old lady that's been through a lot of shit and doesn't need this, but she always try her best to communicate with her poor english skills. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, The security guard denied my mother entrance, although the Van is clearly marked Wheelchair Accessible (It's a very expensive van that i saved up for a long time to get). The same security officer saw my mom drop off my brother earlier, but for some reason he would not let her in and my brother was on the other side of the barrier. He was blocking the enterence with his car. My brother was on the sidewalk, and the sidewalk is 4 Inches high, making it impossible to get down, especially that he's on a 400LB electric wheelchair. Meaning my brother can't get off the sidewalk to cross the parking lot (With moving cars) to get to my mother. She needs to park in the designated disability parking and lower the ramp onto the sidewalk. My mother pleaded with the man as my brother asked him to please move the car as he clearly needs my mother to get into the specifically designated wheelchair pickup/drop off area. The officer then proceeded to harass my mother and brother, and used very vulgar language and yelled at them infront of the whole school. Passerbys confronted the security officer and told him my brother is very clearly disabled and can't leave the school. The officer then started threatening action against my mother and brother and my mom told him that he didn't need to be doing this and that all he needs to do is let her in to pick up her son. The rent-a-cop then said pretty rude things and mocked my brother for being disabled with things like ""That's his own problem"" (Directed at my brother) and ""You brought this on yourself when you had him"" (Towards my mother). My brother and mother then had to wait for the entire parking lot to clear, then go back into the school, go to the other side, find someone to hold the doors open for him, then leave, and drive on the side walk for a long time until he could find a bike ramp to get off the sidewalk onto the road.   


My mother came home crying and my brother shortly after. My mother has spent the entire day in her room. Mind you my mother has attempted to commit suicide before, we haven't exactly had the best life with our dad leaving us and having to care for my disabled brother with her having to tend to his day to day needs whilst i work. My brother has also attempted suicide, and today we had to hold him down and get a knife out of his hand as he was trying to slit his own wrist. We all talked about it and hugged and he's okay now, he's in his bed and i made him laugh a bit. I made my mom laugh and took her out a bit and got her some nice flowers and stuff from the store. To be honest i've just been done crying and my suicidal thoughts have past just now and i was able to bring myself to type this out.   


Multiple times have called the schools accessibility counselor and complained that:   
The ramp is too steep. My brother has fallen face first onto the concrete MULTIPLE times within the past 3 Years. My brother has scraped his hands and skinned his elbows on the ramp because it's too narrow and too steep.   
Today was a first. Never have i seen such cruelty towards a person with disability. I thought it was just a thing in the movies, but this person was legitimate angry at my brother for being disabled and enjoyed taunting him and making his life worst and showed no remorse. I've made a complaint against the security/rent-a-cop to the school right after the incident but they were basically non-caring and sounded like they weren't going to do anything.   


Now my question is, what can i do? I want to make this right. My brother is probably not going to be going back to college, and it's the only thing that is keeping him happy. He told me he felt embarrassed and didn't want to go back during our talks today, i wanted to take him and go to the deans office. My mother is just a wreck. She already hates her life enough, now it's even more and i fear she might actually kill herself. I wont be sleeping tonight and i keep opening the doors and checking if they're okay, i have all the keys and knives next to me and no pills are out of my sight. I'm sure there are multiple  Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) violations, and i'm pretty sure there's some law out there that prevents this kind of harsh mis-treatment. It was very discriminatory and they outright denied my brother use of the wheelchair accessible portion of the building. What can i do? Who can i talk to? How do i do it?  


Thank you.

I was walking down the street 4 blocks away from my house after spending the night at a buddys place, across the street I see some kids just going about, talking etc. this was around 3 AM. When I walked right across, after a few moments, the kids start following me, some of them stay behind though. I take one look and one of them, 12 years old, starts running. I, being the naive idiot I usually am, thought he wanted to ask me something. In retrospect, I don’t know what I was thinking??? What could have he possibly wanted, directions??

I stop walking and turn around, and thankfully the kid was probably inexperienced with the knife because being still kind of far, he pulls out a knife. i immediately teach for my purse and pepper spray and try to show it so he stops approaching, but he still goes, so I start shouting and when he’s finally near, spray him in the face, elbow him, push him away and run all the way to my house. The other kids unfortunately saw where I was heading, and the next day the parents were knocking on my door. Now I find out I’m being sued for “assaulting” their kid, despite saying the entire story.

Hankscorpiohammocks,2018-09-06 13:41:58+00:00,A coworker took photos of us at work and photoshopped them sexually. He has committed other offenses. My company won't fire him.,"I [25-29F] work for a major and well known public transportation company in Canada that has a previous sexual harassment case go public when the company failed to protect one of it's employees.

All the victims involved in this particular story were forced (they would not start an investigation without one) to sign confidenality agreements.

The man was taking photos of us at work and pornographically photoshopping them for his personal pleasure. He also did this with the social media photos. He shared these images with another male teammate, who, uncomfortable, did not come forward. He eventually confessed to the women involved, but no longer had the photos for proof. It was offered he would contact his cell provider to obtain them.

An investigation was launched and the man admitted to taking photos of us at work. HR gave hand written apology letters to the victims from the harasser (I know), and he verbally apologized to others he hurt but weren't involved in the original investigation.

They promised the women involved if he did anything sexually offside to anyone he would be removed.

He was sending me shirtless photos along with perceived sexual images (one of what appeared to be a graphic vagina but zoomed out to be an elbow). He committed this after signing his agreement he would not do this again.

My investigation was found true but the company still will not fire him and I have to the work with him. Their solution was I could work from home and they would ""try their best"" to make sure we aren't around each other. They said they could not guarantee it and there may be times a manager is not available to ensure it won't happen.

After not feeling heard, I asked why he wasn't let go when he has two sexual harassment cases against him. The HR representative said, ""You feeling like it is sexual harassment does not make it so."" I asked her to clarify and asked if the company reported it in his file as sexual harassment. She said she couldn't tell me that due to ""his privacy.""

I'm not sure what course of action I can take to get myself remove. They won't allow me to switch departments (I have to APPLY if a job posting is OPEN and only if the manager naturally wants me). They also won't allow me to work on another floor. Right now I am going to work from home, but I am still required in the office and still required to be near him.

We have a whistle blower holine and Canada has a human rights violation office. I'm not sure if any of this would qualify, but I will be let go if I go to the whistle blower.

TL;DR My company is protecting a man who was taking pictures of us at work for sexual fulfillment and photoshopping them to be pornographic. HR has made everyone be quiet and I feel forced into working with the abuser.

She called the cops, saying I was suicidal and took her documents. The cops understood I was not suicidal and I later mailed the copy of her documents that I accidentally took because they were in my own documents (FAFSA). She called my therapist many times and she believes I am hoarding pills and bipolar (I'm neither; she's actually the one with bipolar disorder). I know my therapist sides with me but is good about being neutral.
My friend is in contact with my sister, who told him that mother may have found a way to get me back in her care or removed from college. The resident assistant director stopped by my dorm when I wasn't home saying he had a letter for me, according to my roommate. I got an email asking him to call but i did and he's not in the office since it's night now.
What can she do? I'm assuming she'll try the mental health card since I have been hospitalized for suicide when I was 17, but I am not depressed now. What legality will she try to find? How can I stop it?

My entire family and I are naturalized citizens from Mexico. We were all born and raised in Mexico and we tend to visit a lot of family and friends on an almost daily matter. We live in San Diego and in order to avoid hours of waiting at the border, we applied for and received [Sentry cards](https://www.cbp.gov/travel/trusted-traveler-programs/sentri/how-apply-sentri). We are hard-working people, engineers, educators, pay our taxes, etc...

My father was crossing back across the border into the US in one of the sentry lanes during labor day at around 7 PM. My father was driving, my mother in the passenger seat, and my pregnant sister-in-law and my niece were in the back of the car. According to the accounts of my family, there were two border patrol officers on the passenger side checking sentry cards before the actual booth. One of the officers made a hand signal in the shape of a license, implying that my dad flash the sentry cards, which he did - but the officer did not see it. The officer starts walking in front of the vehicle towards the driver side door while making the same motion and yelling something out which my father does not make out (he is deaf). He starts banging on the drivers side door. My father once again flashes the sentry cards and says ""Here it is!"". 

My family says that the officer did not like the tone my father was using and said ""OK. I'm gonna get your sentry card taken away"". My father opens the car door, confused and interpreting the banging on it as the officer asking to open it up. The officer then proceeds to choke my dad, drag him out of the car and handcuff him. My mother tried to explain that my father was deaf and wasn't understanding what the officer wanted. He replied with ""I don't care"".

Afterwards, my father was taken to a processing facility and released without any charges - except the officer was successful in taking his sentry card.

For obvious reasons this angers me - it really complicates our way of life here in a border city. I'd like to recover my dads sentry card.

Iron__Maiden,2018-09-04 13:30:53+00:00,A good friend and neighbor recently passed away and left me 5% of his surprisingly large will. Now his adult son is suing me (Virginia).,"So basically, I lived next door to my neighbor for around 5 years. He was a widower in his early 60s, and we quickly bonded. We watched football together, drank together, and all that. I even went to his church every now and then, even though it's not my bag. The point, I guess, is that even though he had 30 years on me, we were friends. I think this point is important.




He recently passed, which sucks. Then I learned he left me a little something. That little something turned out to be just over $40,000, which nearly knocked my dick off since I had no idea he had that kind of money. That 40k, though a lot of money, was ""only"" around 5% of his net worth. So it's not like I'm getting the majority of his estate. But then his son, who I'd met a couple times, sued me (as of yesterday), claiming that  I ""took advantage"" of his elderly father. 




I have three things going for me:




1. My friend was mentally acute. He had his share of health problems (pack-a-day smoker), but none of them were mental.




2. Our town's not big, and I know people who can attest to the fact that we went to the bar and church and watched football together, proving that we actually had a relationship. Hell, I even mowed his lawn, which our neighbors can attest to. These people can be witnesses I think, though I don't know how civil suits work.


3. His adult daughter is a very nice lady, and has no problems with her dad leaving me some of his estate. She came around from time to time, and knew her dad and I hung out and stuff. The first time I met her, her dad and I were watching college football in our robes while sitting on my porch and drinking beer (we live in the South so that's acceptable behavior for grown men). 





Basically, my point is he and I were friends, and does the son have a pot to piss in regarding this lawsuit? Also, what kind of lawyer should I hire? The lawyer who did his will seemed like a straight shooter, but I don't know if me hiring him is a conflict of interest or if he's even the right kind of lawyer to represent me.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9cvmf2/a_good_friend_and_neighbor_recently_passed_away/,legaladvice,14216,219,0.0
Electrical_Shape,2018-09-02 22:47:53+00:00,(Wisconsin) Grocery store broke my real ID in half while I was trying to buy alcohol,"Last year a grocery store opened on my college campus, they sell alcohol as well. Since the school year has just started and there have been an influx of freshmen with fake ID's, they seem to have been cracking down on checking ID's. Today I went to buy alcohol (I am 21) and showed them my real ID which says I am 21. I am from a state that is pretty far away from Wisconsin so I expected them to scrutinize my ID, but the cashier accused me of having a fake ID and said ""your excuses aren't working"" when I told her it was real. They told me I could come back with the police if it was actually real. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I walked down the street to the university police station and told them what was going on, luckily they were able to look me up in the student directory and verify that I am 21. They had an officer walk back to the store with me where I discovered that the manager had actually snapped my ID into two pieces and placed it in a drawer with all the other confiscated fake ID's. The officer I was with told them that he had verified I am actually 21 and they apologized and said they understand my frustration but there is nothing they can do. The police officer said it was up to the store if they do anything to reimburse me or fix the situation and then left. The manager did give me the two pieces of my snapped ID back.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm frustrated because that was my real ID, I now have no driver's license or a way to prove that I am over 21 besides a birth certificate and I won't be able to go back to my home state anytime soon to get a replacement ID (although I can try to get one in Wisconsin). Is there any way I can take legal action against the store? I feel like I was treated really unfairly here.

She suffers from depression and anxiety and used to self-harm.

I played dumb and agreed that he is a pretty great cat and she should try to find one like him when she moves. Then she said it - ""or I could just take him with me...""

I said absolutely not. I reminded her that my husband found him as a stray kitten a decade ago and loves him almost as much as me. She kept going on about how she needs him more than we do, and joked that she's going to run away with him. I told her in no uncertain terms that she will not be taking our cat.

I’m on mobile and don’t know how to link my previous post but here’s a summary: an idiotic neighbor kept taking pictures of and with my vehicle in our underground garage and posted them on social media claiming the car is his. 

I thought this dumbass needs a dose of online shaming so here’s what I did. His social media accounts have a pretty high followership (10-12k) and as others suggested, he is indeed some kind of “guru” scammers. I don’t really wanna say what type of scammer for privacy reasons (not that he deserves any). Well, I only have Twitter so I took it there. During his last photoshoot with my car, I took a few photos for evidence. I chose one of those pictures, tagged him in the tweet and wrote: “I see [his handle] loves my car. That’s cool but would be nice if he didn’t try to brag about a car he doesn’t own. This is him during one of the photoshoots in our shared garage.” 

Of course, it didn’t take long until 1) dude deleted ALL the pictures of my car and 2) contacted me to threaten a lawsuit for libel (?) if I don’t apologize to HIM publicly for embarrassing him in front of his “fans” and delete said Tweet. My ass was laughing so hard. I didn’t reply which seemed to only piss him off even more because he was sending me angry emojis and curse words. I should also that my tweet gained traction and has around 120 replies and 300 RTs (I’m getting famous too!). Mostly, people are bashing him and saying what a retard he is. Others started making fun of his other posts (eg “I’m starting to doubt he actually ate at that restaurant. Probably just took a picture and left”). Moreover, this scammer apparently claimed on social media that he lives on a mansion on Lake Washington and some of the commenters put two and two together and realized that he is actually my neighbor and there is no mansion. 

This dude basically says that it is my fault that all these people are making fun of him and that I am destroying his business (?). I’m not particularly afraid of his lawsuit and my lease ends next month after which I will be moving out so I don’t really care. My question is, did I do something legally wrong?

University. 

3 people are involved. Me (17F), my classmate (18F), and an autistic roommate (18?F). 

We started school recently and I got roomed with an autistic roommate who’s in a wheelchair (A). She was ok at first but watches porn on full volume at our room a lot. I have to tell her to turn it down or use earbuds. It wasn’t a big problem. Our room is placed so that I can see her computer monitor very clearly but I let her do whatever she wants. I’m not sure how to act near autistic people so I pretty much just greet her and make small conversations. 

Last week, it was really late at night and I was reading but something caught my attention. Usually her porn doesn’t bother me but I saw some disgusting stuff that I never want to ever see again. I told our RA and they launched an investigation against her. They soon dropped it and chalked it up to her being autistic (wtf?). And that I should just tell her to turn it off if I ever see her watching it again. 

Then two days ago, I walked into the bathroom. They were the last in line. And I saw A looking under B’s skirt and about to poke B down there. So I was like “A, what the fuck are you doing” and B realized what A was doing and was horrified. A started crying but I couldn’t understand her. I want to report her to the police but I’m afraid that the university is going to brush it off by using the “autistic” excuse. 

I’ve seen people on Reddit saying they’re autistic so that means A was fully conscious of what she’s doing and autism is not an excuse, right? 

I’m so afraid of getting in trouble with the university and I’m not comfortable with rooming with A anymore. What do I do? ",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9c87n8/can_i_get_in_trouble_if_i_report_my_classmate/,legaladvice,1039,109,0.0

It resulted in a very boring 5 days in a hospital, a $1200 hospital bill, and my gun rights being taken away from me.

The officer who showed up was on high alert from the moment he arrived, and he looked at a steak knife in my room (for steak and only steak) and pretended like that's evidence of some kind of potential threat, which he used for the involuntary commitment even though I was calm and not a danger to myself or anyone else.

stuck_traveler,2018-09-01 10:37:15+00:00,TL;DR Airline says I was a no show on flight (but I can prove I was on it) and cancelled my return reservation - Need Advice," 

Need advice or help about traveling home to the US.

​

On August 15th, I flew from the US to Croatia with a stop-over in Munich. My return flight to the US is scheduled for September 4th. I booked my flights through online 3rd party budget ticket agent.

​

My problem is that apparently the airline is saying that I was a no show for my flight from Munich to Zagreb in August, even though I was on the plane. They cancelled my future flight with them on September 4th claiming it is their policy to cancel return flights if a passenger no shows. (But again, I didn't no show. I was on the flight.)

​

I have called my travel agent company multiple times but get the same answer - they tell me every time that they need to verify with the airline, put me on hold, and then tell me the airline will not budge - the airline shows me as a no show and won't reinstate my return flight. The travel agency says there is nothing they can do since it is the airline's policy and the agency wants me to purchase a new return flight, which I cannot really afford, and don't think I should have to anyway.

I called the airline directly and they keep saying that their register is showing me as a no show for the Munich to Zagreb flight. But I was on that flight. When I arrived and boarded the plane in Munich, I was told there was not an actual attendant to check us into the flight so we were guided to scan our tickets and board the plane, which I did, along with the other passengers. There are people who sat next to me on the plane and I had conversations with who can witness I was there, besides airport CCTV which I am sure can prove I boarded the plane and exited the plane in Zagreb. I have a visa stamp in my passport from going through the boarder in the airport. It is so scary to me to think this airline allowed someone to board the plane and has no record of them on the flight. What type of security is that??

​

I need help - I am at a stalemate. I am not sure what to do since I was 100% on that flight and it is the airline who made the mistake. I have been recording the names and numbers and taking notes of all my conversations. Can anyone give advice on what I should do? I have 3 more days before my planned return flight should leave. Any help is greatly appreciated.

​

TL;DR My airline made a mistake and said I was a no show even though I was on the flight. Subsequently, they cancelled my upcoming return flight reservation. Neither the airline nor my travel agent will fix it, as they both push it off on each other.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9c24v0/tldr_airline_says_i_was_a_no_show_on_flight_but_i/,legaladvice,4973,327,0.0
allthethings13,2018-08-31 13:47:50+00:00,UPDATE: The saga of the 3 year old and the EpiPen,"I really appreciate all the advice and personal stories shared with me last week. This is my first experience dealing with my son’s allergy in school so I clearly had/have a lot to learn. 

I was able to get a letter from the pediatrician stating that the EpiPen must be kept in the classroom. The teacher now has it stored in a high cabinet, along with a written emergency action plan that details how and when to administer it. I provided her with a clear plastic case with a child resistant cap that I ordered from Amazon and was made for precisely this purpose. The teacher and the classroom aide were trained by the school nurse in how to use it. I also made certain that written instructions would be provided to any substitute teacher or alternate caregiver my son may be left with. 

We have a rotating schedule where parents take turns providing snacks for the entire class. The teacher has asked that these snacks all be peanut free. Neither myself or the teacher have asked that the other students make their individual lunches peanut free; I simply requested that my son be seated away from anyone eating food containing peanuts. Since each little table only seats 4 kids, this has been easy to implement. 

I also provided a second EpiPen, a bottle of liquid Benadryl and a copy of the emergency plan to the front office. I also confirmed that multiple adults at the school have access to the medications locked in the office and are trained to administer them if necessary. 

Most of the advice I received on my original post was very supportive and helpful. However I was baffled by the amount of judgement and criticism I received from the rest of the comments. For those of you who suggested that my son doesn’t have the right to be enrolled in school, I hope you never have a loved one with an allergy, a disability or a learning difference. For those of you who thought I was advocating for my THREE YEAR OLD to inject himself, I recommend that you brush up on your reading comprehension skills. For those of you that thought I was being reckless by putting the EpiPen in his backpack...maybe you had a point. Its true that I never considered another child would get ahold of it or that my son would lose it. I took your words to heart and found a solution we can all live with.

Now let’s just hope we never need to use it.....

mikehocksbig,2018-08-30 18:19:21+00:00,Update- My dentist was arrested,"I want to first thank everyone here for the awesome advice you gave! I have never been in a situation where I needed legal advice, so it was all very unfamiliar to me. I really do appreciate everyone taking the time to respond and help me. I have followed what I was told here, and I wanted to give everyone an update on my situation. 

&amp;#x200B;

First, let me give everyone a little clearer picture of what was happening. The person in question owned the practice that I was visiting. She employed an actual dentist, but she herself was not licensed as anything at all, and had no business touching patients. Most of my work was done by her and a dentist together. Obviously I can't see what's going on in my mouth, so I'm not sure what she did and what he did, but according to the information I've gotten, she shouldn't have been touching me or anyone else. This person's husband was a local police officer, and I am a firefighter. This office gave discounts to public safety and offered no interest financing, so a lot of public safety used these offices. 

&amp;#x200B;

People were also wondering how this could happen, and how anyone could be fooled. This is a large dentist office. Everything was nice, nothing looked or felt strange, and everyone was friendly. I wasn't in someone's basement or in the back of a tattoo parlor getting dental work done. This was a freestanding brick building with ten dental chairs, full staff, and the waiting room was always full. 

&amp;#x200B;

The first thing I did was visit another (actual) dentist. Unfortunately I was given bad news. Everything that was done at the previous office has to be repaired or replaced. I have two root canals that weren't done properly, four crowns that I'm experiencing sensitivity in that aren't seated correctly, an additional crown that has to be replaced, and a filling that was done incorrectly, resulting in that tooth now needing a root canal and crown. My final treatment plan to correct all of this from the new dentist is right at $12,000.00.

&amp;#x200B;

Next, I contacted the DA's offices from both counties where this office operated. The DA explained that they were looking into cases where this person worked on patient's without a dentist present, and seemed uninterested in my case because I couldn't tell them of a specific instance where it was just me and the office owner without a dentist present. They still took my information and the records I collected, and said they may look into it further. 

&amp;#x200B;

I also contact an attorney. The attorney did not seem optimistic at all about the outcome of this. He is currently reviewing everything I've given him, and we were meet again next week. I'm not sure whether or not he will be taking this case, but I will be sure to update everyone here when I find something out. The attorney stated that the practice may not have insurance, lots of people will be going after her, and because a dentist was present I may not have much of a case. I will likely get a second opinion of this attorney declines to take the case. My dental work was done over a period of several years as I could afford it, and $12,000.00 is nothing to sneeze at for me. If it can work in my favor, I certainly need it to!

&amp;#x200B;

I also called my insurance company at the advice of the DA because of the insurance fraud aspect of this. There was a language barrier, and they couldn't seem less interested. After a frustrating five minutes trying to explain things, I hung up.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

This happened in Georgia, USA. If you would like more information, or you would like to see the news story, just google ""Georgia dentist arrested"" and you will have many, many stories on this case. I'm not sure if I am able to post links here, so I'll leave it at that. It's also interesting to note that she is out of jail and back at the office operating like usual.

&amp;#x200B;

Once again, thank you all for your help. No matter the outcome, I am appreciative to everyone here for at least helping me make a run at things.

jessbird,2018-08-30 04:25:07+00:00,[UPDATE] I euthanized my Airbnb host's dog.,"[Original post here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/94vkbg/found_an_abandoned_dog_while_on_vacation_and_had/)

Firstly, I wanted to thank everyone who replied to my original post with such kind and encouraging words. Unfortunately, this is a very boring and uneventful update, but I've had several messages about the incident in the last couple weeks so I figured I'd post something real quick. 

In short, I contacted Airbnb about the issue to 1) make sure they wouldn't take down my honest review once I posted it and 2) to see if they could talk to the host about the clear animal welfare issue. They assured me of both and gave me a $25 coupon for my trouble (lmao). My review went up last week. The host didn't write me a review.

I also contacted the vet to get records of the incident, and the receptionists I spoke with were incredibly sweet. They told me, off the record, that I should contact animal control about these folks, so I did. 

I called every animal control center within 50 miles of the place, and all of them told me the place I stayed wasn't within their jurisdiction so they wouldn't be able to do anything about it. Even when I said, ""But the place is in X County, and you're the animal control office for X County..."" they'd say, ""Well the address doesn't come up in our directory, so maybe try calling the Y County Animal Control."" It was super fucking frustrating and I ultimately wasn't able to have anyone go out and speak to the owners. However, even if they had, they would have found a thriving farm full of healthy animals, and I doubt anything would have happened. My theory is no one was willing to drive out into the desert over an animal that was already dead. 

So, that's kind of that. My review is so long I doubt anyone will read it, and they get so many visitors it'll just get shuffled down very quickly as new positive reviews pour in. But it was the least I could do. Hopefully I spooked them into taking better care of their animals in the future.

Simple_Crazy,2018-08-30 04:23:31+00:00,TX - Update to Free lunch or Theft question.,"So after I posted this here 3 weeks ago I got an official response from my job. 

https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/95mupo/tx_free_lunch_on_fridays_and_other_random_days_or/

First off I spoke with my uncle who is a police detective for Richardson Texas. He laughed and said he hears this once or twice every few years. 

Food left in a common area that is clearly going to be abandoned is not stolen unless the owner specifically instructs you not to touch it. He added on to that saying that after business hours a sign stating ""For finance team only"" can be ignored as it is clearly going to the dumpster soon. 

He did say technically I could be charged with theft if I ate food from that specific VP's area again so I should not do so unless given approval. 

Which is what I did. 

After talking with my uncle, I forwarded the email off to my boss, a vp for my area, and his boss the EVP over the area. The both responded back that they thought it was BS as that I should not feel guilty for eating abandoned food. The EVP responded with we are all one team, teamwork makes the dream work, and other platitudes of core values that he could work into the email. He suggested that we possibly amend the employee handbook and include a section regarded food in it. We had had issues with food recently regarding stolen from fridge food, overly smelly food that causes a distraction when people eat from their desks, and issues with contract employees being left out of area parties because they were contractors. 

The CEO was apparently CCed on the email and replied stating that he would directly speak to the VP that admonished me and included the head of HR in it. He directed the head of HR amend the employee handbook in regards to food. 

Today, every employee was emailed an amended employee handbook that we all had to esign and turn in. 

The policy for food to basically state no one in an area is to be excluded from company parties. This means contractors cant be told to keep working while everyone else eats. Excluding company parties, everyone MUST eat in the provided break rooms, and that all food left out unattended after the end of normal business hours is to be considered abandoned. Meaning that if food is left in an area after 6pm local time, its free to eat or be thrown away. 

I was feeling a little smug after signing that and randomly decided to see if she complained in any teams chat. As the admin over it, I can read every teams chat. I could not find her in teams so I looked her up in AD. She had a nice little down arrow by her name. 

For those that do not know. When you look up a person in active directory and they have a down arrow by their name, it means their account has been deactivated and all access has been pulled. Which means they have been fired. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9bghx7/tx_update_to_free_lunch_or_theft_question/,legaladvice,1759,1,0.0

DifficultPath,2018-08-30 02:21:07+00:00,My brother hacked into everything and is trying to control my life. [CA],"I'm in my second year of undergrad at a state university in Florida and I'm having an issue with my brother, who in his late twenties and a computer engineer (this is relevant to my issue). As a sidenote I know very little about computers other than basic googling skills.

My brother is a very type-A person. Very perfectionist and hardworking, often to the detriment of himself and others. He is a nice and positive person and is successful in the traditional sense, but he is very controlling and has a bit of an overblown ego. I'm a much more relaxed person and the two of us share very little in the way of interests or guiding philosophies. I'm a visual arts major who likes to draw and he's the type of person who watched Fight Club and thought that Tyler Durden was onto something. We get along but have hostilities.

My brother resents the fact that I am not like him and that I don't look up to him as a role-model. He is very fond of mocking my interests/hobbies/career plans and he often talks literally about a ""plan"" for me in which I change my major to engineering and start taking his advice. When he brings this up now over the phone I stop talking to him for whatever amount of days/weeks until he apologizes and we do it all over again.

Two weeks ago, my brother made a joke referencing a piece of digital art I drew on my laptop. I didn't think anything of it until I realized after the call ended that I never posted that piece of art anywhere, not even onto any cloud service-- it had only been available on my physical laptop.

I was nervous and downloaded Malwarebytes but it didn't find anything. Thinking back I also recalled my brother making a joke about something I said to a friend privately on my Discord, which also was not publicly available. Checking Gmail and a few other websites I'm on that showed options I discovered someone had been logging into my accounts from an unfamiliar computer and had then been doing so for about a week.

I called my brother about this and he laughed and told me that he had remote access to my computer and that he'd be ""checking"" up on everything I was doing from this point on. I told him that that was ridiculous and he basically laughed and said that people today have no reasonable expectation of privacy anyway. 

Without going into detail I've basically discovered that my brother literally has access to everything in my life. My bank account, school account, my art/chat accounts, all the files on my computer. He has even referenced information that leads me to think there is a very good chance of him having a camera/microphone in my room (he has been in my apartment in the last month and the only reason I think he might not is because I haven't been able to find it.) 

There is nothing on my computer or Cloud files or anything I'm even remotely embarrassed about. But the idea that my brother has all my information is terrible and I want him to stop. I don't feel comfortable in my apartment or using my computer/personal accounts anymore. I'm writing this from my school's library.

Is there a way to clearly show him that this is wrong with an amount of force and guarantee my privacy in the future WITHOUT getting him in serious trouble? My brother is an idiot and I'm pissed at him for this (especially in the way where he acts like it's a joke or that he's doing it to ""mentor"" me, which he keeps saying, like he has called me knowing my class schedule which I never told him and reminded me to go to classes/etc) but I don't want his life should be ruined over this even if he is an asshole. He has also ""joked"" about dropping my classes which I got really pissed at and he assured me it was a joke but I still feel uncomfortable that he'd even hint at that.

cherrywell,2018-08-28 12:43:46+00:00,Being taken to court to “amend P.O.” by stalker - what can I do to bolster my case?,"Hello all-

This weekend I received a certified letter from TN (where I have just received order of protection.) The letter was a summons for a petition to “amend” an order of protection — my stalker wants it cancelled because at trial he stated “no findings” and when asked to explain he said “no contest” and the judge asked directly “do you mean you agree we should award her the order of protection?” to which he replied yes. She struck the gavel and we left. 

In the summons where I am now defendant the guy claims I lied in my initial report, that he didn’t understand what the judge had asked, and I had no reason to fear my life or safety. 

I made several specific claims of threat he had made of which I have text screen shots of each or photographs of evidence. I also have “witnesses” who  have seen the interactions first hand. But I am not sure if he’s got some weird legal plan I don’t understand that could argue against them. 

Can I also use the court recording of him saying he agreed as evidence? And how would I obtain it? 

I went prepared to fight my case last time and now I’m losing work time to keep taking off to go fight this battle (it’s about 5 hours away to the court in question.) in any case even working as much as I am I cannot afford a lawyer and I am frankly terrified to go in and defend myself. Even last time I was sobbing and shaking at my podium before the judge and I am not sure I can keep my composure again this time. 

Is there any legal resource available to me? Am I entitled to a lawyer as a defendant, and how do I get one? I’ve contacted legal aid society both times and got declined for assistance last time. Not sure if they will do so this time. 

Other than that what can I do to make sure I do not lose this case? What is best evidence? Is there any further restrictions or punishment I can get him? He accuses me of perjury and now I’ll have lost almost 4 days work at a new job. 

This is a saga of almost 6-7 years of abuse followed by stalking and I am prepared to do anything I can to make it stop. Thank you for reading...",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9ayl0g/being_taken_to_court_to_amend_po_by_stalker_what/,legaladvice,1143,70,0.0
JMSOG1,2018-08-28 00:33:37+00:00,The Post Office is refusing so much mail that my town is on the verge of revolution,"Long story. A lot of this is from secondhand sources, since I don't interact with the community all that much, but sources that I trust completely to be accurate and without hyperbole. Also, leaving out specifics of where this is since this is a town-wide issue. I also apologize if my writing is confusing.

&amp;#x200B;

I live in a town of less than 1000 people, and work receiving for a small shop there. The town recently got a new postmaster, and the moment that that happened, the post office started refusing mail at the smallest technicality. In our shop's case, our actual address is listed on a lot of our incoming product instead of our PO box number, which causes the post office to refuse it. Even after we got some of our accounts to change their address, the mail still gets refused if the PO box is not listed in a very precise, specific way.

&amp;#x200B;

What this has led to, in our specific case, has sucked for business. We've had a large amount of stuff that we needed to sell at a specific date getting refused, and it gets refused even 2-3 more times over the course of weeks until it finally gets to us. We've had customers try to return stuff to us and failing because, again, the address is not 100% correct. Our business is fine, but the impact is noticeable. It's worth noting, too, that they KNOW it's for us...Every time I walk into the post office to deliver something on the business's behalf, they recognize me, and reference the place I work by name. They know us. This means that they received mail, had it IN THE BUILDING, knew it was FOR US, and still went through the effort of sending it back. This has only been a thing since the new postmaster was hired.

&amp;#x200B;

It turns out, too, that this has been happening to all the shops in the area to the same degree, and everyone is just is just as frustrated. This is speculation on my part: My shop is not seasonal, but a significant amount of the other shops are. It sucks for us, but for the other stores that lose the ability to sell their stuff during their on season, it must be disastrous. The post office refusing so much mail is having a noticeable effect on the economy of the town.

&amp;#x200B;

I discovered it was even worse today. I, for some reason, believe that this was only happening to businesses. It turns out the post office has been refusing the mail of EVERYBODY. This is especially bad since the majority of the people who live here are retirement age. I was told that there have been multiple cases of people having bills of all sorts arriving late, or not at all, leading to them having to pay interest on the late bills, or having services shut off. Since the number of medical bills that the members of a town of people in their 70s are 80s would have, this has apparently led to a lot of people having to late fees so large that they have ruined their lives in a handful of cases.

&amp;#x200B;

I was told about this today, and when I went to the post office an hour later, there was a woman in her 80s begging the postmaster to stop refusing her mail. It was heartbreaking.

&amp;#x200B;

I get that being very precise and following the rules precisely is a good thing, and I get that mail can occasionally be refused. But this is ridiculous. This is epidemic. When half the town is in an uproar over not getting their mail, it stops being our fault. This has only been an issue since we got a new postmaster, so I KNOW it doesn't need to be this way.

sdchibi,2018-08-27 17:58:12+00:00,"[Update] I allowed my sister to move in with me, dad tried to say I kidnapped her to avoid child support (CT to NY)","Update of my previous post:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/91hftj/i\_allowed\_my\_17\_year\_old\_sister\_to\_move\_in\_with/](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/91hftj/i_allowed_my_17_year_old_sister_to_move_in_with/)

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: I didn't get in trouble for taking in my little sister and a court order for child support was issued.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I had my day in court today for the child support hearing. Dad actually showed up for court instead of using the option of conference call like my mother did. My sister (let's call her Valerie) wanted to sit in the courtroom in case the judge had any questions for her in particular (he didn't, but I'm proud of how brave my sister is for going to court when she didn't have to) because I could feel my heart beating in my throat the entire time. 

The judge started out by saying he was unsure if a support order could be issued today given that Valerie is now 18 and in CT would be ineligible but in NY would be eligible until 21 but then began asking some some questions.

Dad did a lot of talking at first, mostly saying how he had a court order that gave him full custody of Valerie and that Mom was supposed to be paying him child support.  Then he said how Valerie dropped out of high school and left the state to live with me without telling him or getting his permission and how he didn't know for a month after the fact. he complained that Mom never speaks to him about anything, that I make no effort to have a relationship with him and that Valerie doesn't either. Boo-hoo, we're all ganging up on him and he doesn't know what he did to deserve it, etc.  Sure enough, as a few of you kind folks mentioned, the judge asked him ""Why didn't you know where she was for a month if she was supposed to be in your custody?"" 

He then says that she was staying with her mother at the time but that she would've had a place with him and still does have a place with him if she had asked. At that point, sick of hearing him play the victim, I piped up and asked as calmly as I could manage ""Why didn't she have a place with you 9 years ago when you dropped her off at Mom's house, didn't tell her you weren't coming back for her and then got rid of all her belongings?"" 

My mother on the phone confirmed what happened and said that she asked me if I could take in my sister because of my brother's violent behavior early in 2017. Valerie was 17 at the time she moved to NYS and is still attending high school to earn her diploma (better late than never) and I've been her sole source of support ever since. 

The judge then reviewed the guidelines for monetary support. My mother, being disabled and on social security, was to pay no more than $50 per month for support. Dad was to pay no more than 17% of his income, which translated to to roughly $800 per month. The judge asked me what amount I was looking for. My answer was that I just wanted some help with the groceries and her medical bills so I asked for a total of $250 from Dad and the max $50 from Mom. Dad tried to haggle me down to $200 per month because he just bought a house last year (you should've seen the look on the judge's face). The judge reminded him that the guidelines recommended $800 a month and I held firm on $250. Dad sighed and said he'll have to give up smoking to afford it (this is supposed to make me feel bad?). 

The judge made the order for support, effective until age 21 AND I never did get in trouble for allegedly ""kidnapping"" my little sister.

Thank you to everyone here that gave me encouragement to see this through and not fall for Dad's intimidation tactics.

Waywaywen,2018-08-27 15:56:12+00:00,Is it legal to send a thank you of value to a police officer who went above and beyond in Arkansas. Not a bribe.,"My child has epilepsy and he had a seizure while I was driving. I pulled off and over on a fairly busy road (not an exit available) to administer aid and diastat acudial as directed in his plan of action. 

I had to wait until the seizure hit over 5 minutes and as I waited an officer pulled up. I told him what was happening and at the 5 minute mark he helped me administer the diastat. He called for EMS and we were escorted by EMS to the hospital. 

I was worried about leaving my car on the side if the road. I was worried about it being towed. Seems like a trivial thing to worry about but tows can get expensive and I knew due to the location of the car that it would have to be towed. We were far from home. 

The officer assured me that it would be fine. He took down my number. I thanked him and we went to the hospital. I handed him my keys. 

My child is fine! Seizures are semi new to us and  they are always scary but I was told it may happen and was prepared as I could be. 

We were at the hospital for about 5 hours when the officer stopped in. He handed me my keys and told me the car was parked out in the visitors parking and where. He also brought a small gift bag (small toys and a candy) for my child who was feeling much better and me a water and a sandwich from the downstairs cafe.

He talked to us for a while. His brother had epilepsy growing up.  He gave me his number and said I could call if I needed. 

He went way above and beyond and I'd like to send him a card with maybe a starbucks or equivalent coffee shop gift card. Nothing big maybe $20. But I wasn't sure if that would run afoul of any laws. I could also do some baked goods to the ""station"" instead or something if gift cards are illegal and ethically questionable. But can they even accept that? 

I know bribing is illegal but can you thank officers with gifts? 

I don't know if this is a like a typical thing police do that doesn't require more than a thank you or if this is like above and beyond and requires a formal thank you if legal. 

I am assuming he had to use his personal nonwork time to bring my car to me. And I have also considered the possibility he wasn't suppose to do this and instead did because he is nice and I don't want to get him in trouble.

FrostedToasties,2018-08-26 06:31:38+00:00,A houseguest didn’t inform us he conceal carried and my toddler got his gun and shot it at her sister,"(Indiana) My wife’s cousin’s daughter comes through town once a year for work, and we usually let her stay with us (myself, my wife, our kids 2&amp;5) on our pullout couch. 

Between this year and last she got engaged to someone in her company, so she asked if she could bring her fiancé (let’s call him Brent) to stay the night with us as well. We told her that was fine. At no point did she mention Brent conceal carried a firearm, or ask us if it was okay to bring into our house.  

So they were planning on staying Thursday through the end of the weekend, a total of four nights. 

The first day was fine, everyone got along, Brent, my cousin, and the kids had fun together. 

Friday evening Brent drifted off on the (folded up, normal shaped, non-bed) couch. My two year old loves to climb on the back of the couch, I went to pull her down because Brent was asleep, but he woke up briefly and assured me it was fine. 

Fifteen minutes later I stepped into the yard to take a phone call and my wife was in the restroom. My two year old  somehow got the gun from Brent’s person and fired it. (How secure could it have been on him if my kid could get it so fast, and without waking him?) 

Thankfully, no one was hurt. The bullet pierced the ground *inches* away from where my older daughter was playing. My two year old dropped the gun in shock. 

I’m so grateful it wasn’t anything worse, I’m also irate that this man brought a gun around my children without informing me. Is it legal to conceal carry on someone’s personal property without their consent? And are there standards for how you wear the gun so it can’t be taken so easily by kids or criminals or whoever else might want to get at it? 

I asked them to leave at that point, and they wrote saying I should comp them for the hotel they had to book. No offer to repair the damage to our floor, or apology from Brent about allowing his gun to get into the hands of a two year old. His wife seemed apologetic, not to the magnitude we’d hoped...about to the degree of someone who spilled grape juice on the carpet. 
But we’re reevaluating how sorry she actually was, because she sent the email saying we should comp their hotel rooms. 

I don’t even really care about the damage to the floor, I just want to know if there could be legal ramifications for his failing to inform us he’s brought a firearm into the home and therefore knowingly endangering my kids. 

Thanks in advance for the advice. 

*tl;dr a distant relative and her fiancé “Brent” were staying the weekend with us and our toddler children, and Brent did not inform us he conceal carried. He fell asleep on the couch and my daughter got his gun and fired it inches away from her sister (no one was harmed, thank God). 

No real apology, and after I said we’d prefer they stayed somewhere else, they wrote asking us to comp their hotel rooms. Can I take action against Brent for not informing us he was bringing a gun on our private property and not taking proper precautions with it around my kids?*",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9adn9n/a_houseguest_didnt_inform_us_he_conceal_carried/,legaladvice,1660,175,0.0

&amp;#x200B;

I'd like to take a minute to say thank you to everyone who responded to my last post. Your advice helped prepare me for what came next.

&amp;#x200B;

Pretty soon after I posted, I received a letter in the mail from a lawyer that basically said that my parents were demanding a paternity test on the basis of grandparents rights. I knew from my post that it was unlikely that a lawyer would take this case, so I googled the law firm and lawyer's name. I couldn't find the lawyer's name anywhere, but the law firm was real so I reached out to them. The letter was fake and the law firm was not happy. They asked for the letter and are pursuing some sort of legal action against my parents. I don't know exactly what's happening as I have not been in contact with my parents in a while.

&amp;#x200B;

In other news, my daughter was recently diagnosed with a (very minor) skin condition that is fairly uncommon and that I also have, which means she's most likely mine after all. We still won't be doing a paternity test any time soon, but it was helpful for our peace of mind.

I work at a company that happens to employ a lot of transgender people. I am born male, I dress masculine, and go by he/him.

allthethings13,2018-08-24 05:32:58+00:00,School won’t allow my son to carry his EpiPens,"My 3 year old son has a peanut allergy and recently started preschool at a public elementary school in our local school district. I let the teacher know about his allergy during orientation and that I was planning on sending an EpiPen in his backpack every day. 

When school started the following week, teacher informed me that she had been told my son would not be allowed to “self carry” the EpiPen in his backpack due to his young age.  The district’s written policy allows students to self carry and even self administer life saving medications (EpiPens, insulin, inhalers were all specifically mentioned) by submitting a consent form signed by their parent and doctor, with no age specifications. 

I have completed and submitted this form but the school still wants to keep the EpiPens in the front office....several buildings away from his classroom....locked in a box....and only select staff members have keys. Young kids are notoriously terrible at recognizing and reporting their symptoms quickly; the time it could take for the teacher to notice a problem and get the EpiPen from the office could be fatal. 

I’m willing to compromise and have the EpiPen kept in a secure but obvious location in the classroom rather the backpack but the teacher isn’t willing without the school’s blessing.  What are my options here?  Do they have the legal right to establish an age restriction in this situation?  I

We went over our rent agreement and looked at all the paperwork that we received.  We ended up talking to other tenants and finding out that the manager has been acting rather paranoid and seems to be hearing voices. She also tries to bully other people into doing what she wants.

 Upon learning that, we decided to talk with the home office of the complex. The staff there were very kind and professional. When they heard who are complaint was about, the smile faded from their face. We gave them a typed statement of our side of the events and put in their files that we complied. We are no longer being evicted and they said they will discuss the incident again with the manager. Even if the manager doesn't change her tune, we've proven that we will stand up to her.

My ex broke up with me a few months ago because I was laid off from my last job and was upset because I moved on relatively quickly.

I found a new job that I love (we both work in tech) in the meantime. I put it on LinkedIn a few weeks ago and I haven’t blocked him there although we aren’t connected. My profile is public. 

A few days ago an email was sent to everyone I work with (a staff of around 60 people) containing images of me sleeping and naked. One of the pictures showed just my vagina. 

I left without talking to anyone and had an emergency meeting with my therapist. 

The pictures were taken in his bed and without my permission. 

During my meeting with my therapist I received calls from my coworkers, and a text from my ex saying that he received the pictures of me and that he did not send the out. He admits that he took them when we were together and never told me, but claims he was hacked by someone he doesn’t know. 

Obviously he’s lying. 

I’ve gone back to work and most (not all) of the men have changed their attitudes towards me. Like avoiding me, not saying hi like they usually did, laughing when I enter the room, etc.  It hurts. The women are comforting and telling me I’ll get through this. 

I am in mental anguish and I am fortunate that my boss hasn’t fired me. She said there’s no way she would do that, but that for now I should make my LinkedIn private. She also says I should go to the police.

Cat_Beans,2018-08-21 20:36:42+00:00,Update 6 - Washington State: Neighbor is currently video recording me and has a camera directly pointed at my bedroom window. What can I do? [It continues],"So my neighbor decided to throw up some nice floodlights pointed over his fence right at our bedroom window right after his court date.  In that time we have sold the home and moved to an apartment in transition to our new destination, far far away.

He turned on the floodlights every night at 10pm and they would clearly shine through the bedroom window even with the black out film, and really shone through our guest bedroom where my mom stayed for a week to visit. Police came out and took pics and drove by several nights to confirm they were still up.  Part of his plea deal is to not commit ""similar incidences"" and further harass us. This comes into play later.

I called the police and they ended up serving me papers saying I was required to be a witness in court.  Court day came, they were asking for jail time, and my neighbor's attorney asked for a continuance because he didn't have time to review the new info.

They granted it.

Second week comes around, we rescheduled for a special hearing with a pro tem judge.  Mistake.

Today was the hearing and the second time we all had to take off work to show up.  The judge immediately told the city prosecutor since she didn't have a formal briefing, that he was not familiar with the case and that it would not be heard today.  Typically the judge who does hear the city's cases is well informed and the prosecutor objected to this saying it is not a requirement, you knew what was on the docket today. The judge further mentioned that because specific charges were not filed and they were just asking for jail time given back onto the jail time they waived at the previous hearing, he wasn't interested in doing this today.  Then he mentioned he had court in Seattle in two hours and wasn't interested in hearing my testimony today.  Also, since we will be gone by October, he didn't see the issue in why we were even there - since we moved, we can't be harassed anymore so problem solved.

I broke down in tears of sheer frustration.  The prosecutor said I don't have to be a witness anymore and they would talk to the usual judge in the case.  And to keep in touch with her. When my neighbor walked out, he did a very dramatic prayer hands in the air, like he knew he won.  I give up again. We're leaving, it's over, I will never get my day in court. I will never know what I did to this man to make him harass me so deeply.  I will never get two years of my life back.

MetroDZS,2018-08-20 17:34:08+00:00,[Update] [Maryland] Taken By EMTs Against My Will,"[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7iq9fh/maryland_taken_by_emts_against_my_will)

For those of you who may remember me from a while back, and those who read my original post just now, you're probably wondering why I'm bothering to post this update in the first place. I'll get into that later, but the short answer is that I believe the responses I received to (and the subsequent consequences of) my original post here played an important role in causing me to do a serious amount of self-reflection which resulted in me making serious, positive changes to my life. I suppose you could even call this update a thank-you of sorts. Anyways, on to what actually happened after my original post 8 months ago.

As my edit to the original post implied, I did not get what I wanted from my original post. What I wanted was a bunch of people to tell me what I wanted to hear, and to provide an escape from the consequences of my own reckless behavior. What I got was a whole lot of people reminding me that there was no one to blame but myself, and that I had to now face the consequences of my actions. Naturally, I refused to accept this, and went ahead and ""consulted"" a lawyer. I say consulted for the lack of a better word, as it was more like said lawyer showed me the door shortly after I pleaded my case. 

This, however, did not deter me. If anything, it only invigorated me further. I decided on pro se representation. The first step was, of course, collecting evidence. And by ""collecting evidence"" I of course mean showing up to the fire station that housed the ambulance that picked me up drunk and demand the information I wanted. Luckily, this was at approximately 3am, and only one firefighter was awake at the station at the time.

I suppose I should count myself extremely lucky as he did not immediately call the cops on me, but instead sat there patiently and listened to me as I screamed unintelligible nonsense at him. Even offered to give me a ride home using the departments utility truck. Needless to say, I did not acquire the information I sought out, so I returned home and passed out. 

When I woke up, I woke up to a shit storm. The original post I had made here had apparently been cross-posted to another subreddit, which somehow led to me being doxxed and humiliated by almost everyone who knew me. Even my boss laughed at me. Suppose I should be grateful that I wasn't fired. 

In any event, the humiliation led to me taking a step back and looking into my life with an outside perspective. I hated what I saw. I hated it so much that I swore to myself that I would change. And somehow, I did. Sort of. I never actually ended up filing anything with any sort of court. Good thing too. Would only have served to waste my money and humiliated me further.

I came to the conclusion that I was a functioning alcoholic. A few months ago I began to try the AA route. It was hard, and I released a few times, but as of posting this update, I am over a month clean. I don't really want to get into the details of my recovery, but needless to say the slap in the face I got from the doxxing of the post I originally made here really helped out. 

I won't bore you guys with the details of how I proceeded to clean up my life after that, but I consider myself I seriously different person than I was 8 months ago. And it's all due to a chain of events that was borne from the original post I made to this subreddit, and for that, I'd like to thank you guys.

I suppose I don't have a single reason for actually posting this update, but I hope you guys know that your advice does help people, even if it may not be in the way originally intended.

LogicalDesigner,2018-08-20 13:01:35+00:00,Job offer rescinded after employer learned about my disability. [NY],"I'm a software engineer and last week I received an offer after I completed the interview process. I countered and the hiring manager asked to see me to finalize the negotiations in person.

I lost my index finger at the age of 14 (I am 33 now). I have completely adapted to this and it has no effect on my ability to work. I studied CS in college and have been working as a software engineer for over a decade.

Basically after this hiring manager noticed my finger, he said the offer is off and quoted that they're looking for someone who is physically able to perform the job. So we didn't even attempt to negotiate and I was out of the door in less than 2 minutes.

I'm aware that discrimination against people with disability is illegal but I'm also aware that if a disability disallows someone from doing their job properly then it's fine (you can't be a customer service agent at a call center if you're deaf). I don't know where I'm falling on this spectrum as a finger is technically necessary to type, but I still have 9 and can type as fast as anyone.

Without warning, precedent or any knowledge of who we were. A complete total stranger. She slapped him and gave him the bird.

The trouble began when he went in a second time, and grabbed her chest. At this point, i grabbed his hand, and twisted his wrist, banging it against the seat of a chair. The man retaliated by throwing a punch, which I responded to.
After the end of the violence, the three of us were kicked out of the theater, I had broken his wrist and nose, and he had broken a finger.
Would what I did be considered assault?

TL;DR I am being retaliated against for complaining to HR, I am looking for a new job. 

This isn't exactly a good update. I did not end up going to HR the Monday after my post because I wanted to go to the doctor first. So I went to my regular doctor and explained that I was not allowed to eat my own food, and the food my job provided was not anything I could eat. My doctor brought up something I didn't think about, I also have a kidney disease that requires me to eat semi regularly, so this whole granola bar before work, and granola bars before work and dinner after will not work. I did not disclose this because under the ADA I do not have to disclose unless I require an accommodation. So I got a new doctors note detailing that any fatty foods would cause my gastrointestinal distress, and that I needed to be able to eat my own food during my shift. 

 After the new doctors note I went to HR with my new note. The lady from HR said that she was unaware that there was any such rule at the house. And it was completely against corporate policy. I requested that my name be kept out of whatever conversation had to occur regarding this, but everyone knows it was me, it's been a little under three weeks since I complained, and I have been written up for extremely frivolous things, and I feel like they are trying to get rid of me. I was written up for unprofessional appearance, specifically my really curly hair is too messy for the work place.  I interviewed with my hair natural and pulled half back, which is how I wear it every single day. This is only one of the really stupid reasons I have been written up. I am getting married in January and I was trying to stay at this job until then, but I don't have too much of a choice anymore. I have been looking for a job for about a week, so I hope I find one soon. Thanks for the advice though, at least I know my rights a bit better now.

ImportantWork,2018-08-19 16:10:28+00:00,"[CA/TX] My brother, who I have not seen in 8 years, and who is a minor showed up at my doorstep.","Hello everyone, 
I am a 26[F].  About 8 years ago, when I turned 18, I ran away from my home in rural Texas.  My parents are extremely conservative Christians.  While they were not physically abusive, they did not allow me to go to any college because ""education is not for woman.""  My BF, now husband, sent me money in cash and I got a PO box and ran away.  I have not seen, heard, or talked to them ever since.  Before I left, I told my brother, who was 8 at the time, my BF's landline number and a code word to identify himself (in retrospect I was 18 and immature and I felt cool running away).

Yesterday morning my brother, now 16 showed up at my doorstep.  He paid someone to look up my address on a website when he was in Texas.  The way he ran away is similar to mine.  His ""friend"" (I suspect it is his friend, but he appears to have a crush on him) sent him cash money he then used to buy an airplane ticket.

The reason he gave for running away was that he was gay.  My parents frequently are homophobic.  They also say that gay people should be going to conversion camps.   Although he won't admit it, I suspect my brother may have depression.  At this point I don't know what to do legally.  I suspect that my parents may have filed a missing complaint, but I am not sure.  I haven't received any calls from the police or any visits from them.  So here are some questions.

1) Am I under any legal obligation to contact my parents letting them know where he is?  Is it illegal to not do so?  I have no desire to talk to them.

2) Am I under any legal obligation to tell the police where he is?  Is it illegal to not contact them?

3) I know the chance is almost close to zero of my getting any sort of guardianship of him, but does planning to send a child to a conversion camp that has led to the suicides of my brother's two friends constitute child abuse?  Does it constitute child abuse in California?  Does it constitute child abuse in Texas?

4) In the most negative scenario, under which my brother is forced to return to Texas and then forced to go to a conversion camp, what can he do to protect himself physically and mentally?

Really sucks for me because I'm expected to follow in his footsteps and always fall short.

This teacher was warning us of the dangers of smoking pot and basically went on to describe everything my brother did during school, even mentioned his first name, then said his mistake in life was smoking pot and having sex before marriage which led him down the path of debauchery and self-destruction. Teacher said he finally committed suicide last year and he was present at the funeral, wishing he'd done something!

Aaand my brother is alive and well. Talked to him just 2 hours ago. He never smoked pot, never had drug addiction and most importantly never committed suicide! I stayed in class to tell the teacher that he was mistaken but he said ""who are you to question me? You think you know better than me?"" (Well I really do! He's my freaking brother)

Vice principal said I can't prove that he was speaking about my brother, it's possible he was speaking about someone else. This is such nonsense, the teacher was so detailed and he even dropped his first name once. It's more than obvious he was talking about my brother.

Previous follow up post here - https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/83xbg1/pa_update_storm_damaged_house_the_tenants_are_out/

It is done, and my father wanted to let you all know the conclusion of the situation.

House was repaired in a very timely manner and we ended up selling the place. In fact, I was able to convince my dad to sell all his rental properties (9 of them). He's so happy that he did. He's got a sizable nest egg to live off of for many, many years. Mom and dad are going on like a 30 day trip around Europe next year. 

So the tenants ended up suing my dad in small claims for....wait for it...$5,000!!! How about that!

Their son, who apparently is actually in law school and actually passed the LSAT decided ""as a resident of the affected home"" to be the one who did the speaking in the court room to the Judge. This did not go well. 

After a bit of back and forth between my father, the Judge, and the kid, the Judge scolded the son and threatened to call his school for his ""unconscionable, unreasonable, and childish behavior in the court"" if he did not back down. He went on to say something like ""your ill informed understanding of the law and disregard for (my father's) generous offer has put you and your family in a worse off situation...you should know better...etc."" ""(My father) offered you all an opportunity that many, many other land lords would not do, and you squandered that opportunity...shame on you, on and on.""

Needless to say, the Judge was mega pissed!

The 20-something legal scholar's mom was sitting next to him, she was crying after the verbal lashing from the Judge and kept mumbling to her son ""we should have just taken (my father's) offer, he's a good man, why did you do this to us!""

The case was thrown out, and the parents apologized to my father.

Basically, yeah, I have cancer.

While glancing through my hospital records from October, I noticed that the original tumor showed up on a CT scan. It was then noted at least 8 times throughout my charts.

The thing is, nobody ever told me or my family about the tumor and the possibility that it could be cancerous. It even says that a biopsy is needed, but we were told nothing at that time or upon discharge. I only obtained these records a month after leaving the hospital because I was moving out of state and wanted my new doctors to have the records if needed. Well, my new doctors did not need these records as my condition vastly improved, so nobody knew the tumor existed since October!

Since then, the tumor has doubled in size, and there are at least 2, possibly 3. I am going to have surgery and radiation, but we don’t know if we have caught it early enough to not spread.

Today was the first day of the new school year. Last year, the young man that attacked my daughter was removed from the school and did not return. This year, he was back on campus, and not only that, was in a class with her. He immediately was removed from the room when my daughter arrived. But the fact that he was back in the school upset her enough that we had to check her out of school and bring her home. 

We asked the director of high schools at the school board office what options we had - he said he didn't want to let her transfer because 'she wanted to be there and didn't want to punish her' and asked us to keep her out of school until he could investigate. 

She's feeling a major violation of trust and no longer safe at her school. My husband is using his PTO time to try to get her taken care of, but it seems that a transfer is out of the question. The school let us down in her protection.

megm2516,2018-08-12 00:56:11+00:00,Posted tickets on stubhub and deleted them the day of the show when they didn't sell. They sold them anyway and want me to pay 1300+ in fees.,"(Edit: I am from NYC.)

I deleted them and even checked to make sure they were no longer listed, and they weren't. Then they sold the tickets later that day. Whoever bought the phantom tickets couldn't get into the show and reported it to StubHub. Now they're saying I sold bad tickets and want me to pay the value of the tickets plus and extra 700+ in fees. I never received any payment for the tickets to begin with. They said if I send documentation they may waive some fees. I only have a picture on my phone after I deleted them showing there was nothing for sale on my account. I believe their system is glitched and they screwed up.

After reading numerous reviews it turns out they do this all the time. And one person even reported that the person who bought their tickets made photocopies and when the copies were rejected at the show, they reported it to StubHub to make their money back scamming the seller on StubHub. StubHub's response was ""that's the chance you take with secondhand ticket sellers"". Everyone says their customer service screws both buyers and sellers and gives you the run around and leaves you hanging. What do I do?

Update: this was my first and only time selling tickets and using StubHub to sell them. I also listed them on about a dozen other sites and apps but had no issue with any of them.  Please forgive me for not using the proper terminology being as I am not a seasoned ticket hustler. 

The first email I received from them stated I was going to be charged $607 for the price of the tickets and $722 in additional fees which they ""may waive a portion"" of.  Two days later I was charged $722 dollars. After talking to a friend who is a lawyer he told me to shut down my card on file with them but I was literally 2 hours too late and they had already charged me the $722. I work full time and I'm in school full time and couldn't call until the third day. (My schedule is usually 7am to 11pm 6 days a week.)

When I called they said they would reverse the $722 charge but they haven't. I called my bank and I am disputing the charge. They've assigned me a case manager who promised to call me the next day. That was 4 days ago and I've heard nothing. I called yesterday and they said, again, to wait to hear from my case manager. So far all the reviews I've read regarding bad customer service and giving buyers and sellers the""run-around"" are turning out to be true.

My sister's neighbor shot a code enforcement officer dead, set the officer's car on fire, then cut through my sister's chain link fence and set her house on fire with my BIL inside.

The neighbor had been cited before for hoarding / unkept property.  He confronted my sister a week ago in her driveway saying that he knew she had called enforcement officers on him.  She said she hadn't.

Code enforcement came last week.  My sister's neighbor shot the code enforcement officer dead, set the officer's car on fire, then cut through my sister's chain link fence and set her house on fire with my BIL inside.

My BIL was able to escape the house unscathed.  All of their pets were not able to make it out and perished in the fire.  My sister was at work and wasn't hurt in any way.  The inside of the house and basement are gone.  Just a shell left. 

The neighbor was arrested and charge with three felonies.  

My sister's insurance has put them up in a hotel for up to 1 year while everything is sorted out as there are multiple investigations going on.

My questions:

1) My sister does not want to rebuild her house.  Can she take the eventual insurance money (replacement cost I assume) and build / buy somewhere else?  or does she have to rebuild, then sell if she doesn't want to live there?

2) As far as pursuing the neighbor for damages, etc - is that her insurance's job or does she need to contact a lawyer to pursue that?  

3) as a hoarder, I doubt he has any assets other than the home he is in. He also will never see the light of day again. Will she have to sue to force the sell of his assets?

  
I don't know what's happening with the code enforcement's family - i assume they will be pursuing the neighbors assets as well in wrongful death suit.  

I'm thankful my sister and BIL are alive but extremely saddened for the needless killing of the enforcement officer.  She was just doing her job. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/96j127/sisters_neighbor_shot_a_code_enforcement_office/,legaladvice,2191,52,0.0

I clean for private residences in my local area. A year ago, a favorite client of mine's grandson ""Mark"", a 22 year old that lived with my client, accused me of stealing money from their home. $150 to be exact. I was eventually charged with theft, and facing up to 2 years in jail and huge fines!! I have a clean record, and it was his word against mine. So I fought it, and would not accept a plea bargain. For the last year, I've had to report to the court house monthly And sit in the courtroom next to dozens of others and reiterate that I would NOT accept a plea bargain. My public defender would really lay it on thick too. He would say things like, Sure it's awful to plead guilty to something you didnt do, but you know whats worse? Being in jail for something you didnt do. He would pressure me with the what-ifs of standing trial and the verdict is basically a coin flip. I was never so afraid in my life! But in life, you are given opportunities to either fight or surrender.. and even though the sacrifice here was my freedom, the alternative was my dignity. So we finally have a trial date set and about 2 days before I went in to pick my jury, my public defender calls me with news-The Prosecution is dropping the charges and making a motion to NULLIFY!! What?! I damn near fell backwards!! Gone. All that stress, all that needless anxiety..GONE! In hindsight, looking into the matter, many Prosecutors do NOT want to actually go to trial with most cases. They WANT you to plea out so it's over and done with. But I stood my ground, and in my case, it worked out to my advantage. I wish the rest of you the best, thanks for everything, special thanks goes to u/JustNilt for Being so helpful!",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/96elbh/im_a_cleaning_lady_being_accused_of_stealing_in/,legaladvice,8403,3,0.0
ThennyukaT,2018-08-10 17:54:49+00:00,"(Md) I think my dead son's boss might have contributed to his death, but nobody will listen to me","My son was never a good kid, from very young he pushed boundaries with everyone and got really into drugs and alcohol. I'm saying this because it explains a lot.

He first started using heroin when he was 15. According to him he basically got addicted immediately. But when he was 19, after being kicked out of the house, arrested a couple times, he Came to us and finally asked for help. He eventually got clean and stayed clean for a little over a year, was starting to put together a life.

He got his first job at age 20. It was as a busser at a local restaurant. Though he was excited at first, eventually it became clear this was a toxic environment.

One of the owners, who I will call 'Sara' took a particular dislike to my son. She would call him and other busser with a similar backstory (1+ year sober addict) ""the junkies"" to their faces. She would steal shifts from my son because he didn't come in wearing the logoed shirt for the restaurant, but rather a very similar black polo without the logo (this was common practice for other employees, as they were only given one uniform shirt, and nobody seemed to have any issue with that). 

After four months of working there I wake up late one night to find him overdosing on our couch, and he dies. Mind you, he had been clean for a month over a year at this point, and seemed like he was happy with that, so I was in shock.

Anyway, as for my legal question, a month ago (around a month and a half after his death) a women who introduced herself as a manager/bartender at the place he had worked knocked on my door and said she wanted to show me a video. She explained that she had been worried about how 'Sara' treated son for a while, so on the day my son died when Sara started to pick a fight with him she secretly recorded it on her phone.

The video shows Sara drunkenly screaming at my son as he tries to do his job. She is telling him that he is a waste of time and space and should just fucking kill himself. Taunting him and asking him if he is back to sticking a needle into his arm yet so she can fire him. She even takes a swing at him.

Mind you, this is in the middle of dinner service and in front of customers. I strongly suspect this is what triggered his relapse (and what I suspect was more a suicide then a simple relapse). 

My question was if I had any legal recourse against the restaurant based on their treatment of my son. The other manager that gave me the video also said that she could probably find some people who witnessed other similar incidents. 

But the thing is that anyone I bring this up to in my small town just laughs and blows it off. When I brought it to the local lawyer his exact words were, ""Well he was a fucking junkie, you want to sue the only people who were stupid enough to hire him?"" I know that he was seriously mistreated, and worse then that from what the restaurant manager implied it sounds like the restaurant may be knowingly targeting heroin users and/or ex-users, using them for a few months until they either get tired of the bullshit or relapse, and then firing them for a new round of the same.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9697xy/md_i_think_my_dead_sons_boss_might_have/,legaladvice,4687,90,1.0
areraswen,2018-08-10 03:28:16+00:00,Update: small claims against recruiter,"California.

Tl;dr of original post was that I was promised a specific referral amount by a recruiter. I hit my end of the deal and they started dragging their feet. It was over 60 days since I was supposed to receive my bonus and was still getting the run around.

My original post didn't get much attention, but I'll follow up in case someone finds themselves in a similar scenario.

In my last post I had accepted I was going to have to take this recruiter to small claims for my referral bonus. I was told that if they appealed, it would be smarter to walk away since they could then involve lawyers. It sucked to hear, but I needed to know.

I got all my ducks in a row with small claims paperwork, which I found online. Per advice here, I used an app to back up my texts and print them. I also went onto my billing website for my phone and retrieved the phone record showing they had called me over three weeks previously to back up my story.

I then made one final attempt to demand my money from them. I gave a deadline and made it clear I would need to escalate if I didn't have my bonus by then. I also suggested sending the bonus with a signature required so we could track it and ensure it got here ok. (The real reason was that I was worried, after all their previous excuses, that they would claim they mailed it and it just got lost.) I gave them a deadline a week and a half out because I sent the email around a day I knew they'd be out of office. I received no reply until I followed up to remind them the deadline was approaching. I had a tracking number by the end of the day and received my bonus the next day.

If they hadn't replied, I would've first emailed their boss at the company outlining everything and providing a deadline in which I'd be filing in small claims. My hope was that the higher ups would rather pay out the money than waste time in money in court as well as a bad reputation with my company. It never got that far, luckily.

I want to thank those of you who replied. You helped me collect my thoughts and form a plan that made me much more confident in my approach. If I had continued to be timid, they never would have paid me. Thanks again.

Tl;dr: didn't have to go to small claims, but I was fully ready and prepared if needed. Thanks for all the help!",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/963em3/update_small_claims_against_recruiter/,legaladvice,2354,1,0.0

edfreemen,2018-08-08 15:10:58+00:00,[Texas] I Claimed my Nephew who has lived with me since June 2017 as a dependent on my taxes. Brother in law is threatening to report me to the IRS for tax fraud.,"At the end of May in 2017 my brother in law asked me if my niece (11) and nephew (12) could come live with me. They were being evicted from their rent house and their mother, my sister was running around with some questionable folks.

At the time when I met with him he looked like he was in bad shape him self.  So I offered to let all three come stay with me because he said my sister was verbally abusing him.

They moved in and it didn't go so well.  He was lazy and messy and would undermine me and my girlfriend when we could correct the kids behavior.  On top of that he started calling in false police reports on the guy my sister was sleeping with.  A person with a legal history of menacing with a gun.  It wasn't a good fit.  I told him the kids could stay but he had to find other arrangements.  He went back to the house and suffice it to say there was more drama and I helped him get checked in to a mental facility.

As school was coming up I started getting the paperwork together to allow me to put them in school.  Its the Texas Kincare form I think its called.  I got it signed for both kids by their mother and notarized.

About a month after he moved out we started having serious behavior issue with my niece, his biological daughter.  She was threatening to run away and started hitting and messing with my dogs.

He had since gotten a job and had moved in to an apartment so she went to live with him.

My nephew stayed with me and we celebrated his 13th birthday.  We got him set up for school, new cloths, haircut the whole deal.

Throughout the time he was with me I did receive about $100 a month from a payment from his biological dad's disability benefits. but that ended in Jan 2018. I covered the cost of everything else.

The kid thrived with us.  He went from a c student to maintaining a position on the A/B honor roll.  He is helpful and kind.  He takes care of the dogs and has been a great addition to our home.

 Come tax time when it came to if I had a dependent I selected yes.  Per the IRS page he had lived with me more than 6 months so I could claim him.  

When my brother in law found out I had claimed him he said I should have discussed it with him because if he had claimed him he would have gotten $3000 extra on his return since he only made $22,000 in 2017.

He said that he would split it with me and that I would get more if I had let him claim him.  I looked at my taxes and it showed that I was granted a $1,000 tax credit for claiming my nephew.

I told him I had already filed and it was too late and that I think since my nephew was living with me for 7 month he wasn't able to claim him.  

It blew up and there was a lot of shouting and arguing but we settled on that I would give him $500 to make it fair.

My finances are stable but with bringing a new person in on short notice I overspent and had to put some stuff on my credit card. When my return came I used it to clear of the debt I incurred getting the kid set up.  I had to buy furniture, and cloths for him.  These were expenses that I hadn't planned on.  

When it was all said and done I didn't have anything left to give him.

When I told him I didn't have the $500 he said he was going to file an amended return and report me to the IRS for tax fraud.  He is claiming that the weekends my nephew spent at his apartment  in 2017 counts toward the time he was supporting my nephew.

I told him to do what he needs to do but I don't have any money for him.

He has been very hostel through out this whole thing and seems to be more interested in the money rather than the child's well being. 

Doing the math he moved in to his apartment about this time last year.  Even if he stayed with him every weekend it wouldn't add up to a month and he didn't start staying over until after the new year. 

Does my brother in law have a leg to stand on?  If he files the amended return would the IRS come after me?

Was I right in thinking that claiming my nephew was the right thing to do?  I didn't do it for the money.  It was nice having my tax burden reduced by $1,000 but its not like that really changed anything.

I appreciate any advice I can get.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/95muf1/texas_i_claimed_my_nephew_who_has_lived_with_me/,legaladvice,1044,86,0.0

throwaway64ff3,2018-08-06 14:37:56+00:00,Got reported as being a suspicious individual after moving into a new area which led to an investigation after an officer claimed that my documentation is fake. Harassment has ensued - what do I do?,"I’ll try to be as brief as possible and stick to the facts.

I moved into a new area at the end of last month. Specifically, I moved from Chicago to a small town outside of Charlotte, NC. This had been in the pipeline for several months as I was moving closer to be near family. Though I have made this move to be with family, I am living on my own.

I moved into a quiet, residential area. It’s very suburbian, and there are not many solo residents in my age range (24 -39) living here. As a note, I am not African-American or of any other minority - I am a mid 20s white female.

Almost immediately, I met one of my neighbors, who began interrogating me on who I was, why I was there, where I had come from and what I was doing etc. This wasn’t just a polite conversation, they were very clear in the fact that they did not believe that I belonged in the area. They asked me how I intended to pay my rent or mortgage since it did not appear like I had the means to based on the contents of my boxes, and very clearly pronounced that as a part of the local neighborhood watch, if anything were to happen in the near future then I would be their prime suspect. I brushed this all off as madness with a dash of being a jobsworth, and hoped to never hear from this person again.

About a week after I moved in, I received a visit from a local police officer. He said that he had been called because I had supposedly been acting suspiciously around the neighborhood, such as peering into front windows and loitering outside people’s houses. The only time I had spent an extended period of time outside of my house was when I was tending to my front garden. I don’t want to automatically declare that it was the neighbor I’d originally met who had put the call in, but it highly likely that it was them. I invited the officer in to basically say that it was all lies because someone didn’t like the cut of my jib.

An important point to make is that I am originally a British citizen. I came to America 7 years ago initially on a study visa, however quickly decided that I wanted to remain in America permanently. Through sponsorship from my first employer after graduating, I was able to gain my green card 3 years ago. In short, I am allowed to reside in the United States legally. Unsurprisingly, as soon as I started speaking, I was asked to prove my citizenship. I produced all of the relevant documentation, however almost immediately the officer said that he believed it was a forgery. He wouldn’t go into detail about why he believed this, but I was told that what had initially been a cautionary visit to dissuade me from ‘my actions’ had become an investigation into me possessing forged documents. I compiled, mainly more out of shock than anything else, and went with the officer to the local station.

It became apparent very quickly that the officer had no leg to stand on. The first person I spoke to said that everything seemed legitimate, and joked that the officer who had brought me in was somewhat of an ICE-idoliser and was annoyed that the only crimes to happen in the area were petty thefts and the occasional incident of animal rustling. After another interview I was released with all of my documentation, and without any charge.

That happened about two weeks ago. My situation now is that it has become apparent that the police officer who I initially met actually lives in my neighborhood. I first realised this when I was outside the front of my house and he was driving up the road. He pulled over, and said that if he was on-duty he’d arrest me for vandalising public property. I said that I was just in my garden, and he replied that I had no proof that I wasn’t standing somewhere else in the neighborhood and being aggressive, and that he could produce witnesses faster than I could even imagine. 4 - 5 more instances like this have occurred if I have been visible to him in the past two weeks. I know that this must be some kind of police harassment, but currently he has not approached me at all while he has been on duty. Am I still able to somehow report this?",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/951tcb/got_reported_as_being_a_suspicious_individual/,legaladvice,1713,119,0.0

She is a VERY discrete when breastfeeding. But Friday, a woman walked up to her and said ""We are going to let you breastfeed, but you are required to cover up.

My wife - feeding at the moment, asked if the woman if she could ""see anything"". She admitted that she could not, and apologized, saying ""He just told me to come over here and talk to you."" We are assuming this is the male principal.

Later, my wife shared the experience on Facebook and tagged the school in the post. The school untagged themselves.

Today, she received a call from a school administrator saying that the superintendent has spoken with a lawyer and school is not considered a public place and she does not have the right to breastfeed there. She was then told that if she continued to be ""disruptive"" she would be banned from the school.

We are trying to get a definition of what being disruptive is. Breastfeeding without covering up? Tagging them on social media?  We have not been able to reach the superintendent so far. My wife is going to talk to the Principal this morning when she goes to eat with my son, however.

So this public is school not ""Public"" so my wife has no right to breastfeed? If anything, draping a cloth over my wife's shoulder and my child draws more attention!

Lovelybabydoll06,2018-08-06 08:11:44+00:00,Interview Cancelled After Interviewer Sees My Skintone,"This situation took place in Texas. Recently, I got contacted for an interview at an establishment I applied to a few weeks ago. I set up and confirmed the interview with, Linda, the manager. I arrived early and I instantly noticed that everyone there was of a particular race. That isn't uncommon, so I shrugged it off.

Everyone was courteous until I said my name and what I was there for. (My name is typically associated with being white, and I am far from it). Their faces dropped. They looked stunned. I asked for the manager I talked to and she was fetched right away while I was being seated.

After she saw me, she said she had no idea who Linda was. She said she had never heard of her (even though she was linda)! She said the manager had been gone out of town for over a week a now (I had confirmed my interview 3 days prior), and that she wouldn't be back for some time. She had no idea who had sent me the message since no one named Linda works there.

Linda urged me to call back a few weeks from now to see if the position is open and to check if the manager was back. She then said that the manager would call if she thought my services were needed. I never had the interview. I left feeling upset, but just chalked it up as a bad experience that happens to many people. Shortly after I tried calling the number Linda used to text me, but no one answered.

I knew I had been treated unfairly, but that's life. I told a friend what happened, and she said it was illegal. I didn't think it was illegal discrimination since Linda didn't say, ""Oh, we don't hire green people here."" It's obvious they discriminate, but they don't explicitly state it.

My question is: Was this actually against the law?

jessbird,2018-08-05 21:53:36+00:00,Found an abandoned dog while on vacation and had to get it euthanized. Turns out it belonged to my Airbnb host.,"this is really long but i want to make sure i convey the entirety of the situation. tldr at the bottom.

this weekend my boyfriend and i stayed at an airbnb in the desert in **nevada**. the place we stayed at was on a lovely ranch that had a bunch of animals — horses, dogs, rabbits, chickens, etc. the day we arrived the place was ready for us but no one was at the ranch. there were several ranch dogs running around who looked very well-taken care of and were super friendly, despite being stuck outside in the 113 degree heat. 

my boyfriend and i were walking around scoping out the ranch and trying to see if we could find the host or anyone that worked there, petting the dogs, taking some photos/etc. then we saw this other dog walking around slowly. when we got closer we were horrified at his condition — i don’t even know where to start. 

you could see every one of his bones. he looked like a lab/retriever/shepherd mix but his hair was so matted and dreaded i wasn’t sure. he could barely barely walk. he was covered in flies and smelled like a corpse. his eyes were so infected they had sunken in and there were flies in his eyelids. his nose was super rotted/scabbed up and raw, and he was missing half his teeth. i’m pretty sure he was deaf because he only responded to us when we knelt down in front of him. he was covered in sores and open wounds. he was wearing a heavy studded leather collar with no tag, and there was an open wound under the collar from how much it had rubbed into his skin. the pus/blood from the wound had rusted the buckle on the collar so we couldn’t even get it off.

when we found the dog we desperately tried to find someone at the ranch but for some reason no one was there (it was like 5/6pm). we had no cell service so we couldn’t get in touch w our airbnb host and the wifi code they gave us didn’t work. we were positive the dog wasn’t theirs anyway, because there were several other dogs on the property who looked very fat and happy and healthy. 

we got the dog some water and fed him some soft bread. he was ravenous and practically inhaled that water and two more bowls we filled for him. then he collapsed at my feet and legitimately thought he was going to die. we decided to take him to a vet or a shelter  but because we were in the wilderness, the nearest one was an hour away. 

i wrapped him up in a blanket and held him in the backseat while my boyfriend sped to the vet. the car was full of flies. we cranked the AC and he slept the whole way there. we carried him into the vet and they took him back. while i was filling out paperwork, the vet tech came out and told us that his wounds were full of maggots that had gotten so deep into his body it wasn’t possible to save him so they’d have to put him down. 

i knew he was in bad shape but i guess part of me was sure he could be saved. i was fucking heartbroken, and i know he’s not in pain anymore but i was so so sad he was stuck out in the desert without anyone to love him for so long. we named him stevie. 

ANYWAY! we got back to our airbnb, the next morning got breakfast and met the host etc etc. we were chatting and i decided to tell her about the dog in case the owner ever came around looking for him (doubtful). it turns out that the dog belonged to the fucking ranch!! the lady was saying all this insane shit about how the dog just pretends to be really droopy and sad so you’ll give him attention, and he’s just old. she said they’d been thinking about putting him down for the last SIX weeks but they wanted to “let nature take its course.” i was losing my shit but just kept my cool cus i didn’t wanna piss her off considering the delicate situation of me uh, putting her dog down. she seemed very nonplussed about it, but she did say that she’s glad we told her because if the dog had gone missing, “we would have frantically looked all over for the little guy.” ???? how do you care about a dog and also let it become malnourished and infested with maggots and flies? 

and THEN she asked if we were able to recover the collar from the vet (!???&amp;$) and i said no because the collar was rotted into his flesh...

we left the airbnb a little later and then she messaged me via airbnb and asked me for the info and name of the vet we took him to. i gave her the info and called the vet just to give them a heads up that the owners might come asking for the dog. 

so to get to my question — i’m concerned this woman might try to go after me for getting her dog put down (despite the fact that she said they were planning on doing it themselves and that they wanted “nature to take its course”). is this even remotely a possibility or am i just being paranoid? i should have maybe tried harder to get a hold of the host once we got into cell service, but all i had on my mind was getting the dog some medication attention asap. thanks in advance for your help. 

(also RIP stevie, hope you’re painlessly frolicking in pup heaven and someone’s brushing your hair and giving you tummy rubs and snackies. you were a good boy.) 


**tldr: found what we thought was an abandoned dog in near-dead condition on a ranch. took it to the vet, had to be euthanized. turns out he belonged to the ranch owners who said they were just letting “nature take its course” and now they’re asking me for the vet’s info. should i be worried/do they have any grounds to sue me or press charges for my killing their dog?? **",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/94vkbg/found_an_abandoned_dog_while_on_vacation_and_had/,legaladvice,4011,129,0.0

daughterskidthrowawy,2018-08-04 19:18:34+00:00,"[WI] Daughter passed away during childbirth, we don't know who the father is","About 6 months ago my daughter revealed to my wife and I that she was pregnant and a little over a month along. This would be fine, but given that she was 16 we were both furious. We and our daughter had a couple of spats over it but she made two things clear: She was NOT going to abort the baby or put it up for adoption, and she REFUSED to tell us who the father was. The only hints she dropped were that the father was around her age and the sex was consensual. Me and my wife, despite how angry we were decided that we would support our daughter and help her raise the child. Fast forward to two weeks ago and our daughter went into labour early. And as I mentioned in the title, she passed away due to complications.

Unfortunately we STILL don't know who the father is. Our daughter's friends claim that they don't know either or they are hiding something from us. And nobody visited us or the hospital at any time to claim fatherhood. We thought we had a pretty good idea of what was going on in our daughter's life, but I guess not. As I am working full time my wife was in charge of driving her everywhere and she says that she never saw her with any men of any kind. We managed to get into our daughter's phone with the help of one of her friends but there were no clues on any of the social apps she had (and we looked at every single app on her phone to be sure we didn't miss any). We also checked our daughter's laptop, searching through all the browsers she had installed and email provider sites we could think of. There was one email logged in, but still no clues. And none of the files on her laptop helped either. There were no paper letters or messages anywhere in her room, nothing that might indicate that she was sexually active with a partner. 

What is the best approach from a legal standpoint to find the father to my daughter's child? My wife and I have a few ideas of who it could be but don't have substantial evidence to prove anything so we don't want to cause unnecessary drama with other parents or teens. Should we go to the police? Will we need a lawyer? If the 'culprit' is an older man could we press charges? Any help would be appreciated.

When I went in to speak with the state's attorney, I ended up meeting with the assistant state's attorney to review my case. I told him everything that happened and went over the evidence presented. After interviewing one of my witnesses and making a few calls, they sat me down and told me they weren't pressing charges and not taking my case, therefore letting him go. They told me that because HE WAS DRUNK, he did not perceive it as nonconsentual sex and therefore didn't necessarily have the INTENT of raping me despite my actions. They told me that there is nothing they can do unless I provide a smoking gun in the future of him explicitly stating that he had planned on raping me.

I'm honestly heart broken and emotionally shattered from this. My rapist was freed on the count that was drunk.

megadeth37,2018-08-02 19:26:15+00:00,"Bought a purse for my 7yr old daughter from goodwill, she found coke in the bag at school.","Three days ago, My SO took our daughter to goodwill too look around as they usually do when they're bored. I gave her $20 to shop with on the ultimatum that I stay home and play games since it was my day off. When they arrived back home my 7 year-old daughter was ecstatic about this small red leather purse, just her size since she is still really small for an almost 8 year old.

That purse didn't leave her side for 2 days, She actually slept with it on her bed. 

Yesterday at she 2:30, My daughter asked to go to the Boys&amp;Girls club, which she absolutely loves. Being an only child, she gets to play with other kids and do tons of stuff that she can't at home. She obviously takes the purse with her, to show off to her friends. After dropped her off, My so suggested we get a few things from the store to cook for dinner. I agreed, So, we went off to the store we went in the town next over. 

After a successful trip to the store, at around 4:00 we get a call from a police department in the town to the north of us, as that's where the club was located. They have my daughter at the station. We have to come get her, but they wouldn't tell us what happened. 

So after a Nerve wracking 15 minute drive, we get there and they made us sit another 15 minutes before my SO got to see our daughter. They both told the Police the same story about just buying the purse, and we even gave them the receipt for it.

What happened at the school was as follows.

My daughter and her friends were checking out her new purse. She found a small baggy no bigger than a quarter, and turned it into the club head, We'll call him Adam. He knows my daughter up and down and knows us too, because we volunteer and donate at the school regularly. We're always there to pick her up on time, dues always paid, we pay for her field trips in advance. They know us by name, where we work, everything. Vouched for us 100%, But had to follow protocol so they phoned the police. They tested the drugs on sight, and unfortunately, they came back positive. They took my daughter in the police car to the station before calling us, and wouldn't let the club call us to explain.

They drug tested my SO before they would release our daughter to us. Now we have a DCFS Case out on us and I'm just trying to figure out what to do.

PowerOutThrowaway,2018-08-01 17:43:45+00:00,[UPDATE] My apartment hasn't had power for 48 hours and my landlord isn't responding. What are my next steps? [Chicago],"OP: https://old.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8s98a2/chicago_my_apartment_hasnt_had_power_for_48_hours/

TLDR of OP: Power was out to half my apartment for days, with no word from landlord.

Here’s the update! 

The day of my post I filed a complaint with the city and sent my landlord a certified letter explaining the issue and citing Chicago Municipal Code 5-12-110 (thanks, u/Trodamus). It took my landlord another two days to call me back and another four days to get an electrician to the apartment. He was on vacation. It sounded like he had a great time.


Thanks to CMC 5-12-110, my roommate and I were able to withhold an appropriate amount of rent to reflect the reduced use of our apartment. When we mailed him our rent checks I also mailed him that page of the municipal code. It was a little petty but boy did it feel good.


Now that we’ve declined to resign our lease (in two months), he’s claiming that he can show the apartment with as little as 15 minutes notice. He can’t, he has to give at least 48 hours notice (according to 5-12-050). 


I mailed him that part of the municipal code too.


Thanks so much to everyone for their amazing help and advice. You gave me the confidence and backup to stand up to my landlord who had been sneaking a lot of stuff by us! ",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/93r6ph/update_my_apartment_hasnt_had_power_for_48_hours/,legaladvice,4364,2,0.0
Dogthrowaway6565,2018-08-01 15:04:01+00:00,TX - Police shot my service dog claiming it was aggressive.,"I have a service dog that was acquired through charity for my autistic daughter. These dogs normally cost around 15-30k but thanks to the charity, I only paid 3k for it. 

Four months ago police responded to the sounds of screaming at my place. We had just moved and my daughter was still getting used to the place so occasionally she would have an autistic fit.

The police arrived and I explained to them the situation with my daughter while my wife was trying to calm her down. The dog had pushed himself between her hands and was rubbing his face against hers. 

One officer claimed he needed to do a walkthrough while the other one said he needed to speak to everyone in the home and that is when, very quickly, things went wrong. 

The officer said he would need to speak to the girl without the dog so my wife told the dog to go sit on the other side of the room. He did. About a minute later, my daughter starts having another fit and the dog rushes over to do what he was trained to do. The officer mistook the situation told the dog to stay and then shot him twice when he walked forward again. 

I screamed at the officer and was tackled to the ground by his partner and handcuffed. The dog ran off and hid with my daughter chasing after it. She refused to let him go until they got to the vet an hour later.   

I was arrested for assaulting a police officer, resisting arrest, failure to restrain a dangerous animal, assault, domestic abuse, and probably jaywalking. 

It was like they dumped a bunch of charges in a blender and poured it over me to see what would stick. All were dropped within 48 hours. 

My wife drove the dog to the vet and they were had to amputate the front leg, but he pulled through. Thing is though, this is not a service dog anymore. He is no longer performing like he used to, not responding to autistic fits, not responding to basic commands half the time, and generally is acting like a normal dog now. Its about 50/50 on whether or not he acts like a service dog or not. 

The big shocker was the 3rd day home, he did not go outside to use the restroom. This was the first time this dog EVER peed inside. 

I tried speaking to one lawyer about this and he basically told me that he was not willing to touch this case. Said we have no leg to stand on, no pun intended, and that it will be incredibly hard getting any traction out of this. Said the best case scenario is getting back the 3k of our own money that we spent on the dog.  

I dont know what to do here. Is this lawyer correct in that we have no case against the city? Should I see a different lawyer about this issue? ",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/93pqhf/tx_police_shot_my_service_dog_claiming_it_was/,legaladvice,3118,74,5.0

The day before the court case (Monday) CPS had apparently spent a few hours at my aunt's house. The morning of the court case (Tuesday) my sister got a call from CPS saying that my aunt and uncle were no longer seeking to terminate guardianship, they were just going to court to see what options they had available to get the child help. Local news also got involved, they spoke to my uncle who informed them they are no longer pursuing termination. So the news station did not show up to court with my sister.

I told my sister not to believe a word and make sure she was at that courtroom. Lo and behold, Aunt &amp; Uncle were still terminating guardianship. My sister was sat down in a mediation room with 2 CPS workers, where she laid out her case. The first guy was new to the case and was apparently particularly hostile to sister when introduced and during the meeting but by the end of it was apologizing for ""getting off on the wrong foot"". During the meeting they apparently were refusing the paperwork my sister had, so sister used her time to read every complaint from school officials to therapist to parapros out loud for them and pointed out the fact that my Uncle taught the child how to use guns and hunt and allowed him a knife collection after he tried to stab my sister in the back with a knife. The other, had spent those few hours at my aunt's house that prior monday and was apparently furious with my aunt and uncle for lying to them. CPS was adamant that they had no home for him because he was such a danger when my sister again pointed out the fact if he was too dangerous for any foster, how did they believe that she was equipped to handle him? They acquiesced to that. The judge allowed for the termination stating they can't force anyone to take him, but because he was such a danger to the other children in my sisters home, my aunt and uncle apparently agreed to continue housing him until some kind of facility opened up. We do not believe that they will keep him that long, so were not sure what the future holds. Aunt and Uncle are actively avoiding my sister, we don't know why aside from the fact they may be embarrassed that they failed Child and everything my sister predicted would happen, happened.  

My sister is actively looking for a place for him to go but in the 2 years since the last time she tried to get him admitted to the only facility in MI she could find to keep him for longer than 10 days, they no longer accepts medicaid unless the child has an addiction. So I suppose aside from all the lying this is the best possible outcome at this time

I manage the day-to-day operations for an outdoor sports/excursion company. We have 26 employees, plus support staff.

Anyway, we’ve always been a progressive company, and we let employees pick which locker room they find most appropriate. One of our employees is a ftm dude, but has said he does not like to use the men’s locker room. None of the ladies had a problem with it, so every thing was cool. 


Now we have a new employee who is also trans, but mtf. She does *not* want the dude in the women’s room, and said it’s offensive and disrespectful. The dude says he is scared to go in the guys room, even though none of our guy employees have given him problems.

He explained that it was an honest mistake and he never meant to steal anything from the woman. The officer seemed to understand (even laughed a little bit), took the phone, and returned it to the woman.

The letter states that if he is found guilty he could face a fine, community service, or even jail time.

https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7mglxj/nc_boyfriends_mom_threatening_to_call_the_cops/

6 months ago I asked for advice on my boyfriend's crazy mom threatening to call the cops on me/have me committed to rehab because of dry patchy skin on my inner elbows that apparently looked like track marks. You guys advised me that she didn't have the power to do anything to me legally, so that was a big relief. To take the pressure and scrutiny off our relationship, my boyfriend and I pretended to break up on social media and my boyfriend told his mom he had dumped me to focus on school. She was pleased, we were seemingly off the hook, and we were able to continue to date fairly easily (her being in another state) albeit somewhat secretively without risking her pulling his tuition out from under him.

I wanted to provide an update since things have come to a very sad and tragic conclusion that no one anticipated. My boyfriend's mom died from an accidental fall last weekend. She was an older woman—late 50's—but we didn't think she was particularly fragile and were both surprised by what sounded like a fairly short fall being fatal.

My boyfriend especially is dealing with some messy and complicated emotions. grieving both the mom he had and the mom he wish he had. I am doing my best to be supportive but I'm struggling a bit to be gutted by the death of someone who was only ever malicious towards me.

Apparently she had a considerable amount of money that she said in her will that she would be giving to her son, my boyfriend. I don't know all of the details yet because I didn't want to pry about finances at a time like this. But it's actually kind of awful because she never did find out we were still together, and I doubt she would have given my boyfriend the money if she knew. So even though I know it's horrible of her to be so manipulative with money I still kind of feel like scum. I am also worried that her will has conditions in it that will make my boyfriend jump through hoops to get anything from the estate, including something stipulating that he won't get anything if he's with me...which I honestly would not be surprised if that was in there, given what I know about her.

So...I don't really know what the future holds at the moment. It's still a shock that this has even happened.

[20]","To start off with, I'm not going to explain why I don't want my mom to have it. That's a different post for a different day in a different subreddit. Also, I'm not really educated on the matter, but I'll tell you as much as I know. 

To summarize, when I was being born the doctor nearly killed me and my mom, and left me with a brain injury and some facial nerve damage. My family sued, and won. They decided the money was my money, but I wasn't even allowed to touch it before my 18th birthday and even then I would only receive so much a month until I'm 30 where they'll give me the remaining amount all at once. Before my 18th birthday, I had to do paperwork: personal info, proof that I am who I am, where the money is going to be deposited, etc. I also had to decide where the money was going if I were to die before all the money was distributed. I wanted to split it and give it to my brother and sisters, but mom said ""no, you're going to put my name down."" Me, being the conditioned and naive teenager I was, did what she said. 

I don't want her to have it. This money isn't pocket change, it's how I afford college and how I plan to stay out of debt, and I don't want her to have a penny of it. How do I change who gets the money? Where do I go and who do I contact? Thanks. 

TLDR: I have more money than I know what to do with, right now it's supposed to go to my mom if I die, wouldn't put it past her to kill me for it, how do I make sure she doesn't get it?

I said I would need interpreter while there and 30 days could be over $25,000 that I would not be able to pay. That I might as well be permanent prison residents while the city have to foot over quarter million dollars a year for over 40 years.

I guess they never considered the expense, they went off to discuss this matter with other staff. They finally decided to cancel the debt on ground it would result in expensive disability debt trap for the city. They said they would bring up at future meetings to have provision added to fee system to not bill people who do not have financial means ti cover any ADA mandated service.

sdchibi,2018-07-24 13:35:59+00:00,"I allowed my 17 year old sister to move in with me (CT to NY), Dad is threatening me with kidnapping charges [NY]","Sorry for the huge post.

Last year (April 2017), my sister (then 17 and living in CT with our mother) dropped out of high school and came to live with me. I live in NY State, Albany area. My mother is disabled by mental illness and in her condition was neglecting my sister and my adult brother that lived there (disabled w/ autism) was physically abusive towards both of them.

According to the custody agreement in my mother and father's divorce (in 2006) it was Dad that was supposed to be the custodial parent and my Mom was supposed to be paying him child support and getting weekend visitation. My sister lived with Dad and his then-girlfriend (now wife) for about 3 years and then sent her to live with Mom.

However, Mom never got the support order changed but worked out an agreement with Dad: she got to keep the SSI money that was my sister's benefit instead of it being forwarded to Dad for support and he kept her on his health insurance.

When my sister came to live with me last year, Mom told me she would send the benefit money on to me for taking care of my sister. She didn't. Dad kept her on his health insurance but refused to pay anything towards her online high school course when asked saying he didn't have any money to spare. So, I'm paying it because she needs a high school education and it's only $50/month.  

This year my sister turned 18 and is almost finished her online high courses,and has started looking for a job but is considering trade school (so proud of her!) She will be staying with me until she can afford to move out; my wife and I have agreed to that and have no problem with that. In NY, child support can be received up to age 21. So, I filed a petition for child support for Mom and for Dad through NY State and the county court here sent out notices to them to appear for a court date.

Dad received his yesterday and called me up, asked me why I was doing this to him, told me I need to drop the case because it's going to ruin him financially and that ""technically what you did was kidnapping"" because nobody asked him permission when my sister was moving from CT to NY to live with me when the court order still says she's supposed to live with him but that he didn't want to go down that route because it's ""low"" but that it's low of me to bring him to court about child support. 

So, my question is: Do I need to worry about being arrested for kidnapping? Would I be better off dropping the child support case?

TLDR: Filed for child support against both parents after taking in my little sister, Dad said to drop the case and he'll overlook the ""kidnapping"". ",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/91hftj/i_allowed_my_17_year_old_sister_to_move_in_with/,legaladvice,1438,66,0.0

6/6/18- initiated, denied


6/9/18- fighting about something unrelated


6/13/18- had sex


6/16/18- she was sick

She blows up, saying that this list I have made is illegal, and she could take legal action against me. She claims that this counts as illegally recording her, despite the fact that it is text, not audio or video. I'm trying to figure out if her argument holds any water.

AlarmedChemistry2,2018-07-23 11:41:40+00:00,[CA] Husband and In-Laws want sole custody of our child?,"I got pregnant recently by my husband. Our marriage had been very happy and drama-free...aside from my in-laws' hatred of me. But anyway, the pregnancy was a surprise because despite taking birth control pills and using condoms, it still happened. My husband began to accuse me of cheating on him, and of purposefully getting pregnant. It was very much unexpected because we always had a lot of trust in each other.

My husband seemed to have been influenced by my in-laws' toxicity. I came home from school to find him gone. My in-laws then began to text me. Mother-in-law began to suggest that I get an abortion, stating my husband wasn't ready to be a father yet. Neither of us have finished college, and we're both working low wage jobs at the moment, for the record. I politely refused, I'd like to keep the baby and raise him/her.

Mother-in-law's texts began to become more aggressive. She then began to make threats, stating she intends to test the baby's DNA and if it belongs to my husband, they will file for sole custody. My in-laws have much more money than I do. 

I guess my question is, how much should I worry about this? Can my husband and his family take custody away from me, even if I have no criminal record or abuse/neglect toward the child? One problem is that I know I should get an attorney but I just can't afford one, I shopped around for one, and they just wouldn't accept payment plans or anything.

I decided today that this was the last straw for me. I have brought up concerns many times, and was basically told to stfu and deal with it. They have been boiling water and using that to clean and wash dishes with. Oh, and once the found out I called they decided to put sanitizer water (that is used for wiping down things in the kitchen) in the bathrooms.

A few other things to put on the list of violations.

-I heard that we hadnt had dish soap for nearly two weeks, and were using the handsoap dispensers instead. 

-There isnt hand soap in the sinks half the time anyways, or paper towels.

-Food is kept out at room temp for hours at a time.

-Our ""cold wells"" on the line dont work, and are filled with ice. Product sits on top of the ice in pans. Often never being changed out during the day. 

-The roof leaks, badly. Whenever it rains, in multiple places in the kitchen buckets are set out to catch the water.

My husband and I went to a popular massage studio last night. My massage girl comes huffing and puffing 15 mins late. Immediately upon walking in the room she’s telling me she needs to leave immediately after her shift because she has some unidenitifed rash/allergic reaction to something? She then tells me she’s not using her forearms or elbows because of this “rash.” I asked if I should reschedule and she said no. She showed me how she was covered in these “bites”- honestly it looked like poison ivy. It looked nothing like bug bites as she claimed.

So during the massage she asks if we can be done early. So my hour massage is now 35 minutes. Whatever, that’s besides the point. This girl then starts talking about getting into a car accident and “hurting her vagina” and her “vagina was so bruised she didn’t even recognize” her own vagina after the accident. Okay. Awkward. Then she takes my hand, while massaging it and makes me feel multiple times some area on her very upper thigh/pubic region. She literally pulled her pants down to make me feel her bare skin. I have NO clue what in the world she made me feel. It was nasty. Not to mention- she’s covered in open sores. 

Later she was telling me I should consider getting my bra resized. (I didn’t even wear my bra during the massage- she never even saw it). She was referring to the red sunburn on my back- thinking it was red from my bra being too tight.

After the massage I wanted to speak to a manager about my experience. I’ve had a lot of massages, but never anything as uncomfortable as this. I think the girl was worried what I was going to say to the two super nice ladies up front because the massage girl refused to leave. Funny how she was in such a hurry to leave, yet she refused to leave until I did. 

I talked to my husband and he told me I should call and at least notify them what happened. The girl I spoke with was shocked. She said they were having problems with her before she even went in to do my massage. She’s going to have a manager call me. 

Can I get in legal trouble for touching her if she tries to turn this around on me? What happens if she did have some contagious rash/open sores and I get it? Am I overreacting about this?  Please help. 

TLDR: massage girl pulled her pants down and made me touch her upper thigh/pubic region. She was also covered in some unidentified rash. Then made several inappropriate sexual in nature comments.

EDIT/UPDATE: manager called me back. I told her everything- she said “my jaw is open and I am speechless” she said there is zero tolerance for this and she will be fired immediately when she comes in for her next shift tomorrow morning. She informed me they received another email complaint about the same therapist very similar story to mine.

My coworker has been harassing me nonstop over the past year over my FMLA. Usually on my day off this person will call or text me at 6:00am to tell me something very petty like “You didn’t put the book back on the bookshelf” or something along those lines. “Have fun doing nothing all day while I break my ass” “Why do you even work here” “You should quit and go move away” “Are you even sick?” 
When I’ve been up all night vomiting causing me to feel anxious because then they go to my boss who then texts me and says “Do we have a problem, why is everyone not getting along?” And then it causes more nausea/vomiting.

My neighbor is so adamant about all of this she's got me a bit worried. 

About a month ago, I moved in with my sister and her boyfriend into a neighborhood that's mostly families. I didn't expect any trouble. My first introduction to this woman, let's call her Karen, was my first week here. I went to check the mail and I wasn't wearing a bra. I had on a baggy t shirt and basketball shorts, though. Karen is one of *those* Southern women who spend all day in their yards, pretending to garden, but are really spying on their neighbors. You know the type. She waved at me and I waved back, trying to be pleasant. She came at me, I thought to make a proper introduction, or whatever, but she started lecturing me about not having on a bra.

It was creepy and weird. I am not at all well endowed, I go without frequently and so far, no one seems to pick up on it, but not Karen. Karen urged me to think of her children and Jesus, who was always watching, and my parents (bless their hearts) she *knows* they raised me better than this. It was so goddamn weird, I felt like laughing in her face, but I didn't want there to be issues so I said I'd be more diligent in the future and Karen went about her business.

Well, wearing a bra wasn't good enough for Karen, y'all, oh no. Not only is blasting my nips lewd, so are regular women's shorts and any form fitting type of bottoms even if they cover my sinful legs. Karen seems to have an issue with the lower half of my body. While my breasts are small and humble, I am ""aesthetic"" from the waist down.

The second time Karen confronted me, her brood was playing in the street and any semblance of pleasantness was gone. She threatened to call the police on me for indecent exposure in front of her children, insinuated I got off on arousing her tween boys, called me a hussy, a Jezebel and that I needed Jesus. Because I was wearing Jean shorts.

We live in a nice area, lots of woods, by lakes and parks and I like to go out for walks, but it seems every time I step foot out of my door, there's fucking Karen making snide remarks, outright threatening to call the police, or gossiping with other bored housewives. It's getting annoying.

MsgWill_SelfDestruct,2018-07-20 13:33:51+00:00,I received a demand letter from a neighbor that is threatening to accuse me of a crime if I do not pay her.,"This sounds like extortion but let me give some background first so you can understand the context. 

Long story short is that my dog escaped my fenced in yard while she was walking in front of it. I have three witnesses who say my dog was friendly and looked like he was playing with her but she called animal control and said she was attacked. Animal control investigated and found she didn't have any injuries and my dog is not dangerous.

I got a demand letter asking for money to cover her costs for medical bills, physical therapy, counseling, time off work, transportation, emotional distress, etc. All together it's over $10k and we have no proof that she even spent any money on any of those things. I've already spoken to my home owners insurance and they are investigating that part so I am not really looking for advice there but it is relevant to the question.  

The part of the demand letter that I am troubled by is she is asking for DNA testing for my dog to prove it is not a wolf and mentions it is illegal to own a wolf in our county which is why she wants me to prove to her it is a dog. My dog is a husky/gsd mix. No wolf in there. But it sounds like she is extorting me by threatening to call the police and report a crime I haven't committed if I don't pay her. Is this extortion?

After this situation was resolved, by paying $220 cash to the towing company, I went to management. They verified with me that anyone may park in the parking lot in the guest parking spots without a need for a sticker or anything.

Second time was with my own car being towed from my rented parking spot when the tag was visible. I was parked in the correct spot and they refused to provide me with a reason to release my car nor to do it freely.

Third time was last night with my significant other's car. This is very much similar to the first one. However, we did report the car stolen this time. I asked the police officer if this was legal for them to just tow whatever car they desired from the parking lot. He said that since the apartment management has a contract with the towing company, then they have power to do as they desire within the means of the contract. I do not have that contract nor know the specifics of it.

So is there anyway for me to retaliate against the towing company for wrongfully towing cars when in designated parking spots?",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/906o8s/cars_are_constantly_towed_from_ny_apartment_lot/,legaladvice,1728,106,0.0

sketchyhapsthrowaway,2018-07-18 19:51:34+00:00,Landlord demanding I pay July rent twice (Oregon),"So first off, disclaimer, I already made an appointment with an irl lawyer for later this week. I just am curious in the mean time what reddit thinks. 

My family has lived in our apartment for 8 years. We always, including this year, sign a 12 month lease. The management is kind of neglectful (grounds covered in blackberries, etc) but the rent is low and the location is great, so we really want to keep living here. Anyhow, we paid our rent for July by handing the check to the complex manager on the 5th. He deposited it and the money was withdrawn from our account on the 10th. His bank then tried to cash it a second time. Obviously, that did not work. I got a message from my bank saying someone tried to overdraft the account, but no additional money came out and I was not charged a fee. We talked to our bank and they confirmed that the check had been cashed, and the other bank had tried to cash it a second time and failed. I thought this was weird, but resolved.

Then the manager said the he got a letter from his bank saying our check was declined. We explained the situation to him and showed him the PDF of the cashed check. He claims he never got the money. Yesterday morning (17th) he posted a 72 hour notice for non-payment of rent on our door. We talked with the branch manager at our bank again. He confirmed for us that the money from our account had been paid to the apartment manager's account on the tenth. He showed us the tracking number the manager can use to find his deposit in his bank.

He absolutely REFUSES to do that. He says that it's an issue with our bank, and we need to fix it, or pay him again, or be evicted.

We have several small children and obviously are stressed out to the max by this even though we can definitively prove that WE PAID and the money was sent to his bank, the check was cashed by him, and we no longer have access to or control over that money.

We are consulting a lawyer later this week but I am wondering if anyone else has dealt with something like this and if you have any ideas on what else we could possibly do? I was planning to sign another lease in September.

Recently, I was at Anthrocon in Pittsburgh and was with some of my friends. I said I wasn't even a furry in passing to them. He was at my table in his fursuit. He sounded pretty angry, but ended up stomping off then. Later that day, I got an email from him saying he was going to sue me for not being a furry but making furry art... for lying to him and for fraud. I brushed that off. A few days later, he also ""exposed"" me on social media and I have gotten a few more messages from people saying they won't be buying art from me anymore. I am a little worried that that will impact my business as well. 

Anywho, I got papers in the mail today that looked legit saying I was going to be sued for the money he spent on my art. What do? Shoud I lawyer up?

I'm a girl and I just finished losing a considerable amount of weight, and I'm receiving attention for the first time in my life and I'm still not really used to dealing with it. I do know that the way I'm being treated now is very screwed up, but I'm not sure how to handle it.

There's a man who started coming in every day, who I've interacted every shift of mine for the last month. He is at least in his mid-twenties and comes in wearing a tail and making furry jokes very often. He is somehow visually impaired and he brings in his service animal to guide him, and he makes sexually charged and inappropriate jokes EVERY time I've interacted with him, regardless of whether I'm make his drink/taking orders/giving drinks. If I'm not at the counter he yells inappropriately. The worst example I can think is him ordering a ""puppachino"" that we offer and letting his dog start to lick it and then holding it back to me. ""For the two favorite b****es in my life"" with a giant smile on his face before licking the top himself. It's usually not nearly that bad but it's pretty similar. He has pulled up inappropriate drawings on his phone and asked if I like doggy style. That specific puppachino incident was two days ago and his behavior continues to get worse. He does not seem to be severely mentally ill with anything and I think he's very aware of how uncomfortable he makes me. 

My manager generally isn't someone who is easy to get along with, and when I approached him with this he essentially handwaved away my complaints and told me that he couldn't do anything and that dealing with this was part of the job. He also explained that he knew about this specific guy because one of my other coworkers already spoke to him on MY behalf without me asking (so I know it's not just me!) but he can't do much because the guy is disabled? I know that that's ridiculous, but I'm not sure where I go with it. It's not like I can really argue back.

The Arborist came out this past Wednesday. Prior to this meeting, and this whole mess, I had taken trees for granted. I simply assumed that you would plant a seed, they would grow, you'd cut them down, make shit, and the process would repeat. But no, I was informed by this mystic man of nature, trees are far more complex. 

They takes years to root. Some trees need more dirt and ground to establish themselves. Some are more valuable in certain areas, with historical roots to the area. Some are incapable of growing in neighborhoods if infrastructure has since been built. And some trees produce different ""veneer quality"" logs. 

White Oak Trees, or *Quercus alba*, is apparently one such tree that is highly sought after for veneer quality logs. They're used for furniture, for banjos here in the South, for all sorts of woodcraft. And, as the magical treeman told me, they're damn tough to grow in neighborhoods. Their roots don't let them grow in neighborhoods, and they shy from urban pollution. His point, is that if you had two white oak trees of veneer quality cut down from your front yard, is that they'd be irreplaceable. New ones could never regrow to that 100 year old size ever again. 

Because of that, Treeman, God of Dollars, stated that $1000 per year, per tree, is a base compensation. 

Sorry for the delay. My lawyer has been smelling blood in the water, and wanted to ensure whatever I posted wouldn't put our $200,000 tree case in jeopardy, and wanted to go over it first.

shivanaHS,2018-07-11 01:50:38+00:00,Update: Turns out dealership employee stole my car after I purchased it.," Ok so quick re-cap. Bought car Saturday night. My salesman refused to let me have it till it was insured. This was at 10pm, one hour after closing. I showed him how my insurance covers the car for 30 days. He still wouldn't let me have it. Odometer at 101 miles.   They're closed Sunday.  I go Monday morning to pick it up. Go through financing (got scammed on btw), pull over to figure out the tech on my new car and see 380 something miles on it.

 \--------------------------- 

 After almost 12 hours and back and forth, it seems they are finally admitting my salesman stole the car from the lot on Sunday, took a trip and brought it back Monday morning.   They ""gave"" me two options. Neither are very generous.

  1) Cancel the deal. 

2) Keep the same deal get a similar focus. 

  I'm going there tomorrow morning. I'm most likely going to cancel and take my business else where, after I cancel the deal I'm considering calling the police and reporting the auto-theft, and then calling Ford and letting them know what happened. Tomorrow, I'm going to let them know that that is what I'll be doing, unless I leave ecstatically happy. 

 What I want:  

.

1) Give me the same black on black Focus SE I have now but the one with paddle shifters (mine now doesn't have it), they also cancel the warranty and bring my payments back to 60 months (what I SIGNED for) instead of 72 months (what they sent to the bank with no signature from me). They then give me the warranty for free.

  2) I'll eat the high payment, and 72 months, keep the warranty. In return they give me a ST (preferred) or  Titanium model.

 If they won't do any of those I'm pressing charges (he's on camera sneaking into the lot and stealing my car when they were closed). I'm also letting their corporate office know what happen, Ford, etc.

throwmeaway45773,2018-07-10 12:54:27+00:00,"[Ontario Canada] Neighbour doesn't want us sitting on our front porch because ""it's an invasion of his privacy"".","Our front porch faces to the north and on nice evenings we like to sit out there in the shade to get some fresh (non-AC) air. The prevailing winds are west to east so we also get a nice breeze. We've been doing this for many years when we are home in the summer.

A little over a week ago, our neighbour from across the street came over and told us we could no longer sit on our front porch because it was an invasion of his family's privacy (????). We have been neighbours for over 12 years and have always been friendly, never had any issues of any kind. At first I thought he was joking so I burst out laughing. This infuriated him and he left yelling and screaming at us. This may or may not matter but we can't even see anything at all other than some of the front of his house. We have bushes, shrubs and a tree that blocks most of our view and he also has the same in front of his house.

Anyway, we thought he was having an off day or something and we ignored it. A few days later, on a really nice evening while we are sitting out there a police cruiser pulls into our driveway. The officer gets out and starts asking all kinds of questions. A little taken aback, I asked specifically what this was about and he informed me that a complaint had been filed against us because we had been looking into our neighbour's house through his windows! We said that's impossible, we haven't left our porch and the only time either one of us had been in his yard was to clear the snow in the winter (which I had done for many years). It's also impossible to see into his windows from ground level in his yard because they are too high off the ground. The officer seemed a little puzzled, asked a few more questions, told us not to go over there and he walked over to my neighbour's house. We eventually went inside before the cruiser left our driveway but since we didn't hear anything further we thought that was the end of it.

Fast forward to this morning. On our way out, my wife noticed a plain white envelop taped to our front door. The envelop contained a letter from a law firm in town which basically said this was a cease and desist letter and we needed to refrain from invading our neighbours privacy (by not sitting on our porch) or we would be taken to court. It also stated he had minors living in his house and our constant intrusions were causing him and them distress, etc..

I'm kind of in shock typing this out. Is anyone aware of privacy laws that would prevent one party from sitting out their porch because that gives them a view of a neighbour's house??

Is it worth consulting an attorney right away or should we wait until he actually takes us to court? We will not stop using our porch no matter what this guy says. We have just now just discussed putting up security cameras at the front of our house but I'm worried this might be an escalation that should be avoided at this point.

I'm thinking about going over there to ask what the h*ll is going on but the police officer told us to stay away so... I think that's not the greatest idea right now.

The last thing that is bothering me is the letter - would any law firm tape a letter in a plain white envelop to someone's door? I would have expected it to be delivered in the mail or registered mail. The other thing that seems odd is our names are not even on the letter.

Thank you to everyone who shared their advice.  I contacted my HOI and the representative laughed at the fact that we were getting sued.  Long story short she said not to worry and they would handle it.  I contacted a few lawyers in my family and they said the neighbors have no bounds to sue since trampolines are apparently illegal in my town.

Turns out the neighbors do not own the house and that they rent it, the owner and landlord of that house was miffed since he is the one that will have to pay the fines for the trampoline.  Turns out that the renters don't have renters insurance (which is why they asked for a cash payment from me). Last I heard was that the landlord gave them a 30 day notice.  As for me?  I'm buying exterior cameras so this doesn't happen anymore.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8x7rf7/update_neighbors_kid_fell_of_trampoline_into_our/,legaladvice,10191,3,0.0
PovaghAllHumans,2018-07-08 13:13:30+00:00,UPDATE: Company cut down trees without my permission,"In the interest of keeping “Tree Week” going, I’ve decided to give a small update to this situation. 

Original post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8j8ml9/tree_service_cut_down_trees_without_my_permission/

I had an arborist come out and do an evaluation. Out of 12 pines on the lot, 7 has been removed and another species of tree had been damaged (broken in half) by the felling of the pines. I won’t say the exact value here, but it was indeed substantial. 

As well, I had a reforestation service come out, that was recommended by the arborist. Unfortunately, due to the steep embankment, it is simply not possible to replant 40ft tall pines. They would never take and it would be nigh impossible to accomplish. The largest that would have the highest success of implantation would be 8-10ft tall, and would take 4-5 years after to regain the privacy from the road and development behind us that we had before. Regardless, it was still an extremely high cost to both replant the new trees as well as clear the debris from the old trees off of the hillside. 

My attorney sent a letter to the tree company with a demand for triple damages as well as the coats of reforestation. I received a deluge of calls and voicemails from the owner, which I ignored and sent VM copies to my attorney. They had a discussion in which the owner is going to turn it over to insurance and let them figure it out. He says we had a verbal contract to do work, which I deny, and I have an unsigned quote and video footage showing I left before he even put the quote in my mailbox. 

I’ll post another update once we hear back from his insurance. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8x1cgi/update_company_cut_down_trees_without_my/,legaladvice,5894,2,0.0
CreepyNeighborGTFO,2018-07-08 04:55:12+00:00,"Neighbor threatening to sue, demanding I take down new curtains","Throwaway being used, though name fitting.

Short story: Recently moved in with my sister who lived alone, put up curtains, letter found taped to my car demanding I take them down or I'll be sued for $15,000.

Long story: I'm 18 and starting college soon, about 2 months ago I moved in to my sister's townhouse, during the move-in process I bought and hung up a bunch of privacy curtains for the back windows and sliding glass door because she just has an itty-bitty back yard with another row of townhouses right behind. Basically, things were in 'full view'.

I didn't notice it at first but the guy who lives behind us has definitely been watching, I've seen him peering over his fence a few times when I was working outside. I've never met him before, or really know anything about him. Mid 50's? Haven't seen anyone else at his place.

So yesterday as I was going out for groceries I noticed an envelope taped to my windshield, with my full name on it. Inside was a hand-written note DEMANDING I take down ""all recent window coverings"" because they violated HOA rules (unspecified) and caused enormous glare (????) into his house. If I don't take them down soon he's going to sue me for ruining his quality of life (???). I know it was creepydude since he signed his name and put his address down.

He included about a dozen pictures of said curtains, mainly the sliding glass door and the window to my sister's en suite bathroom (WTF???), and some of me installing the curtains.

So I know this guy is batshit insane but I think I need to prepare for this insanity to start affecting me. Should I prepare for a stupid lawsuit? Get the police to tell him to fuck off??

Both of my friends were killed in a head-on collision.  There are no children or siblings.  Both have living parents whom I’ve met a few times, but all are out of state and I have no contact information for them and my deceased housemates aren’t on social media.

Is there anything I can legally do to take over utility payments like power/water/gas so service doesn’t get cut off for non-payment… or should I just move out (while preserving my set-aside rent for eventual payment to whomever is entitled to it)?

I want to do the right thing here.  I absolutely want to pay my monthly rent to my friend’s successors, and I’d also like to cover the utility bills until I’ve found a new place to live or until their successors and I reach an arrangement to continue living in the house as a renter.

I'm supposed to check in today and am severely underprepared.","Link to the main post: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6t0rb5/ghana_west_africa_my_university_wants_students_to/

First update: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6t8ri5/update_ghana_west_africa_my_university_wants/


So it's been about ten months since this issue. Although I wasn't able to make any legal impact on the situation, there have been some changes that I thought warranted an update.

The situation really didn't sit well with me so I wrote several complaint letters to the head of the hostel, the dean of my school, and the provost of my college. They were largely ignored or I was given non-committal answers about why that happened to us. I think I wore them down eventually, because they all agreed to meet with me.

Honestly it was very intimidating, having to meet all the heads of my school. There was a lot of pressure on me to back down, because it is unheard of to question superiors like that, especially as a woman. A senior lecturer even advised me personally to do so, or else my career would be over before it started. I nearly did, but I swallowed my fear and went through with it. The meeting was in late May, before we ended that academic year.

I had been gathering anonymous, handwritten opinions about the situation from my classmates and presented them to the panel. I stressed a lot on how I personally struggled with accommodation on such short notice and how the general maintenance of the rooms is the responsibility of the university, as outlines in their rule book.

They told me that painting rooms is only supposed to happen after five years, that the rooms weren't even that dirty to begin with. I had some pictures of some rooms before they were painted (they were originally white but at that point mostly brown with patches of grey, several rooms also had stains from where water had leaked into the room from the roof).

Amazingly, after about two hours of discussion, they decided to stop making students paint rooms by themselves, and are currently amending their policy to paint every year instead of twice a decade. However, they refuse to refund the money we spent painting the rooms, claiming that the painters weren't hired by the university and we the students weren't given receipts so they cannot trust any price we quote.

While I'm not happy about loosing 80 cedis, I'm proud that I've made an impact and stood up. Maybe someone else will have more success.

Thank you for all your help.

mistressofmagnolias,2018-07-06 15:07:55+00:00,[FL]Neighbors/tenants cutting down my magnolia trees w/o consent,"[MS Paint Diagram (since y'all seem to like those)](https://imgur.com/x7wGeKJ)

I inherited this house &amp; surrounding property from my great grandparents when they passed away. This includes two rental properties, which my great-grandfather had been renting out for years to two families. Relations between the three families had always been cordial, even when my great grandparents passed a few years ago and I became the new ""landlord"", though the ""dads"" of both families are only a little younger than my grandfather, and I get the impression from our interactions they chafe a little bit that their new landlord is a woman in her late 20s, but I figured everything is fine because I've never raised the rent beyond what my great-grandfather set it at, and I always have professionals over to deal with any issues on the homes within 24 hours of receiving a call from them.

About three years ago, a local kid was messing around in my magnolia trees, and broke his leg. My homeowner's insurance paid the settlement to the kid's family, but just to be on the safe side I had a surveyor come out and mark the property line for my ""lot"" (they also used the word ""plat"", but I'll be honest, this isn't my area of expertise) vs the lots of the two rental houses, and then had a contractor come out and put a white PVC fence at the property line, just to ward off a repeat incident.

Like some kind of fairy-tale, the kids of the families that rent from me fell in love and have decided to get married. They wanted to have a ""block party"" and the bride's father asked if I'd be okay with them decorating on my property as well, since it's part of the block. I admit, I took ""decorating"" to mean things like hanging lights or other traditional wedding decorations, so I gave my consent.

This morning I woke up to the sound of chainsaws, and went outside to discover the parents of the bride &amp; groom were cutting down my magnolia trees (each tree is about 80 years old - this house was purchased as a wedding present for my great grandmother, and they planted magnolias there when they got married. If my great grandmother had lived she'd be turning 100 next year) because they didn't match the bride's ""aesthetic vision"". 

I told them to stop immediately, I didn't give them permission for that, and I was going to call the police. They stopped, but when I went inside to grab my cell they started up again.

When I confronted them, I was basically told that since they're my tenants, I'd just be suing myself, so I could ""suck it up, buttercup"". I admit, I was more than a little intimidated by a group of men with chainsaws. I went back in my house while they continued cutting and called the police, who came out and told them to stop, and gave them tickets, but they started up again once the police were gone. I called the police again, and they haven't come back out yet. I've also already called an arborist friend of mine (I'm a florist), to come out and do an assessment immediately. I called my insurance company as well, and they're going to have someone call me back. But while I'm waiting, I thought I would ask here: Can I sue them? Or am I, as their landlord, liable for their actions against me? Needless to say, no one is getting their lease renewed, even though they've lived here for decades.

A lot has happened in the past 15 days. I wanted to provide a brief update, but it will be out of order. Thank you for all of the great advice. Sorry I was unable to comment in the original thread, but I am grateful for everything. 

The first thing I did was delete venmo, scan and backup the letters left in my mail box (the ones offering to pay for the trees being cut down, and the one offering 2k), and called for someone from my local town to come and evaluate that the tree stumps were indeed on my land. 

But before the land evaluation, I wanted to write a quick gospel in praise of my lawyer. I drove down to the big city of Nashville, and met with some real mean SOB. I gave him a quick rundown of what happened, and he literally quoted the [helpful comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8svb20/usatn_an_rlegaladvice_wet_dream_neighbor_cut_down/e12n2lg/) made by u/duderos about harming landowners trees. He told me that we should wait to file criminal charges until the stumps were without question on my land. 

So I had a town surveyor visit, and this is where the story gets good. While he was out making his observations, my neighbor!!! came out and wanted to know when I would be taking the payments. I curtly said I wasn't yet ready to accept it, and he got mad, accusing me of being a shitty neighbor and not wanting to help his home. He then insisted that he had the right to cut down the trees, to which the surveyor confirmed my suspicions and told us no, the stumps were actually on my land. He could have trimmed branches if they were too long, but not cut the lumber down. He left in a huff. 

So now I am waiting for Wednesday, when the certified Arborist will visit and tell me the tree value. Thanks again for your help. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8wf44q/update_an_rlegaladvice_wet_dream_neighbor_cut/,legaladvice,2048,1,0.0
throwaway50847,2018-07-05 18:22:10+00:00,[RESOLVED NE] HOA tried to take my land,"So after 6 long months, everything been resolved. This is my final post regarding this, already asked my lawyer if I could post this and he said go ahead. 

So here's my last update:  

https://old.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7go96c/ne_hoa_towed_away_my_car_and_built_a_chainlink/


So the HOA board got a lawyer to respond to my C&amp;D and they requested a meeting ASAP with my lawyer present as well. I didn't want to go but my lawyer suggested me hear them out at atleast. At the meeting, I noticed there president and some of the higher ups were not there. 

The board had no idea what the hell was happening and their lawyer was just as confused as them. After I laid out my timeline of events they thanked me for my time accepted all the financial burden of replenishing my pond, missing car (couldn't locate it), and damages. 

I got checks for everything and got my pond restored back in April and didn't really think much of it. 

I found out a few weeks ago from the new HOA president. Turns out the old president, tresaurer and someone else had been stealing money from the coffers. They wanted my land to expand and put in a pool, clubhouse and etc just as I saw on their website. The old board fined everyone a ton of money to get all the cash together and buy my land. Instead they spent it on themselves. They needed my land somehow so they thought they could just take over the land I wasn't using.


Long story short, their entire plan fell apart after I fought back and brought to the other members of the HOA attention what they were doing. From what I've been told, they had to sell their house to pay back the HOA and have since moved away. The HOA has offered me market value for my land and I do plan on selling since I really don't use the land for anything and the money isn't bad.

I did not file any complaints with the Postal inspector or anything, since the situation resolved itself. I got a new project car and for those asking it was a '98 Supra with a bad engine. My new project is a '67 Fastback that I plan on restoring to look like Elanor. :)

I want to thank a ton of redditors for chiming in with advice including a few from Nebraska.

SouthernCartoonist,2018-07-02 18:10:41+00:00,Update to the family that had been living in my inherited home for 15 years.,"OP here. 

https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8srvbe/tx_adverse_possession_acquired_by_squatter_who/

Simply put the lawyer was able to find out that they had not gone through the steps for adverse possession. They were undocumented immigrants and therefore never did the full process to gain ownership. 

According to the lawyer, this means that the property was never not mine. IT is a good thing I waited till they abandoned the property though as if I tried evicting them then they probably would have obtained ownership. There is still a few things that need to happen before I move into the home though. Paperwork is needing to be filed and such. I did not pay too much attention to it, but he stated that if all goes well I would be able to move in by the end of the month. Technically I could move in now, but that might generate unnecessary LEO interactions. 

In the mean time I have to visibly show ownership of the property as the greedy next door neighbor has been seen on the property taking amateur surveys and generally making it known he wants free property. 

In response I went in, mowed the lawn down with the tractor mower, had a professional crew clean up the dogs, and have started fixing up the outside of the house. I go there every single day now and have been making improvements and fixing things to the property. All recorded on go pro. The lawyer states that the video will likely be useless as that man would have to move in and stay there for 10 years to get it for free. 

He recommended I put up some private property signs around the property. Which I have. 

So all in all a very good outlook for my home. Plan to move in by the end of the month.  ",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8vkupf/update_to_the_family_that_had_been_living_in_my/,legaladvice,2298,3,0.0

Good news, I haw finally received my full judgement amount, interest, court costs, and fees from the property management company. 

I sent them a certified letter demanding payment of the bad check, while threatening another lawsuit for damages. They replied saying they had no record of a check ever being sent to me in the first place and they sent a return demand, asking for payment of ~$400, which they claimed was the amount due after they subtracted the judgement amount. 

That same day, I went to the court and filed for an Examination Hearing. This is a hearing where the defendant is ordered to either pay or appear for the hearing with an explanation of why they haven’t paid and a statement of assets for me to levy from. Failing to appear for the hearing results in a warrant for the defendant’s arrest. 

I sent a strongly-worded letter informing them they could either pay or not pay, but the judge would probably not appreciate them failing to comply. I also explained the issue at trial was the return of my security deposit, not how much I owed them. 

Within an hour of the sheriff serving the order, the property manager called me and asked for a breakdown of the costs and a total amount they owed. I added together every bit and they paid me within 24 hours.

ODoyles_Banana,2018-07-02 05:44:07+00:00,[Update] I take prescription medication for ADHD. Started a new job and drug test collection site released a preliminary result to employer of me failing drug test. Company rescinded job offer despite a clean result from lab. Left old job for new one and now I'm unemployed.,"Link to original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8u3pzg/tnms\_i\_take\_prescription\_medication\_for\_adhd/

I am surprised how quickly this situation was resolved.

I met with an attorney for a consultation Thursday. After talking and explaining my situation, she told me this strikes a nerve and hits very close to home with her because her husband and one of her kids has ADHD. I could tell how furious she was by her expressions and mannerisms. She told me that she would contact the company pro bono, but if it came to a lawsuit, she would take it on contingency as I could get punitive damages. I told her I don't want to sue anyone if I don't have to, I just want this job offer back as I have been waiting a long time for a job like this. She also explained that if her attempts at contacting the company were unsuccessful, I could file an EEOC charge and go through them before filing a lawsuit with her if needed

Ultimately, she told me this is discrimination. Due to an unrelated incident a while back, I have an app on my phone that records all phone calls (one-party consent in my state) and saves them to my Google Drive. I played the calls with my manager to the attorney. When my manager informed me of the preliminary result I explained to her my prescription medication and my ADHD. The attorney told me it was good that I disclosed that at the time because now the company can no longer claim they didn't know about my disability, which would be a defense to discrimination (also this is an office job and my meds and ADHD would not cause any issues in performing my duties). I was not terminated at this time, just ""suspended"" pending the lab test. The call after my lab test came back, my manager said the offer was rescinded and my employment was being terminated due the preliminary result conflicting with the lab result but I would be paid for my one day of work. As far as not being ""honest"" in my interview regarding the drug test, my attorney feels that is just a smoke screen. Any reasonable person would think that question is being asked specifically to illegal substances so essentially we don't waste each other's time if I knew I would fail. I had no obligation to disclose any legally prescribed medications.

I asked about the collection site (apparently the collection site is not directly affiliated with the lab, they just have a contract with the lab to analyze the samples they collect) disclosing the preliminary result and she said she wasn't sure if they did anything illegal because I signed a release before providing my urine sample and this is a separate issue, but she thinks an argument can be made for negligence. She would check up on it because she is not 100&amp;#37; familiar with collection sites releasing preliminary results in lieu of a lab test. She said that if it was a positive test for a substance that had no legitimate medical purpose, then ""maybe"" they would be ok releasing that but even still, dipping some strips in urine is not a certified or accredited test. She said ultimately the point of having a lab test and MRO is to remove all potential variables of a false positive and the point of the MRO is to have someone that is knowledgeable with what can cause a positive result and that can analyze if that positive result is valid or not, to prevent sending false positive results back. If it comes down to a lawsuit, she would name the collection company as part of it, but ultimately this is about the company discriminating.

Anyway, my attorney called me the next day saying she had a conference call with the head of HR and their legal department. When she initially talked to the head of HR, he had been on vacation when all this went down and he had no knowledge of my situation and would look into it and get back to her. He called her back with legal on the line and they decided to re-offer me my job and pay me for all the time missed. My attorney goes on to say they want to have a conference call with me present and if I could come into her office that afternoon. I agreed.

When I was at her office for the conference call, those present on the call were the head of HR, legal department, my manager, my attorney, and myself. Essentially this call was an apology to me. The head of HR profusely apologized for this. He went on to tell me that this decision was made by someone new in HR and despite the head being on vacation, he always makes himself available to his employees and he should have been consulted at the very least. If he had known about this, he would have gone with the lab result and we would never been in this situation. He went on to say that he talked with the rep that decided to rescind my offer, and although he was apologetic, the head of HR felt that the rep did not fully understand the legal position he put the company in and he is no longer employed with the company. They want me to come back in Monday (tomorrow) to continue my employment. He stated that my manager spoke very highly of my qualifications and interview and they “want nothing more than a person with my background on their team.” He even said he would treat me and my manager to lunch Monday.

He told me that they will give me a private office to accommodate my ADHD. I told them that wasn’t necessary as I am perfectly capable of performing my job in a cubicle, like everyone else, but he insisted.

So now I have my job back, getting back pay, have a private office, and being treated to lunch by the head of HR. I owe much thanks to this community for all the advice and support you have given me. I wish I could personally shake hands with all of you. I was so scared before reading your comments.

angrymom1234,2018-07-01 17:24:59+00:00,Being harassed by local mom,"Location: NYC

Last weekend, I brought my twin 3 year olds to a local playground that has sprinklers for the kids to run in. I have 1 boy and 1 girl. Neither likes to keep their clothes on, so I dressed them both in board shorts and t shirts so they would inevitably strip down to just their pants instead of being completely naked (as they would if I put them in 1 pieces.)

I was trying to corral them at the playground but they kept taking their shirts off and eventually I gave up on trying to keep them clothed. One of the other moms saw my daughter topless and freaked out. She screamed at me about child abuse and pedophiles and threatened to call CPS on me. I grabbed my kids and left.

This woman works in the same building as me (different companies) so we see each other a lot. Every time this week, she has threatened to call CPS on me for letting my ""dirty children run around half naked."" (Note: my children weren't dirtier than is normal for kids running around outside and they are always well groomed, so I think she might be referring to the fact that they are mixed race -- she has called my children/husband the n-word before.) 

My question is: Does she have a leg to stand on if she reports to CPS? Will I get in trouble for letting my 3 year old girl go shirtless/is it illegal that I did that? Also, what can I do to get her to leave my children and me alone?

czerwca,2018-07-01 12:46:51+00:00,NY - All elevators broken in 19-story apartment building,"My husband and I live in a 19-story rental building in Manhattan, NYC that is very new - we’re the first tenants to live in our unit, which is on one of the upper floors.

It is a relatively small building with ~7 units per floor, with two elevators serving everyone. One of these elevators has been broken for the past two weeks. The management keeps claiming that a necessary part for the repair is coming “in a week.” While it’s slightly annoying to wait longer for the elevator, it’s been fine. 

However, the other elevator is now malfunctioning. Last night, management shut down this elevator too. People coming home had to walk up to 19 floors to their units. It’s running again today, but the maintenance team expects that it’ll be down again, and they’re not sure for how long.

This wouldn’t be the end of the world except that (1) I am pregnant and (2) we have an old dog who can’t make it up all of those flights of stairs. If both elevators are shut down for any amount of time, we are going to take our dog to doggie daycare, and we might look into an Airbnb, neither of which are cheap in NYC.

If this happens, do we have any legal recourse to ask for a rent reduction or other financial compensation? I know NYC requires that all newish buildings over 5-6 stories have a working elevator, but I’m not sure how it works if the elevator breaks and the management claims (accurately or not) that they’re doing everything in their power to fix it. Thanks!

Stefferoooo,2018-06-30 14:55:07+00:00,Husband being accused of stalking a coworker who wants to remain anonymous - WI,"My husband was called into a meeting by HR and management yesterday at work. He was told that there is a ""young woman"" who works in another department, that has made reports against him. 

Her complaints were the following:

1. There was one instance where he left work after her and followed her to a nearby drug store. He left the store at the same time as she did and wound up taking the same route as her to go back home. She stopped at her child's daycare and he drove past. She claims she took some weird turns to throw him off and he kept following until she got to her daycare.

2. Another instance she saw him driving in the parking lot before work. Supposedly he was tailing her and took too long to park. When she parked, he wound up parking next to her and didn't leave his car until she left hers.

3. The final report, she said he made her feel uneasy. She says she is a very social person and likes to say hi to everyone. She said hello to him once and he didn't make eye contact. She says her ""intuition"" says that he is dangerous.

HR asked my husband several questions, including if he ""liked"" anybody in the office, and what streets he takes when he goes home. He told them that he has only lived in town for less than a year and just moved into a new house on the other side of town. He said he doesnt ""like"" anybody in the office and that hes married.

My husband and I happen to work together in the same department. Our offices are right next to the break room. It's where we go to get coffee, water, and use the bathroom. Both of us rarely see people from other departments in there, and when we do they dont ever really try to start a conversation. We have no idea who could be making these accusations. Most days we carpool except for days when we have conflicting errands. Even then, we tend to come and go at the same time and try to park near eachother.

Since HR won't disclose who made the complaint, it's going to be complicated avoiding this person. (And apparently avoiding them might set them off judging by their reaction to #3.) We live in a small town and work for the biggest employer in the city. It's very easy to run into coworkers.

For now we plan on driving to work together and buddying up for breaks. Is there anything my husband should be doing to cover his basis and protecting himself?",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8v2cru/husband_being_accused_of_stalking_a_coworker_who/,legaladvice,3218,242,0.0

Our mother died last year, and she is left with her father, my stepfather. He has expected her to keep the entire house like an adult and faces extended groundings where she can’t have contact with other family members. What she has told me: he screams at her and calls her names when she doesn’t do something to his standards and makes her stay up extremely late to clean, he tells her false stories about family to make her apprehensive of us, he doesn’t cook for her (she eats freezer meals).
What I know: he doesn’t work, has not gotten her therapeutic help to deal with mom passing, I walked through the house today and there is no covering on the floor (concrete from pulling up carpet), dog piss/shit has soaked into the concrete and dog piss and shit are in her room. The entire house reeks and trash is everywhere. Mold in the toilets and mold on dishes in the sink. She said he does not hit her. 

I’m probably missing things but I’m frazzled. I lived with this guy when I was younger, we got taken away when I was 15 from him beating me and my two other siblings and treating us like slaves.

My life has been just a blurry whirlwind ever since. I’ve already contacted the police (the father is 16) and they’ve declined to arrest him or charge him with anything as in our state there is a close in age clause that my daughter is just a 3 months short of falling under and they’ve assed there was “no real crime”. Which is a whole other thing I plan on pressing with higher authorities. 

What I need to know now is what are *my* options? My daughter absolutely refuses to get an abortion and won’t even discuss adoption. She’s made it clear she fully intends to birth this child and I have no f-ing clue what to do. I myself don’t believe in abortions and I’ve passed my values along to my daughter as well, but I definitely believe that adoption is the only good option in this situation. My marriage will not survive something like this and we absolutely can not afford to take care of another baby. I just can’t. If I could, this would be another story but I can’t make money appear out of thin air. We’re barely making our mortgage and car payment as it is and we’re living paycheck to paycheck. My husband was in an accident at the begging of the year and our savings have been entirely drained. I just can’t imagine my daughter can just force us into poverty and gift us a child against our wishes. 

Is there any way shape or form that my husband and I could compel her to give her baby up for adoption? I know it might sound heartless but can I make her live elsewhere? I just can’t do this. My husband and I work full time and there’s no way either of us could babysit for her. I just don’t see how I’m expected to foot the bill and raise this child and destroy my marriage and livelihood in the process. I know my daughter is 13 and they are selfish by nature sometimes,  but I just can’t believe my daughter would force this on us despite all of my pleas. If I call CPS, what kind of intervention could they provide? I love my daughter very much but I’m at the end of my rope and would even support her through an abortion, or adoption, or whatever, but we cannot and will not raise a baby we had no say in creating.

Pooncahantits,2018-06-28 12:11:28+00:00,Next of kin denying tests and deviating from Doctors' plan,"Hey everyone I'm in Florida.

I had to call 911 after discovering my boyfriend writhing and moaning on the floor in the night, unable to stay awake for long.

In ICU, he has had a 103 degree fever and has gone from glucose of 1200 to around 250, and his sodium is also being managed. He has been diagnosed with diabetes, but his erratic behavior, far outside the range of DKA behavior, is unknown and believed to be caused by infection somewhere. However, his urine and blood havr all tested negative for viral/bacterial infection even as his white blood cell count is wayyyy above normal. His family wont let us do lumbar puncture to test the csf.

 His fever went down, until I called his next of kin (Mother and Father). His mom is a nurse practicioner, but is mostly in a teaching role and is mentally unstable (hoarding, multiple storage units full of food, clothes, and rats). Because of her perceived skill at medicine, she has been micromanaging all hospital staff that she can, and denying procedures such as a lumbar puncture (the doctors think meningitis is very possible) and pushing for his breathing tube to come out prematurely.

His fever had been controlled by tylenol, a cooling blanket, and a fan. She insisted that these things be taken off and said she would agree to lumbar puncture if his fever spiked again. Well, his fever did spike, back up to 103. His respiration is getting worse, he is still agitated whenever woken, and they are discussing inducing medical coma today. She was informed and backpedeled on her previous claim to consent the LP. I am just waiting and watching my love get worse. His fever is still raging.

I am tired of her playing doctor with the man I have loved for years and have lived with as partners for 4 years. The doctors are frustrated, with their tests being rejected and replaced with her own requests. I live in Florida so I am not recognized as a common law wife.

Is there anything I can do? Can I have another doctor elected his surrogate because she has a conflict of interest in practicing medicine on her own son? I am ready to get an advance directive from him when he wakes up, but I dont know when he will and if he will still be himself when he does.

They have always had a bad relationship, him and his parents. She admitted to me that she knew he would be upset if he even knew she was present at the hospital. Even she knows his wishes but wont follow them, and his dad follows along.

What options do I have?

Thank you so much! I'm spending every waking moment with him and I want him to please have a second chance at life.

13easttexasfarmer,2018-06-27 13:17:50+00:00,[Update] Help. Animals were killed by neighbor's wolf dog.,"Here's an update from my [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/88zvrf/help_animals_were_killed_by_neighbors_wolf_dog).

We had lost various animals to our neighbor's wolf dog. One our sheep had survived the attack and we had taken her to the vet since our neighbor had agreed to cover the costs. She had also agreed to replace the other animals we had lost to her dog. The vet costs were more than our neighbor had bargained for an she decided she had done enough. 

So as suggested, I went ahead and sent a demand letter against my neighbor for the animals that her wolf dog had killed. I recounted our version of the events and asked to be compensated for the animals we had lost. I sent it on 4/6/18 and never heard back from her. On 5/21/18, I went ahead and filed a small claims against her. When I went to file, I had my demand letter and proof that she had signed for it with me. The clerk (who later turned out to be the county's Justice of the Peace) told me that she did not need those documents, only my form for the suit. That I would have to bring those copies in when a court date was set. At some point my neighbor was served, and on 6/6/18 I received a notarized letter from her where she stated her side of the story and said she did not feel she owed us anything, since she had paid for the vet bill and her dog had been killed. She went on to put the blame on the fact that we lived in a rural area and she tried to pass the blame on other dog's in the area that would roam with her dog. 

Now, I'm aware that I live in a rural area. But we haven't lost any more animals since her dog was killed. Our animals aren't constantly being chased by her dog and the other dogs she has put the blame on, no longer come into our property. Either way, we looked forward to pleading our case. 

On 6/15/18, I received the court letter with our court date. On 6/22/18, I received a call from the Justice of the Peace's office, the clerked advised me that I needed to bring in a copy of the vet bill. This through me for a loop since I had not mentioned a vet bill in my suit and I was not allowed to leave a copy of my demand letter. Either way, I made copies of everything I had. Including screenshots from a video, where there wolf dog refused to leave the sheep carcass on our property. 

I had court yesterday, and I lost. 

While we waited for our trial to begin, she was catching up with the constable that was assigned to our case. While it is a small town, it made me feel uneasy that she was obviously friends with him. Our trial was in a small court room, my witnesses were not allowed inside until they were asked to tell their version of events. She was allowed to bring in her husband. He was allowed to question me and he blamed me for not telling him sooner. He was rude and arrogant. Their whole strategy was that I should have told them about their dog being a problem. The problem was mine. She also accused me of fabricating my story since for some reason the police report noted that we had lost 80 chickens when we had really lost 8. I simply stated that it was possible it was a typo, the whole report had errors. When she did this, I pointed out how her story had changed from the notarized letter she sent me. In the letter she stated that she had seen her dogs and other dogs eating something on our property but she drove on. When she got back from the doctor, she saw that there was a dead animal and she decided to come see what had happened. In court, she said that she stopped by as soon as she had see her dog attacking our sheep. What actually happened, she didn't stop by til she saw a deputy at our house. 

During the trial, she brought up that our dogs pee on our property and had photos of them on her property. I'm not sure how that was relevant but the judge took it as evidence. I'm not justifying that our dogs be allowed on her property. That's something I aim to fix but her property isn't even fenced off. So I'm confused at how this was relevant. Additionally, at one point her husband argued with me that I was probably just seeing a coyote on our property and that I had simply confused it with their dog. I confused a coyote with a white husky like dog wearing a red collar. 

The judge favored with my neighbors. She stated that I had no other proof that their dog was responsible for our other animals. That she had paid enough with the vet bill and that in the future I should try to notify my neighbors of what their dogs are doing. I needed to have photos ready of every single time I saw that dog on our property. 

I was floored. I felt like my case was built around their testimony. Am I wrong in feeling this way?

I appreciate all the help y'all provided. Unfortunately, it didn't bring me the resolution I had hoped for, I've lost faith in East Texas Courts.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8u9j8k/update_help_animals_were_killed_by_neighbors_wolf/,legaladvice,3187,1,0.0

mattleiber,2018-06-26 10:29:43+00:00,Got caught stealing.,"Hello Reddit,

This is my first ever post and it's unfortunately a disheartening one.

Recently at my job at an oil change facility I happened to catch an subordinate employee who was transferred from another shop to mine stealing money from customers. 

The way in which he was doing so was after the service was completed a customer would pay for their bill ($20.96) with a $100 bill. He then would enter it into the system as the customer gave him $80 instead of the $100 bill and pocketed the difference.  I can prove he did this at least twice, one right after another in the same day. 

The proof I have is:

- The customers both came back for the rest of their change furious about the incident after I sent the employee in question home. I was able to verify this because another employee and i witnessed him putting the only $100 bills into the drawer from said transactions

- One of the other employees who had caught the suspect slipping the cash into his pocket was offered a cut to keep his mouth shut and that he did this l the time since it wouldn't affect the cash count later.

-Both customers positively Identified the employee

- I have copies of the invoices showing the deed and how it doesn't make sense that a customer would pay for a $20.96 oil change with (4) $20 bills. 

After I pulled the cash drawer and started counting it to insure the thief wasn't also pocketing money from the company and the employee noticed what I was doing a small fire was started. Now I can't say it was intentional or if the employee for certain did it at this time but it was started with a cigarette. The same brand the suspect smokes in the same area he was seen before it happened. I personally think that this was extremely coincidental and more like used as a diversion but much to the employees dissatisfaction I happened to put out the fires with the cash drawer in hand as to not leave it alone to let anything taint what evidence I had.

After everything was calmed at the shop and the employee was sent home, I called the district manager and the store manager and let them know exactly what happened. The district manager was in charge of the transfer of said employee and from what he himself told me have a personal / family connection outside of work, which leaves room for nepotism. 

The employee was  allowed to stay after all was said and done. He didn't even get written up. The owner of the company isn't aware or any of these incidents, as the nepotistic district manager isn't telling him a thing and I dont have a way of contacting him directly. 

This employee also was the soul reason another employee had quit. Citing he was stealing sales from him and physically threatening him. Also met with no write up.

What can i do? I'm torn because the customers could easily call the customers care line and voice the issue to corporate call center but its puts a big target on this smaller franchise and leaves my job on the line.

I don't know breed, mom bought it). We have warning signs on it but it's otherwise not fenced off. I got home yesterday to see someone with a kid with a bandaged hand, apparently he grabbed the cactus. Thing is, I noticed the cactus later and there isn't a single spine that doesn't have blood on it. The cactus is like 2 feet tall, you can't grab all the spines in one go. This child would have had to grab the cactus, impale his hand, let go, then do it again about 15 or so times. I think the guy wants to sue for medical bills, heard him say something about emotional trauma too but this sub tends to lean towards ""emotional trauma claims don't go very far in court"".

Other than ""retain legal counsel, respond to actual legal letters if sent any"", I've got some questions.

1. Is a cactus an attractive nuisance? It's not a fruit, it looks pretty damn scary, what sort of idiot would it attract?

2. Barring the child having some sort of pain disorder, is it a valid excuse to say ""no reasonable person would have subjected themselves to pain 15 or so times, we didn't anticipate your kid could be this fucking dumb""

3. Could I be being scammed? IIRC cactus spines are meant to come off after they stick into someone and honestly I don't see any that did. It's a bit far-fetched, but maybe they bandaged the kid's hand and poured some pig's blood (it's definitely blood, I know the smell) onto the cactus? The guy did start unwrapping his kid's hand before I went ""that's fucking gross stop that"", and there's something definitely up with the kid's hand, I just don't know if it's my cactus.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8trpma/south_carolina_some_8_year_old_skewered_their/,legaladvice,2377,150,0.0
ACoyKoi,2018-06-25 14:05:39+00:00,"Woman offered to pay for funeral, never delivered.","Okay, first time posting here, and not very hip to legal stuff but just wanted to ask.

My grandmother passed on 6/9/18. Very sudden. A 'friend' of one of my aunt's (grandmother's youngest daughter) got ahold of the family, and offered to cover the costs of the funeral, stating she owed my grandmother her life for taking her in and treating her like one of her own and being the reason she got clean off of drugs. We will call her Sarah. Apparently she was receiving a large sum of money that I believe I overheard was a life insurance policy from her own mother passing recently but I cannot say that with too much confidence. 

She was helpful in the whole grieving process but my family was unwilling to just let her pay for everything so they made plans to make a savings fund for Sarah's child. They would pay Sarah back in that way since she refused payback any other way. 

When they (grandma's four kids and Sarah) went to the funeral home to figure out what was going to happen, everything ended up being just shy of $10,000. Sarah apparently had told the funeral director she was paying for it and to not let anyone reduce costs in any way. Because they tried to see what could be skimmed and he told them what Sarah (who had left right after the main portion of the meeting) had said.

Only one of my aunts signed the paperwork. No one else.

Everyone was so greatful. She made herself seen many times over the next few days and spoke at the funeral. The funeral director approached my aunt and informed us he had not received payment yet. Sarah made excuses. First about the money just having cleared her account, then about her husband writing the check out to her not the funeral home. Then she left and said she would be back and did not return. As of now no one has heard from her and we have started a GoFundMe to try and pay for it ourselves, instead of the savings account we had originally planned. We are unsure if there's anything we can even do.

adopteddogthrowaway,2018-06-25 02:37:27+00:00,"[NJ] Adopted formerly stray dog from humane society two years ago, now original owners threatening to sue me","Two years ago (June 2016) I adopted a dog from a humane society in New Jersey. The humane society picked her up as a stray and had her for about a year and a half before I adopted her. This is the only humane society near the city where she was rescued (important detail), and they frequently advertised her on social media. She was also listed for adoption on a popular website where shelters and rescues post their dogs. They even used her photo on their printed advertisements.

I regularly post photos of my dog on Instagram, and since I live in the city where the humane society rescued her, I have many of the posts geotagged.

Last week, someone commented on one of the posts claiming that I ""stole their dog."" I messaged them and explained how she had been picked up as a stray, was at the shelter for 1.5 years, etc. They said she was their dog and ""disappeared"" about four years ago in the city and they have been ""searching for her ever since.""

I'm fairly confident that they DID previously own my dog. They sent me photos of her when she was a puppy (I adopted her as an adult), they also live in the city where she went missing, and they kept referring to her as ""Clara."" When I call her Clara, she responds to it.

Now here's the thing: they're claiming she was a ""pure bred pitbull"" and paid $3,000 for her. They said they're going to sue me for possession of the dog that I ""stole"" from them and that I owe them $3,000 for her.

So my question is, what do I do? Do they have any legal ground to stand on? Can I be sued?

She is a special needs dog stemming from abuse, likely at the hand of the original owner. She has scars, bite marks, etc. I really don't want to lose her and have her go back to that abusive life. I love her so much.

Since the original owners live in the same city where she was found, and the same city as the humane society, if they really wanted to find her like they claimed, wouldn't the humane society be the first place any rational person would look? She wasn't microchipped or anything when she was rescued (obviously now she is w/ my info).",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8tn1vm/nj_adopted_formerly_stray_dog_from_humane_society/,legaladvice,1217,91,0.0

He's giving me until tomorrow, and I doubt I'll be able to find a lawyer in 24 hours on a weekend. So, I'm considering these options:

* Say nothing at all and take action if I am sent to collections
* Call and tell them it's not my problem, the contract doesn't show that I owe anything, they can't send me to collections for a fault of their own
* Fold and sign a new contract, forfeiting my maintenance package while still having to pay for it + more$ every month to cover their ""mistake""",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8td158/updateoregon_car_dealership_messed_up_my/,legaladvice,1103,161,0.0

inheriteddebt,2018-06-22 05:15:51+00:00,Update - [NV] - Inherited overwhelming debt from a brokerage account.,"Location:  Las Vegas, NV 
This is an update to the posts I made here: https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/6hyiq6/nv_inherited_overwhelming_debt_from_a_brokerage/
https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6izabv/update_and_more_questions_inherited_debt_from_a/

We ended up settling before going to court. I'm under a NDA and a non-disparagement as apart of the settlement so I cannot disclose the exact amounts or who the brokerage was, but I am allowed to talk generalities about the case and I can say that the final payout to me was above 500k. I've cleared this post with my lawyer after being really careful knowing that people who have talked about settlements have lost such settlements. 

The brokerage fought tooth &amp; nail on absolutely everything about the claim. They tried their hardest to have it go to binding arbitration with FIRNA. They tried claiming the individual account I created to received the TOD bounded the estate to arbitration. They also tried claiming that my dad had agreed to arbitration through a click through agreement, even though they didn't have any signatures of him agreeing to arbitration. It turns out he created the account with the brokerage in 1985 and they didn't require arbitration then. The 1987 Supreme Court case Shearson v. McMahon was making it unclear if arbitration would apply, and for good reason my lawyer was trying to avoid arbitration with FIRNA. 

I was able to pull out the original transfer on death form my dad submitted to the brokerage. In the contract it clearly states that they had to liquidate any leveraged position, options position, any position on margin, and any position that is unsuitable for the beneficiary. So this shows a clear fiduciary duty to the beneficiary. Thank you Dad for keeping good records! 

Not to excuse them, but their reasoning for not liquidating it was since the TOD was so old the account wasn't marked as a TOD account in their computer systems. They were searching for it and weren't aware of their obligations. No one actually bothered to look into the account to see it had risky speculative bets. They were holding the positions as-is and was only going to let the account go to the estate. Things may have turned out differently if I didn't find the TOD form. 

Since Dad's other stock buys like in Rite-Aid tanked we decided to ask for the cash value on the day the broker was notified + punitive damages + acting in bad faith + other securities violations. 

I ended up paying my lawyers on contingency and I'm glad I did that instead of hourly. I had both an estate lawyer who hired out a securities lawyer. It aligned both of their interests and with the brokerage fighting on every single point it worked out to about 1,000~ total billable hours for them + associates/paralegals, a forensic accountant, a CPA, etc. 

Ultimately it came down to days before our court date the brokerage didn't want to get bad publicity over it. I'm sure they were paying a fortune in lawyers too. I feel the settlement is fair and puts me more than whole. I didn't want to risk a judge ruling against me or ruling that we had to arbitrate, and likewise the brokerage didn't want to risk setting precedence in a court diminishing enforcement of arbitration clauses. 

One thing I learned about selecting a lawyer is you don't just want someone who knows the law, you want someone who is a damn good negotiator and who is very hungry. I think he was a bit let down when I accepted the settlement though, as I think he was gearing up for a case that would make his career if we were able to set new precedence. I was just exhausted with the case and just wanted it to be over.  ",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8sys1y/update_nv_inherited_overwhelming_debt_from_a/,legaladvice,1122,1,1.0

zaqxswcde32,2018-06-21 10:22:24+00:00,[USA-NY] 24 year old male. My doctor called and told my mother he treated my genital warts,"I had one genital wart removed and my insurance covered it fully. Later my doctor kept pushing for a skin biopsy on my chest that was completely irrelevant to my genital wart. 
I finally agreed and signed the paper after he told me how risky it could be for cancer. He performed the procedure but the nurse forgot to verify that the insurance is covering it. I understand I need to pay because I signed paperwork saying I'd be responsible if my insurance didn't pay. 

However he called my mother introducing himself as the doctor who treated my genital warts. Then he goes on to tell her he needs a few thousand dollars for the procedure. 

Is that even legal? I thought he wasn't allowed to reveal another condition unless it comes down to the insurance not paying. 

I literally told the doctor my family couldn't know about the wart and he tried to use it against me to scare me and my mom into paying immediately. My insurance kicked me off for doing so many unnecessary procedures with this guy. He would convince me everything could potentially be cancerous. 

I understand it's my fault for not doing my research and being gullible so I'll have to pay for that. However I'm pretty upset he had to tell my mom about my STI condition when there was no issue with the billing. He was paid and it was done over a year ago. It was completely irrelevant to his call to collect. He called to collect from a skin biopsy of a mole on my chest.

My parents recently wrote me a letter saying that due to a South Dakota filial responsibility law, I am required by law to support them financially if they cannot support themselves.  They said they cannot afford rent, food, or medical care because they are paying around a thousand dollars a month keeping up with minimum payments on credit cards.  They claim they are in $40,000 of credit card debt. They cannot declare bankruptcy because they already did that 4 years ago.  They want $3000 a month from me in parental support.  I feel this is outrageous as there are government programs to cover their basic needs.  They can go on food stamps, they are old enough for Medicare, and there's income based housing.   Oh, and they have no retirement plan or long term care plan.  So that will be ""fun"" in a few years.

What are our options?","On Saturday, as we (me, husband, 1 year old daughter) were walking home from an event at the local elementary school, we noticed a man walking back and forth in the middle of an intersection. He saw us and changed direction to follow us. He followed us to our front door and attempted to open the door for several minutes while we called 911. The dispatcher told me a man matching that description had been reported missing from a home for the mentally disabled on the next street over. I requested an officer come speak with us, but they never did. I had to call our local police department back to even find out what was going on.

&amp;nbsp;

On Monday evening, we were playing with our daughter in our front yard and driveway when I noticed the same man shuffling down our street alone again. He heard us in the yard, turned and crossed the street towards our house, and again he went to our front door and attempted to open the door and look into our window. As soon as I saw him turn and head towards our driveway, we grabbed our daughter, told him to leave, and ran inside to call 911. Again, I requested an officer stop by, but 2 hours later we hadn't had any contact with an officer. I called the department again and was told he was taken back to his home and that our only option was to lock our doors and keep calling 911 when this happens. 

&amp;nbsp;

I've spoken with our neighbors across the street (directly behind the man's house), and they said he moved in about 2-3 months ago and they've never seen him without an aide. When the police gave me his address I walked over to talk with his aide. The aide refused to give me any information about the agency he works for and denied that the man was ever alone that night. When I mentioned that our Ring doorbell had recorded both incidents, he got extremely defensive and closed the door in my face.

&amp;nbsp;

We don't know anything about this man, or what he is capable of, except that he is mentally disabled in some capacity. This has now been twice in 3 days and we are afraid to spend time outside (especially me home alone with the little one all day). What are our options here? Is our only option really to just keep calling 911 every time this happens? What if he manages to get into our home? Both incidents have been terrifying and we are so lost on what we can do about this. Thank you.

I never rented a car from them. (San Jose, California)","Thank you to everyone for the advice. I'm also a SHE by the way (many of you thought I was a dude lol), but on to the update:  
  
  
  
  

After my initial post, I saw that many of you advised for me to call the manager and demand information from her because Enterprise is the one at fault and I shouldn't have to go to the police for their mistake. So I did exactly this, and she told me that id I want her to give me more info, I would need to file a police report within 24 hours and email it to her as evidence that I am NOT the person who rented the car.  If not, she would report me for Embezzlement and Grand Theft to the Sacramento Police. Upon hearing this, I decided to file a report immediately online with the San Jose Police Department. I know many of you said I shouldn't because its not my fault but after she told me the consequences, I did not want to take any chances where I could end up with a warrant on my head.  I thought that if anything, filing this report would also prove my innocence if the police actually did come knocking on my door.  
  
  
  
  
After filing it, I emailed her the copy and she responded the next day, saying that she recieved it and to give her a call.  When I spoke to her over the phone this time, she said that I was in the clear and finally gave me information about what had happened:  
  
  
  

On May 29, a woman claiming to be me had come in to rent out a black cadillac. She showed the representative ""her"" drivers license that had MY information on it, and paid for the car rental upfront with CASH. (I thought that you need a credit card to do this but apparently you can just use cash) The manager also says that she has video surveillance of the woman which she will turn into the Sacramento Police later that afternoon. The following morning, she emailed me the number of her report which she filed as FRAUD, and said that the police opened up an investigation which she will keep me updated on.  At this point, I was relieved to be in the clear yet also pissed that some woman is out there impersonating me. I then started contemplatig about taking a 3 hour drive to Sacramento see who the hell this woman is. However, turns out I didn't have to because 2 HOURS LATER...  
  
  
  

THE SAN JOSE POLICE DID SHOW UP KNOCKING ON MY FRONT DOOR. ( 2 Policemen and 2 CHP officers) Before opening it, the first thing I did was grab the copy of the police report I printed because I seriously thought that they were going to arrest me  (2 squad cars, 4 officers, and 1 me). When I open the door,  the first thing they ask me is if NAME OF WOMAN I DO NOT KNOW lives at my home? I tell them no, and that I have no idea who that is,  then they ask if I am ALYMG1 and I tell them that I am. They then begin to inform me about a car accident that happened in the nearby town of Fremont that morning. The accident was a hit and run, with the driver fleeing the scene but she dropped her drivers license which they found on the floor. They then show the license to me and it's an EXACT replica of MY DRIVERS LICENSE, and I ask them how this is possible if I have my license in my wallet? They then tell me to go grab it and after comparing the two side by side, one of them tells the others that the one they have is a fake. (The black strip on theirs is chipping but mine isn't... it's not supposed to chip) I then ask them if the driver  was the woman who stole the car from Enterprise, and they ask me to ellaborate which is when I hand them my report. I explain what happened which prompts them to give me more details about the accident, and they tell me that the woman was driving a stolen car and crashed into another vehicle, but she fled the scene in the black cadillac from Enterprise.  So basically, the rental car was used as the ""getaway car"" and was identified by the witnesses in the other vehicle. I told the officers that I have the plate number of the vehicle in the demand letter, and the that info down as well. I then asked them who is the NAME OF THE WOMAN I DO NOT KNOW and they told me that she is the who stole the car. However, I'm not sure how they know that (fingerprints maybe) but they did show me her mugshot, and we DO NOT look a-like at all. Idk how the hell she was able to rent the car in the first place but whoever rented it to her probably didn't even check for a comparison. But after this, the police then thanked me and told me that they'll call me when there's an update on the case.  
  
  
   
I do have her name now though, and After doing a google search I found her Facebook and other social media accounts. I'm very tempted to message her but I've decided to leave this to the police because I have no idea who this bitch is, and don't know if she's dangerous (she might be gang affiliated or something  and she DOES know where I live) However, I do hope that they catch this bitch and will update you all when that happens.

The cop asks for my license and registration, after a half hour, he tells me, ""I'm doing you a favor by not bringing you in, your license has been suspended for selling drugs."" I was baffled, at first I laughed out of disbelief, and then was quickly informed that it was not a joke.   


My charges are as follows:

* DIVERS VIEW OBSTRUCTED
* NO/INADEQUATE LIGHTS
* OPERATING WITHOUT INSURANCE 
* UNLICENSED OPERATOR 
* AGGRAVATED UNLIC OP 3RD (MISD)

I'm claiming guilty to my inadequate lights and obstructed view, I had my graduation tassel hanging from my mirror. I'm certain this is a clerical mistake as there are many people with the same name where I live. Because I didn't know my license was suspended for a crime I didn't commit I received charges that I otherwise wouldn't have. I've prepared the following pieces of information in my defense:

* Pay stubs prior to the crime to prove my work hours of 8:00am to 5:00pm.
* Gym check-in's Monday through Friday from the hours of 6:30pm to 8:00pm.
* Driving history.
* Proof of insurance.
* My clean criminal history aside from the alleged crime, leading to my license suspension.

On the recommendation of a friend, he made an appointment at an upscale barbershop near his office, and went in for a cut. He told the barber what he wanted (short, out of his face, requiring no maintenance other than washing and brushing) and got his haircut. He immediately hated the cut (it was the exact opposite of what he had asked for, short everywhere except at the center top where it hung in his eyes, it is the cut colloquially called ""the fashy"" as it's popular with the alt right), and when he tried to complain the stylist told him they didn't have time to fix it and to come back another day. He came home visibly upset, and asked me to write a review of the place for him that detailed what he didn't like about the experience.

I left the review, and didn't think much of it, until I started receiving strange sexually harassing emails today. (Basically a lot of stuff from people saying they're going to find me and rape me, and telling me to go back to my safe space.)

I noticed that one of the emails also included a defense of the business, so I did some quick investigating, and found front and center on the businesses facebook page a post with screenshots of my review, my personal information (I had paid for my husband's cut the day before as a gift, to encourage him to do something nice for himself), mocking and sexually explicit comments about me, as well as the business account ""liking"" sexually explicit and violent comments about me left by others.

I've taken screenshots of all of it, and blocked the emails that come in, but this is a small business, so I highly doubt the owner is not aware of what's going on, if he's not the one that posted these things outright.

After reading this sub a little I understand people usually make update posts?

I just want to thank everyone for the advice, some of it more helpful to my situation than others (I kind of giggled a little at the thought of me retaining a lawyer- I’m not going to legally flame my aunt unless I have a death wish). Thanks for the suggestion anyway! If they weren’t a family member you’d bet your bottom dollar that I’d be getting back pay/ filing a wage complaint. I did like some of the arguments you guys provided so I decided to use some of them. Oh and I forgot to mention that I’m a girl in the last post. 

I applied at a local craft store for the evening shift and also to be waitstaff at a retirement home. I told my mom about it, and she asked what about my aunts cafe? Are you going to work two jobs now? I said no I’m not volunteering there anymore especially if I get another job. She frowned and said that I made a commitment to my aunt. I denied that. Then came the family trap card, but I was prepared. I said if my aunt valued ME as a family member she would pay me for my effort, that I’m technically working there illegally, that I don’t understand why my mom would support her for making me work for nothing. 

Now here’s where my other post failed to explain the entire situation. My mom is a single mother and a great one at that. I mentioned in the last post that I was confused why my mom was making me do this. Most of my childhood she worked her ass off to provide for me so I know she knows the value of people’s time. 

However, when my mom was working when I was little my aunt helped out a lot. She would watch me, help out with dinner/groceries, make up the difference on her rent, etc. I should mention that when I “worked” the first two years at that cafe it was basically because my mom didn’t want me home alone and I stayed there to clean up tables with my cousin. It was fun until my cousin stopped coming and my aunt made me work for real. 

With that said, my mom and I are on good ground right now. My mom has savings, a good job thanks to community college, and a house. My aunt knows she had a big role in this and will never let my mom forget that. So when I asked my mom why she was on my aunts side in this job situation she kind of sighed and said that we owe my aunt so much more than we can ever pay back, that we should help her out whenever.

 I suspect my aunt leveraged her own “kindness” she gave in the past against my mom again to get me to work wage free. Ive only recently picked up that my aunt does this- my mom would act weird sometimes and I wouldn’t notice why, until I overheard a conversation like a month ago with her convincing my mom to drive my cousin like 4 hours round trip because she “owed her”. Maybe my aunt does this all the time and Im not aware. Or, maybe I’m wrong but I have a very strong feeling I’m not. My aunt is not a nice woman. I’m just kind of pissed that my aunt probably made my mom a target of her manipulative bullshit just to get free labor out of me. Anyway before I got worked up when talking to my mom I just said ok and went to bed to sleep it off. 

I came up with a plan to convince my aunt to let me out of this “job” and hopefully not pitch a fit to make my mom more guilty for being a “burden” in the past. I literally practiced my arguments in the shower haha. (And made myself 2x the amount of specialty drinks on the job out of spite)  

So Friday morning I asked my aunt how the shops doing. She said great, she just hired a graphic designer and is looking TO FRANCHISE. Here I thought she was in some financial hot water or something, hence me working for nothing, but she’s just a cheapskate. (I feel used tbh)

 But I said wow that’s cool I know you’re a great businesswoman but this is fantastic, great job. She smiled at me for once and said thank you I know you know that I’ve worked 24/7 for this. I told her that she’s such a role model and honestly if I had 10 percent of the will she had I would be successful in life... and that actually I applied for another job! I’m going to save up for college, get some credit going, and be successful like her. 

She seemed kinda happy, and said oh that’s great. She said It’s good to know that I’m being my own woman. Then I responded that I was thankful for what she did for me and my mom, that this job was a great experience to put on my resumé, and that because I’m branching out into the world I can’t work here anymore :). 

She sighed, and started up, “I’m sure you could do weekends here though?”. I said I would love to but not once I start another job. She seemed a bit skittish, but said alright. Not once did she offer to pay me. I’m waiting for her to change her mind.

After I told my mom last night what my aunt said she was cool with me not working there, and she was glad I was looking to build savings. 

This morning though, my she said to me that my aunt told her I was a good kid and a hard worker (and that I’m welcome to work at the cafe whenever I want). I’ll pass 😒

charlottedhouse,2018-06-16 00:46:06+00:00,(FINAL UPDATE) My new employer has a creative way of doing payroll that just doesnt seem...legal. Are you ready for a Justice Boner?,"I was waiting to update this pending Big Doings by the corporate office, so thank you. 

So I quit, though I bet you all saw that coming. 

I gave 4 weeks notice per the crazy ass owners “requirement” because I decided to move out of state and had the time. 

Then he decided to try and screw me. When the schedule for my last 2 weeks came out, I wasn’t on it. He apparently told the manager not to schedule me because I was “toxic” and “not a team player”. 

But, as the saying goes, I didn’t get mad. I got even. 

I knew he would try to call me in. Because that’s what happens when you only have two people to close and one isn’t working. So every time he called I said “I wasn’t scheduled today, so I made plans.”

After about a week he threatened to fire me. My response? “You already did. Constructive dismissal exists. You reduced my hours to zero, basically firing me. I’ve already been to the unemployment office.” (I didn’t, I was moving, but I wanted to hear his heart audibly stop.)

Then I asked about my last check. Since he’s fired me, I needed to pick it up. He said I could get it on payday and hung up. 

I should also note that during this time I send a very lengthy email to the corporate office detailing every single shady and illegal thing this ass was doing. From trying to write work arounds for labor laws into the land book, to getting employees to pay him back “overpayments” with personal checks, to the contamination, all of it. With pictures. 

So payday rolls around. No check. I call and no one answers. I go in person and no one knows anything because apparently, no one got paid. No one. Not even the managers. There’s no direct deposit, he always cut paper checks (and forward dated them 3 days) so everyone was screwed. 

But me? I was walking on sunshine. Straight to small claims the next day with a written letter from the assistant manager (who’s a friend, tbh) verifying that I had quit and not been paid and calls to the owner about it hadn’t been returned. He had two days or until the next pay period, as long as it didn’t exceed 30 days, to pay me after separation. 

He showed up and tried to say the Internet was down, which is why I wasn’t paid on time, but the judge was having none of it. I got the max I could claim, 3x what he originally owed me. And the joy of seeing him get dressed WAY TF DOWN. 

And it gets better. Due to my emails and photos (along with other employees who made reports) Corporate descended on that franchise like a swarm of angry Valkyries. 

I was long gone and moved away by the time they actually did anything but he got ousted. 

Officially, he turned it over to spend time with his family (cause his daughter joined a Christian cult and ran away???)  but really corporate was FURIOUS at the shit he was doing and the terrible reputation the place had (essentially damaging the brand) so they threatened to rain legal brimstone down on him so hard it would make god jealous unless he turned the store over. 

According to the assistant manager anyways. 

Alls well that ends well. I got paid and Asshole Supreme got a banging dose of karma. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8rftdz/final_update_my_new_employer_has_a_creative_way/,legaladvice,6591,2,0.0
CalledMe,2018-06-15 20:23:40+00:00,"UPDATE: Person Called Mobile Phone, Said He Was A Cop, Said I’d Stolen Gasoline","Here’s my original post from last night:
https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8r85ys/person_called_mobile_phone_said_he_was_a_cop_said/

I am still in New Jersey.

I went to the police station here in my town to report someone impersonating an officer, because that seems like a big deal.  I told an officer what happened, describing the phone call, and he asked if I’d given the caller any credit card information, or if he’d got as far as asking for that.  I said that I’d shut him down pretty hard, saying that there was absolutely no way, and he had just said I was going to be charged and hung up.  The officer nodded his head and said something about scammers who do this generally hang up quick if they aren’t getting anywhere.

The officer then called the police station in the other town to ask if they’d had a theft of gas last night and if they’d made a phone call.  And it turned out that they did, and that one of their officers had called me.  The cop I was talking to told them that I was there in the police station right then reporting it as a scam call by someone impersonating an officer.

The person on the other end talked for a little bit, there was some “uh-huh” and “yeah” on our end, and then he said they wanted my home phone number.  I gave it to him, he repeated it to them, and then hung up.

He told me that I didn’t have to worry about it, that they had a mistake in one of the digits on the license plate, and the officer who called me last night would call again on Monday morning to explain what had happened.

It was instructive that the police officer I was talking to believed it was a scam, and strange to me that the police officer who called me on the phone was unable to distinguish himself from a scammer, by doing things such as repeating his name and not just hanging up the phone so abruptly.

The officers took the posts then one handed him something (not sure if a citation, pamphlet, or something else) and drove away.  Neighbor left for work in a huff about 30 mins later.

runthrowawaygirl,2018-06-14 09:39:49+00:00,[Update] 21 and no longer a prisoner,"[Link to my initial post for reference](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8qqeh5/21_and_a_prisoner_in_my_parents_home/)

I did it. I left. 

Currently writing this from the backseat of an Uber at 2 am, on my way to my friend’s house with 5 bags of personal belongings that I packed in the last hour. My hands are shaking, somewhat out of fear but mostly out of immense relief. I don’t have everything figured out, but for now I’m free and I have the space to figure things out as they come up. 

Once I get to my friend’s place, I am planning to call both the LA police and OC police non-emergency numbers to report that I am okay (not missing) and inform them that my parents may file a false missing person’s report tomorrow morning. First thing tomorrow morning, I’m heading straight to the office of my university dean to see what assistance they can offer me, as well as update them on my situation. I anticipate that my parents will also try to contact them. 

But now that I’m actually out, I have some important decisions to make. My sudden decision to leave tonight was spurred by a conversation I had with my dad after dinner. My mom was upstairs so she was not present for the conversation. I should preface what I’m about to say with explaining what I meant by “physical abuse” in my initial post. See, whenever I talk with my dad and my responses aren’t satisfactory to him, he will beat me. Sometimes it’s with a large piece of wooden crown molding, a thin wooden switch, a belt, a golf club, a thick textbook (probably enough examples for now). Pretty much all of my responses don’t meet his expectations, so I get beat pretty bad if he’s angry. Some photos I have include pictures of my thighs that are covered in welts and broken blood vessels (days later, the marks turned into hard bruises). 

Anyways, back to tonight’s conversation. For all of today, I basically stayed in my room, reading books and organizing some of my stuff. My parents kept complaining that I wouldn’t spend time with them, but I hope it makes sense why I’m not particularly keen on doing that. So after dinner, my dad confronts me to ask why I’m “acting like I’m so depressed.” I respond by saying I don’t have much to talk about, and I’d rather be left alone. This angered him a lot, and he began to lecture me about how “bringing you home was supposed to change you, can’t you see we’re just trying to help you.” I didn’t reply at this point, so he says this verbatim: “If you have no will to live, just tell me and I’ll get the knife” (meaning he would assist me in committing suicide). 

That triggered a nerve in me, due to my past struggles with depression and my parents not taking my diagnosis seriously, so I replied with “If I wanted to kill myself, I don’t need your help.” Then he got up to go to the kitchen, came back with a knife, and just said “Okay then.” At this point, I realized that this was serious, and I had no doubt that my dad would not hesitate to cause me even more physical harm if I continued to anger him. So I chose to placate him by promising to try harder and be a better daughter, which seemed to satisfy him and he went upstairs to go to bed. 

Which brings us to now. Once I confirmed that both of my parents were asleep, I began packing everything I could fit in the biggest bags that I owned. Enough clothes to last me for a few weeks, important documents, my passport, my license, and a few sentimental items. I called my friend, who was able to call me an Uber. While I waited for the car to arrive, I wrote a brief note to my parents to leave on my nightstand. In it, I apologized for doing what I did, told them I recognized that their actions were out of love and concern, but that their actions were straight-up abuse. I assured them that I would be safe, and ended by saying I hoped we could have a healthy relationship someday down the line. 

Now for the important decisions.

* Should I try to get a restraining order against my parents, in light of what happened tonight? This is the first time I’ve been legitimately scared for my life; I’ve been beaten many times before but those instances were “tolerable”. 
* I have the opportunity to go out of state for a few months (at least through the end of August). The distance is tempting, as it would put me much further from my parents. However, I don’t know if it would be too much of a hassle to deal with an out-of-state move, on top of already moving out of my parents’ place. 
* Does anyone know how applying for healthcare works? I apologize in advance if this seems like a very rudimentary question, but since I’ve relied on my dad’s job for healthcare, I have no idea how any of this works. Most importantly I would want healthcare to cover therapy and possibly medication; later on, I’ll need to visit the eye doctor at some point because I wear glasses/contacts. 
* When applying for jobs, is it a good or a bad idea to include a brief summary of my situation? I wouldn’t go into specifics about how my parents were abusive, but maybe just mention that I recently moved out of my parents’ house against their will and that I'm currently dealing with law enforcement?
* Are there any resources that I can contact in terms of financial assistance? I am not sure how long I can stay at my friend’s place (I think the maximum at the moment is through the end of June), and even if I start working soon I doubt I will have enough to pay for rent somewhere. 
* My landlord from my old place contacted me saying that I still need to pay rent for the months of June and July (my original lease was through July 2018). I thought my parents had discussed this with her while they were trying to move me out, but I guess I was stupid for believing them. I was originally anticipating to get my security deposit (2 months’ rent) back in July, once the lease for the place was up and my other roommates had moved out, but now it looks like I both won’t be getting that back and I’m liable for another 2 months’ rent. I already emailed her back to explain what’s happened and asked her if it’s possible to apply my deposit as rent, as a last resort. But do I have any legal recourse in releasing myself of the liability to pay that rent? I'm worried that she might try to take me to court over the unpaid rent, which could both hurt my credit score and might ruin my ability to live away from my parents.

Thanks so much to everyone who commented on my last post, whether it was with legal advice or just words of encouragement. I probably wouldn’t have gathered the courage to leave if I hadn’t made that post; it made me realize that if complete strangers can show more compassion than my own parents, then I shouldn’t keep believing my parents’ empty promises.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8r0j02/update_21_and_no_longer_a_prisoner/,legaladvice,2797,288,0.0
Kilen13,2018-06-13 14:08:58+00:00,"[FL] My neighbor has basically booby trapped his front yard, what can I legally do about it?","So I live in a house in a south Florida suburb where the streets are wide enough to allow street parking (legally) for guests as most houses only have a small driveway to fit a couple cars tops.  This has never been an issue in the 3 years I've lived here but lately my neighbor has gotten really obsessed about people driving ""up his lawn"" and scuffing his grass when they park and this week decided to do something about it.  

His grass goes all the way to the street and when people turn in to park they sometimes drive maybe a foot onto his grass if they're really careless.  I've always told my guests to park away from his house because I know how angry he gets about it and I don't want the hassle.  However said neighbor has now placed several rebar posts with the tops sharpened to tips right at the edge of his grass and they're low enough in that they're hard to spot if you're driving by or unfamiliar with the street.  I asked the neighbor about it when I was walking my dog and he said that if people are gonna be dicks and drive on his lawn they deserve to get their tires punctured.

runthrowawaygirl,2018-06-13 07:02:04+00:00,21 and a prisoner in my parents' home,"I'm 21, located in southern California. My parents' home is in Orange County, and I was attending university in Los Angeles County up until recently (fall 2014 \- winter 2017), when I took a leave of absence from school due to personal issues. Once my leave was finalized in January 2018, my parents made it clear to me that they wanted me to return home and live with them. However, I was not keen on this idea, since my parents and I have a somewhat strained relationship due to them not agreeing with a lot of my decisions and generally wanting to control aspects of my life. 

So I decided to stay put in the city where my university is located, and picked up several odd jobs in order to support myself financially (rent, food, other expenses); I continued to do this through May 2018. Through these 5 months, my parents would contact me occasionally to see how I was doing. If I didn't respond within an ""appropriate time frame"" in their eyes, which is less than a few hours, they would repeatedly call me (20\+ times in a row) or even show up outside my apartment unannounced. Finally, they got fed up with my lack of responding and forced me to move back home with them at the end of May; they did so by notifying my landlord that I would no longer be living there, coming to move out my stuff unannounced, and taking away my bank cards/ID/keys.

Originally when my parents brought me back home, they said that they would leave me to my own devices. So if I wanted to get a job, I could do so. Or if I wanted to go out and do something with my friends, I could do so. Basically, it would be like they were my landlords, so we were only tied together by a common living space. On the second night I was home, I made plans to go with some friends to a dance class. My parents allowed me to go out, and I told them approximately what time I'd be back home (between 1\-2 am). However, once it hit around 11 pm, my parents started calling and texting me, telling me to come back home because it was too late. I told them that I couldn't come home, since I had left my car at a friend's house because we had carpooled to the dance class together. For the next 3 hours, they continued to call and text me, and once I actually got home around 1:30 am, they took away my car keys and told me I wouldn't be allowed to leave the house again without them.

It's been 2 weeks now since I've been home, and I've only ever left my house to run errands with my parents. I've applied to multiple jobs near my house, since my parents keep pestering me to get one and I'd love to not be at home all the time, but my parents automatically veto any job I'm offered (retail, restaurant, tutor, receptionist, office clerk, etc). Therefore I've resorted to try and make some money by selling stuff online, like some of my clothes and shoes. One of my friends back at university is aware of everything that's happening, and he has offered to let me come stay at his place so that I can get away from my parents and figure stuff out. I have my debit card now and some cash, and I am planning on packing a few bags of necessities. I can get to my friend's place through public transit or by getting a ride with a friend.

So here are my legal questions:

1. If my parents report me as missing to the police, what will happen? Can I tell the police the details of my situation, so that I can prove I'm not ""missing"" and I left my parents' house on my own accord? What will the police say to my parents after I do this?
2. Is there a way to prevent my parents from contacting me or showing up at my new place? I'm guessing a restraining order, although I'm not sure if I would have enough evidence for the court to grant me one.
3. If my parents do show up at my new place, how do I get them to leave? Are there any legal consequences for them?
4. If I take belongings with me, like my cell phone and laptop, that my parents purchased for me years ago, could that be considered as stealing from them?
5. After I leave my parents' place, is there any way for me to come back and retrieve the rest of my stuff without having to interact with my parents directly?
6. What can I tell my parents in terms of legal facts of what they can and can't do? I think by giving them factual information on what they can and cannot do legally, they will be less likely to resort to extreme measures. I am still open to having a relationship with them in the future, just not right now because they are literally holding me hostage.

FeederFeedback,2018-06-12 21:42:27+00:00,[Ontario] Final update to Feeder Employee.,"A lot of people asked to know how it went Monday, and I am both glad and sad to say Sarah has been let go without much ado.

I went into work early Monday morning and carefully packed and wrapped all of Sarah's stuff (she had a lot of knick-knacks), and then was waiting with security when Sarah showed up for work.

I handed her the letter (checked and cleared by my lawyer late sunday night) and then the security guard handed her the box of her stuff. She opened the letter and quickly read through it and I watched all the color drained from her face when she saw the date I listed for the misuse of company property. I don't want to quote the letter too heavily for privacy, but it also said that she would receive her final paycheque via mail with the $200 removed for the professional floor cleaning, and that all material produced and resulting from the misuse of company property needed to be removed from any ""online or physical media within 3 days"" or I would have to pursue legal action.

At this point Sarah started to cry and it absolutely broke my heart, but she didn't make any argument (she didn't even say anything at all), but just handed over her employee badge and then she went back to her car sobbing without any incident.

I went back inside and broke the news to everyone else that Sarah had been caught in the misuse of company property and I had to let her go, and that a camera system would be installed this coming Friday. Everyone was pretty shocked, but I asked them to please refrain from discussing the incident as it was a confidential employment matter and they all agreed. Most of them just wanted to make sure I was okay, as apparently I looked a mess.

I'm taking my 3 days off work now, at home with my husband and our dog. I checked her fetlife account late Monday night and the photo set taken in the office has been wiped. Someone suggested I take my account offline for a bit, so I did (since I don't use it much anyways). I have cried a lot the past couple days now that the anger has pretty much gone out. Overall I still feel terrible about everything, but I suspect that will die out over time.

Again, thanks for all the sound advice and surprisingly deep support I received here.

Since that time I got denied for the second job and basically been coasting by until I landed another position and turned in my two weeks notice. 

Recently I found a position at a tech firm that will allow me to work from home, is easier than what I used to do, and pays more. Basically tired of doing nothing even though Im getting paid for it.  

The day after I mailed the keys to the satellite office back to the corporate office I got a phone call exactly at 8 AM. The head of HR for the former company wanted to speak with me in person. I asked her if there were any issues such as equipment that was not returned. She stated that there were no issues like that. They just had some questions about my job function over the last year. 

I told her that they should have that information as head of HR and promptly disconnected stating I had to return back to work. She called back at 12:05 exactly. 

I have been ducking her calls ever since. Her voicemails state that I am required to come into her office to discuss a few things. My emails with her have asked if there is anything that needs to be returned or issues with company property. Each time I am assured it is nothing like that, but that they need me to come into their office to discuss this with me in person. 

I am thinking I just need to ignore her until she either escalates or goes away.

akpetsittertrouble,2018-06-11 16:07:26+00:00,"[Alaska] Petsitter rented out my house without my knowledge, police say I need to formally evict","(I'm asking for a friend, and wrote in first person for clarity's sake.)

Two months ago, I asked a friend (Petsitter) to petsit/housesit while I was out of state on business. We didn't have a written contract or agreement. Petsitter was and is not paying rent or utilities.

Everything was going well until last week, when Petsitter called to say he wouldn't be able to watch the pets anymore. I asked another friend to stop by my place to check on the pets and the house. She told me there were people in my house, none of them were Petsitter.

I called the police to check my house, and remove the trespassers. The police told me the trespassers said they were tenants who had a verbal lease from Petsitter, and because the tenants had reason to believe they had tenants' rights, I had to formally evict them. The police said they couldn't do anything to help me.

A day or two later, I called the police again, and they went to my house. The police again said that the trespassers claimed to have a lease from Petsitter and to have been living there about a month, which meant they had tenants rights and the police couldn't do anything because I would need to go through formal eviction proceedings.

I've read the [Alaska Landlord Tenant Act](http://www.legis.state.ak.us/basis/statutes.asp#34.03.050), and I'm not sure whether Petsitter qualifies as a tenant. However, § 34.03.060 says a tenant ""may not sublet... without the landlord's consent."" Does this mean that the trespassers cannot have tenants rights because Petsitter did not have my consent to sublet? 

Can strangers really get tenants' rights even if they moved into my house without my permission or knowledge? Do I really need to go through formal eviction proceedings, or can I have the trespassers removed for trespassing? If necessary, how do I go through formal eviction proceedings from thousands of miles away? 

**TLDR**: 
Petsitter, who was not a tenant, supposedly sub-leased my house to trespassers without my knowledge or permission. Police say they can't help and I need to go through formal eviction proceedings, even though I'm thousands of miles away. Help!

They have possession of the laptop. Telling me that my paycheck will be deducted if it is not properly returned.","I live in Virginia, employer is HQ'd in Georgia

Was hired in January, was let go last week due to not meeting boss's expectations on pipeline growth (I'm a remote software sales guy). 

(Quite frankly I'm glad to go, it was not a good fit and I had arranged interviews this week already, prior to being let go, I harbor no bad feelings)

Thursday (6/7/18) was my last day, had a conference call that morning with boss and HR. My only instructions for the remainder of the day was to remove anything personal off the PC, to wipe the company issued iPhone, and head to the closest FedEx where they would package up the laptop, charging cable, and phone. I was given an account number whereby the company paid for the shipping and packaging. The package was to be overnighted and had to be there on Friday. 

I took pictures of the electronics being wrapped up, the shipping label, and the recipt. 

I was told to address the package to the woman in HR who was part of letting me go. 

I could not remember the spelling of the woman in HR's last name (it is complicated to spell and I cannot fully remember it, I met her the day I was being fired), so rather than do First Name Last Name, I addressed it to: 

(For sake of conversation I will call her Susan)

Company

Company Address

Attn: Susan - Head of HR 


I overnighted the package, it was signed by the receptionist. **It is in the company's possession.**

Susan is now refusing to ""accept"" the package. 

I called her this morning to confirm that she got the package. She was very curt with me this morning and is now telling me that I did not follow her specific instructions, therefore I am out of compliance with their equipment return policy (part of an agreement that I signed when I joined the company), and that my final paycheck is going to be deducted the replacement cost of the laptop and iPhone unless she receives the package in the way I was instructed to send it to her.

She did confirm that the package arrived, however she is refusing to open and ""accept"" it as her last name is not on the package. ""Susan"" is the only Susan in HR, and she is the head of HR. 

Susan is offering no remedy here, only keeps saying that I am out of compliance and did not follow her specific instructions.  

I am sort of at a loss on what to do here. 

Do I contact IT? The company's legal department? 

As part of my employment agreement, it does state that if I seperate from the company, and fail to return any company issued equipment, I agree to have my paycheck deducted for the cost of replacement. 

But...they have the equipment...

Our kids were staying with MIL for two weeks, as a close friend of DH’s passed away in a car accident. It was unexpected and she was the only one able to take them for such a long amount of time. 

Originally, SIL &amp; BIL would be staying for a week, then AIL would be staying for the other week. This was planned before we had to leave. 

SIL &amp; BIL ended up leaving after two days. MIL was with kiddos for 5 days alone, but they believed we were dead for 8 days. 

To break it down; 

Days 1-2: Kiddos played with cousins, all was well, many videos and pics were shared. 

Days 3-7: MIL has told kiddos that we have passed away and they will be staying with her for forever. 

Day 8: AIL arrives, notices kiddos are less excitable than usual, and inquires. MIL tells her they are missing us, which kiddos agree too (they think we’re dead). 

Day 11: AIL figures everything out after DS breaks down about never seeing us again. She tells MIL she’s taking the kids to the park and takes off, calling me after pulling over on the highway. She takes kiddos until we get home. 

Obviously we want to completely cut MiL out. DS and the girls are completely traumatized from the event. Is there any legal action we can take? We will be contacting a lawyer for a restraining order, however is there anything else we can do?

Animal control thinks based on where she found she was likely abandoned on the side of the road, as it's not close or easily accessible to any residential areas.  On Animal control's recommendation, we had them perform a necropsy . They are reasonably certain she had given birth in the past month or two, was slightly underweight from nursing but otherwise healthy.

On mobile so I hope that link posted correctly.

My husband and I got home on Tuesday night about 430PM. And found that the dog had been in its owners car all day with the back window wide open. She has a Tahoe so the window on the gate on the car was open, could have easily jumped out. We were both very upset, one we had an agreement the dog would never be back so we wouldn't press charges. And two the 10 day mandatory quarantine(that she was lucky enough to do at her home) wasn't over. It hadn't even been a week! So my husband called animal control and went over to the neighbor's house(her employer) and ask how many german shepherds she owned. She instantly gave us this sob story about how they had some kind of inspection at their house and couldn't keep him at home that day.  He told her that animal control was on their way so she wouldn't leave. Side note: animal control had already been there because it was 93° out and she had left the dog in the car all day so one of my neighbors must have called them. Animal control gets here again and she tries arguing with them about the quarantine rules are, she thinks her car is an enclosed pen for the dog, again the gate window is wide open. The officer tells her that she is breaking quarantine and she acts like the other officer didnt tell her the""rules"", which are the dog needs to be kept in the house;if in the yard it needs to be in a completely enclosed pen, or on a leash held by the owner. And he must stay on their property. The reason I this is because the officer last Wednesday told her exactly what the rules were. She was cited and escorted home by the officer. The next morning the dog had to be quarantined af the vets office which made us very happy because clearly she isn't going to follow the rules and it's going to continue to put our child at risk, no one knows why the dog bit our child. Well we decided to get an attorney so we can sue and make her understand the gravity of the situation which I think she is oblivious to or just doesn't care clearly. We weren't even going to make her pay the medical bill if she just followed the rules and honored our gentleman's agreement.

Update on the 3 year olds condition: she had bad diarrhea even with the extra probiotic, and now has to have medicated cream for diaper rash(she was completely potty trained before this ordeal) she seems to be in better spirits but still has bruising and swelling and won't let us wipe her face without a fight because it hurts. She used to LOVE dogs and would ask to pay every dog we came up to. She now doesn't even say dog when we walk past and has no interest in petting them it breaks my heart.

Not too exciting but an update none the less.

Not long after the original post I ended up sending an email to my landlord with a copy of the letter from the HOA and explained my situation. The next day I received a phone call from my landlord and she said not to worry about it. According to her despite my lease stating that the ""Tenant agrees to abide by any applicable owners association regulations as they now exist or may be amended."" this was a rather unreasonable demand by the HOA and isn't something that should be held against me or any other tenants she has in the neighborhood. She said she would take care of the situation with the HOA and offered to pay any fines that resulted in the meantime.

A few days ago I had an AC guy out to do a quote on installing an AC unit. He was exploring my attic and found a room that I didn't know existed. In the room was a massive porn stash. Just boxes and boxes of late 90s porn magazines, thousands of pages erotica, a lot of printed out cartoon porn, and file folders with printed out porn and ripped out pages from porn magazines in them. In one of those folders I found some legit child porn.

I want to report this to the police but was wondering if I could get in any trouble for it.

twentyninethrowaways,2018-06-03 12:12:15+00:00,UPDATE: My Landlord has 'revoked' permission to hospice at home. Wtf do i do.,"Because I know you lovable assholes are all about the updates...and seriously, thanks for all the kindness on my post.  You all helped break the cycle of panic.

Original:  https://old.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8nxple/colorado_my_landlord_has_revoked_permission_for/

Turns out it wasn't my landlord at all.  It was my roommate SAYING my landlord had said I couldn't hospice there.

Yeah.  I know.

i specifically moved in with this person for this reason...with the understanding I would be dying in this house.  I'm not sure if it was malice or just idiocy but apparently she thought that 'terminally ill' was just a cutsie designation or something?  And I guess she thought it wouldn't actually happen.  So instead of telling me six months ago, or three months ago, or three weeks ago when we met with the hospice nurse...she tells me the landlord says ""You can't do in home hospice here"".  

Obviously this is super illegal (thanks, LA!), and I call my lawyer who calls me back at noon on a fucking Saturday to say nofuckingwayisthisokayholyshit.  Lawyer wants the landlord's contact info asap so we can get moving on this immediately.

I started to get suspicious when the roommate wouldn't give me the contact info for the landlord...finally, after I threatened roommate with lawyers, roommate finally gave landlord's info to me... and I call landlord and of course the landlord had no clue what I was talking about because roommate hadn't even discussed it with her.

So yes, it is an illegal eviction and interestingly because I subtenant to the roommate and not the landlord,yes, we are going to pursue it fully.  My attorney is thrilled, my landlord didn't do anything wrong and is will hopefully be getting rid of a super shady tenant (my roommate), and my roommate will have to pay for what she did, hopefully.  Everybody wins?  

Except I still gotta die, yo.  After I move lol.  At least I can afford it I guess.  :(

Expensive_Type,2018-06-01 21:08:09+00:00,UPDATE: I snooped through my mother's personal belongings and I was able to find a name. Bad news: Mom found out and she told me to move out.,"MI:
This is my [last](https://old.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8lyud3/mi_where_to_begin_to_find_my_biological_father_i/) post.

Memorial weekend, my mom and my grandma went out and didn't come back until Tuesday. I decided to use that time to search through their personal belongings. 

Since she was 15, my mom has kept a personal journal where she just talks about what happened in her life and how she feels. She used to see a therapist when she was around the same age (15) and the therapist recommended keeping a diary and she has kept one since. 

Out of respect, I have never looked through her personal belongings but honestly, I'm tired of her antics. I looked through her journal(s) and I found a few entries that were relevant to my situation.

As expected, my mom was lying. She dated my father for four months, they had a nasty breakup, and in retaliation she decided to keep  her pregnancy completely secret and cut all contact from him. I was able to find a name and there is one picture of them together. I also found out what he majored in and the entry confirmed what college he went to (the same one as my mother).

I took a picture on my phone of the journal entries and the picture of them together and stored them in a flashdrive for safe-keeping.

Unfortunately, my mom found out that I had searched through her personal belongings. I was a bit careless. 

She was very angry with me and told me that I have to pack my things and move out by Sunday. My grandmother is supporting her and she is also very angry with me.

Fortunately, they cannot legally kick me out until I turn 18. I guess they could try and physically remove me but I'm 8 inches taller than them and if they try anything, I won't hesitate to call the cops. I'm seriously sick of their shit. I already made it clear I will move out after I graduate and they won't ever see me again.

The good news is that I have a name for my father. I did some basic searching online and there are a ton of results. When I get more time, I plan on going through every search result for his name and narrowing down the list using the information I know. Once I narrow it down, I will contact my potential father and try and confirm paternity. I will also try contacting the Alumni Association of the college my father went to and see if I can get in touch with him like that. If that doesn't work, I will go to some DNA service like ""use23andme"" and try to find some family members from there.

I'm also going to try and reach out to my uncle and aunt (mom's side). I haven't seen them since I was a kid but that's because they despise my mom and grandma. I hope they don't hate me too but its worth a shot.

My optimistic goal is that I want to find out who my father is and confirm paternity and hopefully meet him before May 1st of 2019. I want to find him by that date because that is when I have to accept admission to a college. I plan on applying to a ton of colleges (hopefully I can get into an Ivy) and if I can find my dad, perhaps, I can attend a college closer to him.

I hope he's a good person, or at the very least, I hope he's alive. My mom's account of things were not very good but she's not a good person and I don't really trust her retelling of events. Either way, I just want to know who he is and even if he isn't a great person, I have a whole new family and I would honestly love to know them.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8nvhii/update_i_snooped_through_my_mothers_personal/,legaladvice,1565,1,0.0
Ghetto_Moose,2018-06-01 11:41:38+00:00,[RI]Wife paid $150.00 in copays for multiple visits to a doctor and xrays and was told she was fine. She went to get a second opinion and the doctor identified 3 different fractured areas in her leg/foot in less than 20 minutes. Is a refund possible from the first doctors office?,"She had fallen while hiking last month and for the first week she was in severe pain so went to an urgent care.  At the urgent care they took xrays and said everything was fine.  A week goes on and she is still in severe pain so I booked her an appointment at an orthopedic specialist.  Her first appointment she waited 2 hours and got an xray that he looked at for ~1 minute before telling her there was nothing wrong and just to take 'epsom salt baths' for her foot which was pretty bruised.  A week later she went for a followup with him and again she waited for 2 hours for him to see her for ~2 minutes and he said everything was looking better and she should be fine to get back to hiking.

For the next week she tried walking  bit with me but she was really in pain still and my wife is really fucking tough when it comes to pain tolerance so I got her an appointment at a second specialist.  She not only got in right away but the Doctor sat with her for about 20 minutes asking her 100 questions about the incident while she had new xrays taken and when he got the xrays back he found and showed my wife all the fractures in her leg/foot.

So basically my wife ended up walking on a broken leg/foot for 2weeks+ because one doctor completely misdiagnosed her twice because his office seemed to be really busy/overbooked.  Is there a way to contact my insurance company or this guys' office and have a valid case for a refund here?  Or is this one of those cases that you pay for their opinion regardless of how accurate it is?",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8nr7qi/riwife_paid_15000_in_copays_for_multiple_visits/,legaladvice,3412,144,0.0

A little backstory, I was told by the police officers who took me to the hospital that they were doing a two hour evaluation and would determine if I needed to be held.

I was never evaluated, nor was I seen by a psychologist until the next day and only for five minutes. 

My first encounter with a professional there was the hospital finance lady. She handed me a page and asked me to sign. The page had ""5/9"" at the bottom with no other pages, so I asked for the rest.

She left and, after some time, gave me the rest of the pages. I read them and did not want to sign because they had a clause about me being financially responsible for all fees incurred. I let the lady know and she told me they would not start the 72 hour hold until I signed, so I did. I'm not sure if that's legal.

I was later sent a bill for over $17,000 from the hospital. I received another bill for the two psych doctor I saw. Combined, they spent 15 minutes with me, I was billed for an 1 hour for each. The bill was for over $2,500.

To summarize: I'm being grossly overcharged and I did not have insurance at the time. I also am clueless if telling me they would hold me until I signed.

Do I have any legal recourse?

Personal note: I'm aware that what I tried to do was selfish and wrong. I know that there are consequences to my actions and that I rely too much on doctors when I should be fixing my issues myself.

https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7qb1sh/tx_hooked_up_with_a_girl_on_tinder_and_it_turned/

I was not going to post the update as it was clear that things were going to go legally south for my fiance's mother, yes fiance now, real fast. 

It took a single phone call to a lawyer to confirm to me that the likelihood of me being convicted of a criminal offense was basically close to zero. He stated that the mother could possibly lie to the police and have my life destroyed though. He suggested I get on top of that asap. 

Thanks to some suggestions in the comments of the last thread, I asked my fiance about the taxes. That was when I learned about the tax fraud. 

Her mom has been claiming her on her on her taxes illegally and had been receiving her daughter's tax refund as well. All the while doing fuck all with her guardianship. After 2-3 weeks of conversations between her mom, me, and my fiance it was clear that her mom had no clue the kind of legal issues she could have been facing. She also gave up on the whole rape charges pretty quick.

After many long conversations, we got her to drop the act and at least talk to a tax lawyer. The one she chose just so happened to be in the same firm as criminal defense attorneys.  

Fast forward a few months and the IRS had been contacted. So far no criminal charges had been planned yet. The reality of it was, she was probably going to face some kind of legal trouble with the irs, but for now they were not bringing down the hammer just yet as she was cooperating. The stress of the situation sent the mom to a psychiatrist for a ""flare of depression.""  She was prescribed Valium. 

Two weeks ago she bit off half of her tooth. She went to the dentist for a root canal. She was prescribed vicodin. Apparently she forgot, or decided not to, tell her dentist she was on valium. 

Everyone who read that and just went ""uhh that's not good."" Yup. 

Five days ago she took the last of her vicodin, her valium, and decided to have a drink. That black label whiskey everyone knows and loves. Two shots in and she lost consciousness. 

We found the body two days ago when we decided to pay an in person visit. We thought she was ignoring my fiance again. 

This is not the way I wanted this to end, but it is the ending to this shitty saga. Thanks to everyone in the last thread. If not for your suggestions we would never have thought to check the IRS issues. Also the guardianship is obviously gone. That unfortunately expired with her mother. 

TL:DR My soon to be mother in law was facing possible tax fraud charges from the irs. She was prescribed valium for depression. She broke a tooth in half and was prescribed vicodin after the root canal. She took both with a whiskey chaser and died.

tigscat,2018-05-28 16:24:32+00:00,She lied about her age,"Throwaway, for obvious reasons. Recently I met a girl on a dating app that said she was 18 and from South Carolina (the age of consent is 16 in SC). I am 26. While I realize this makes me a creep I was just looking for someone to talk to with no intention of ever meeting her or even making sexual advances. We're talking for about a week, each night her insisting on me sending her a picture, a selfie or a picture of the cat, whatever. I oblige her, having her return pictures of the same nature. Until one night she doesn't beat around the bush and asks for a full nude picture of me, I hesitate and refuse. She then sends me two pictures, one of her in her bra and panties, and one of her sitting in front of a mirror, revealing nothing. Having a few drinks in me, I give in, send the picture, end of conversation for a few days. 

I thought that was the end of that, no big deal. A few days later I get a call from a man claiming to be her father. He found the phone, shes 16, and he is wanting to press charges (idk what type of charges, he did not elaborate) and that he has been in contact with a private investigator. Furthermore, unless I agree to help pay for a hospital bill their daughter now has and pay money out of court, he says he will have no choice but to file charges. 

What kind of legal charges could i be facing? I should mention that i live in a state that is on the west coast, far from SC. Should I have a lawyer yet? Or entertain the thought of paying out of court?

I'm back after 6 months.,"You can read my old post here: [[Florida]: Parents hired people to kidnap me. My brother ended up pointing a gun at them. What do I need to do to get emancipated?](https://old.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7478b8/florida_parents_hired_people_to_kidnap_me_my/?utm_content=title&amp;utm_medium=front&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=legaladvice)

I sadly don't have any good news. Just two weeks after posting that my parents ended up sending me to a camp. The camp that they sent me to was using the same property and facilities of an older camp which was closed down due to abuse of teenagers.

The place wasn't like anything I imagined it would be. I tried to cooperate and pretend everything is normal but they see compliance as a form of resistance. They also see non-compliance as a form of resistance. Whatever you do they see it as resistance. Their formula is that we were defective people and the only way to fix us is to first break us down completely and then rebuild according to their standards.

Until they see you have mental breakdowns they don't agree that you're ready to relearn everything and change, so they continue the pressure. Even when I was doing everything they wanted they weren't convinced. It took maybe 3 months for them to be convinced that I'm broken down and they did break my spirit to be honest. I got to the point that I didn't care about anything anymore, I just wanted it to end.

They knew about my YouTube channel and they wanted me to login and delete all my videos and delete the channel. They had a girl who pretended to work in the kitchens to befriend me only to see if I truly hate my old self or not. She'd tell me that she watched my videos and she was insulting me left and right and was saying horrible things about me and my brother (also YouTuber) and I was supposed to agree with her, if I took things personally they knew I was acting and wasn't ready.

They got me when I was at my lowest and they got me to log them into the account. The next day they brought me in front of a computer and showed me that my old password wasn't working anymore and told me that they've deleted my account. I was thinking all the time and effort I placed there was gone.

From there I didn't care anymore and they were convinced they've achieved their goal. So things became easier. They'd teach me to be a nice girly Christian girl who wants to raise babies and would never touch a boy until she is married to someone her parents pick. It was like they were sending me into a children's book. Then my dad came and brought me back home.

When I got back my brother actually told me that my YouTube account wasn't deleted. Since I was using his email for recovery he got a notification when I logged in from the camp because it was a new place. So he figured this isn't good news and jumped and changed the password. So my account is intact. The assholes at the camp were lying.

I don't know if I'm the same person or not or how much I've changed but I really hate my parents. I hate them to much that a year ago I couldn't even imagine such a level of hatred is possible. There are 448 days until I'm 18 and I'm counting every single day until this is over and then I'm leaving with my brother and we're never looking back.

My big brother is the only positive thing in my life and the only person who I trust. When I was gone he went to police, CPS, even talked to a PI to find a way to get me back but nothing worked. My parents came after my $15,000 which I had at a joint account with my brother in order to pay for this program that they sent me to. But my brother actually ended up moving the money to an account only under his own name so parents couldn't access it. He continued to post the videos that I had prepared in the pipeline when I was gone so I continued to make more money and didn't lose subscribers.

That's it for me. From what I understand my parents couldn't afford to keep me there anymore that's why they pulled me out otherwise the place wanted more time with me. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8mkzt2/update_parents_who_hired_people_to_kidnap_me/,legaladvice,28250,3,2.0
dasheeown,2018-05-27 04:03:20+00:00,[NJ] Airport parking service used my car several times during the week I left it there,"To start off, this company isn't associated with airport, it's a completely separate third party.  I've used this company before when flying out of Newark International airport and it seemed like a decent company to use.  Reasonable prices, no issues with my car when I returned, no extra miles and the reviews were decent (at least they used to be)

So the full story is:
I dropped my car off Monday morning this past week and took their shuttle over to the airport.  The lot you drop your car off is not where the car will stay, and I'm well aware they will have to drive my car to the actual long term lot and back when I return.  Dash cam footage from my car shows a, respectable, employee take my car from the lot and drive it straight to long term parking.  No detours, no speeding, parked nicely, I was happy with that.  I can even see him leaving my vehicle after locking and checking the door.

Scrolling through my dash cam footage, I notice something odd.  While my car is equipped with a parking power box for the cam that allows it to draw from the battery as long as it's above a certain voltage, it only lasted until late Monday night.  On Tuesday after noon, a video clip showing my car, now completely moved to a different spot, and a man leaving my car with my key in hand and locking it.  My dash cam starts within about 15-20 seconds, so the driver most certainly disconnected the camera power before starting the car, and then plugged it back in after turning off the car, assuming it would no longer have power.  A few hours later on Tuesday, more footage shows up of a different person, however this man simply needed to move my car to consolidate spaces and afterward took note of where my car was now located.  The latter use of my car I have no issue with and the entire move was caught on camera, so I felt more comfortable with it and that my camera was still functioning.

The employee that disconnected my camera proceeded to do this three more times during the week with my car.  While I have no idea where he went or why, I'm confident he left the lot to do whatever he pleased.

On the day I flew back (Friday), this same employee starts my car at around 8:30AM.  This time he neglected to turn my camera off and I see his entire ride.  He does not proceed directly to the lot where I am picking up my car later that day.  Instead, he's seen making multiple stops wherever he pleased.  If anyone is unfamiliar with the area, Newark/Elizabeth NJ is not a very nice area.  The places this person was taking my car were places I would never drive through, let alone stop.  The camera catches him leaving my car at every location until the last one, where he stops on the side of the road, someone gets in the passenger seat, they sit for 5-6 minutes and the passenger gets out.  I cannot hear what they are saying because the radio is blasting on a station I never listen to.  Only at this point does he proceed back to the location where I will eventually pick up my car.  This ""trip"" of his takes about 35 minutes, wasting my gas, doing god knows what with my car.

The only reason I bothered to look at the footage was because my car showed am additional 15 miles, my seat had been completely lowered and laid back, the AC was blasting on full and the radio was at 100% on a rap radio station.

My car was not damaged during this time, at least not that I can see.  However, my dash cam measures speed, along with video, and the driver is speeding at 20-35 MPH over posted limits, along with tailgating, blowing stop signs and is even seen making an illegal u-turn at one time.

I called the company, only to receive a nasty conversation.  I was told it's impossible that my car was taken out without my permission, but when I told them I had video of it, they said ""call the police"" and hung up.  I called the police and they referred me to civil court, without actually taking a formal complaint first.

He knows I can’t see without my glasses and he knows I like my iPad so I followed him (it took me a minute or two to get the 10steps to his room becuase I was walking slowly) then when I got to his door he started yelling and me and we got into a verbal argument, the he shoved me backwards and i almsot fell down our stairs. (We have a railing and I was outside his door and I almsot flipped over the railing) I scratched my arm and it started to bleed a bit. Then he threw my glasses at me hit my face with them. I then told him that if he didn’t give my iPad back I would not be happy, he laughed and said good for you. Then he whipped the iPad at my face. I ducked and then he shoved me onto the floor hard, I banged my head against he railing hard and he started chocking me, then my dog ran up and growled at him, my brother then tried to kick my dog. I got scared and told him to lay off my dog. My brother is 18 and I’m 16 so 8t was hard norm to feel scared. At that moment my dad came up and pulled him off of me and told him he should watch it.

NiceCantaloupe,2018-05-26 20:03:47+00:00,(NY) Bikini Wax Gone Wrong," Slightly embarrassing story but also seriously in need of advice.

In preparation for summer vacation my wife went to get a bikini wax. We don’t want to name the studio, but it is a supposedly highly recommended, fancy business with multiple locations. An hour later she calls me crying saying that something terrible happened. Somehow, the person performing the waxing tore a 4 cm long 1 cm wide gash in her skin, \(between her outer and inner labia\). A lot of blood and a lot of pain. I urged her to contact her doctor's office who sent her on to the ER. End result: 9 stitches by a specialist plastic surgeon.

We were planning on leaving on vacation tomorrow and probably still will \(it’s a family reunion, my wife is adamant about going\) but there will be no going in the ocean or the pool and very limited physical activity in general. 

The lady performing the waxing was very apologetic and shocked, she stopped the treatment, my wife left without paying and they said management would reach out ASAP etc.

What do we do now? It was obvious \(the doctor said as much\) that we will get a hefty bill \(plastic surgeons are out of network\) in the mail. We have insurance, but it is pretty basic and I'm assuming we will hit our deductible/maximum by the sounds of it. I would guess that the studio would eat any medical charges without much complaint but do we need to take legal action? If so, how does one go about finding a good lawyer \(what kind?\)? We are very much novices to both medical expenses and any kind of legal matters.

We have little interest in ruining this business but obviously this is going to be expensive and put a serious damper on a week of vacation time we’ve been looking forward to for a long time. 

Very thankful for any advice. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8mcocj/ny_bikini_wax_gone_wrong/,legaladvice,1153,135,0.0
dl1998,2018-05-26 18:10:32+00:00,Caught private investigator twice [PA],"Hello a little back story about this situation: 

About a month or two ago, my sister was followed by a car. She noticed the same exact car would take off at the same time as when she would. They would meet at the same destination more than five times she said. She called the cops and the cops said they'll look into it. (We didn't know it was a private investigator at this moment)

Today, my mom and sister went out to go run some errands. My sister spotted the exact same car sitting near our house. She drove past the car and the car began to follow her. My sister and mom wanted to make sure it was someone that was following them, so they drove around and the same car was still behind them. My mom had the idea to call the cops and meet them in a cul de sac. Once in the cul de sac, the following car stopped because he knew something was up. 3 police cars came and talked to my family and the private investigator. The cops were only allowed to tell us that he is legally allowed to follow us and did not give us any details besides: the person might be following us for insurance claims or because we did not pay for our car payments.

Overall, the cops weren't very helpful, in fact they chuckled about how the private investigator was spotted twice. 

This is where our family is confused: 

1.We have no insurance claims at all
2. We paid all three of our cars in cash at the dealership. 

If someone can give me any advice on what to do, that would be great.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8mbxmd/caught_private_investigator_twice_pa/,legaladvice,1549,159,0.0

I dated who i thought was the love of my life for a over a year, and he moved into my flat. There were a few red flags of weirdness such as controlling and jealous behaviour, however he was well known and well liked by pretty much everyone in the town I live.  We were in a very public relationship. One day theres a newspaper article stating that he had been jailed that day for child porn( apparently most of it category A with videos the whole lot). Obviously my whole life fell apart in one day. He had been on bail the whole time, sinnce before he met me, and knew he was going to jail,got into a relationship with me, moved into my home and i had NO idea. Is there any legal aspect I can look at for this guy withholding this information and making my life from then on absolute hell? I'm walking around feeling like I have a target on my back because I guess people will suspect I knew about this the whole time. Its affected my job, my mind and I've been struggling with major depression and anxiety. Is there any way I can get the court proceedings from that day to even begin to understand what he actually done? I'm in a very weird state of limbo where I just know nothing apart from what the news etc reported. I know very very little about any aspects of Law or court information. I know theres probably nothing I can do but I just feel like he'll get out of jail and move on with his life and have no ramifications for what he done to me. In terms of him being in my flat, alone with access to my computers etc, is this something I should bring up with the police? Should I ask them to check my laptops etc? Would they have contacted me already if they needed to do this? This happened a few months ago and I'm just beginning to move past the grief stage of things and into the anger and realisations of what I should actively do now.

SmooshedByTree,2018-05-24 18:01:13+00:00,Neighbor’s tree about to crush my house - town refuses to help,"**Quick summary**: A tree on an adjacent (seemingly)abandoned piece of property is in danger of causing catastrophic damage to my home. I need to know how I can legally (a) take down the tree without serious legal repercussions, or (b) go about acquiring the property so I can deal with it myself.  I live in Westchester County, New York. 

A giant oak adjacent to our property recently suffered storm damage, and as a result is now leaning precariously towards our home. A tree guy confirmed that the chances of the oak landing on us is a question of “when” and not “if”, and dubbed the tree a “widow maker”. And given that it’s located right across from the midsection of our house, when it falls it will literally cleave our home in two.

Unfortunately I can’t locate the owner of the property on which the tree lies. My town’s tax records list the owner as a woman who died in 2015. No taxes have been paid since that time, and it is unclear who inherited the property.  The deed has yet to be transferred. Given that the land in question is tiny and basically worthless, it’s no surprise that no next of kin have rushed to claim it.

When I asked the town clerk and building inspector what options I had to save my family from getting crushed, they just kinda shrugged their shoulders indifferently. 

However when I asked if I could simply hire someone to take down the tree myself, they sprung to attention, threatening me with fines and possible arrest for trespassing if I went through with it. They even warned that they would alert the town’s police to routinely drive by the property in question to make sure I haven’t illegally taken down the tree.  

Also, if I’ve learned anything from this sub, it’s that you never cut down your neighbor’s old growth trees unless you’re willing to shell out tens of thousands of dollars in replanting costs, which could happen if anyone ever decides to claim the property. 

So what are my options here? 

Even if I wanted to sue I wouldn’t know who to serve with a lawsuit. All I know is that the owner died in Manhattan, but I can’t find any information on who, if anyone, inherited the land. I have no clue as to whether she left a will or died intestate, or who her next of kin would even be. 

Given that the property’s taxes haven’t been paid in several years, some friends have suggested I wait until the town forecloses after which I purchase the land at auction.  However, those wonderful folks down at town hall made it abundantly clear that they are still “years” away from considering foreclosure. And I’m not sure that my house has years, or even months, before that giant oak finally succumbs to gravity’s will. 

We’re currently hunkered down at my in-laws house, as the wife and I decided that an enormous 60 foot sword of Damocles hovering over our head was not the healthiest environment for our children (nor is getting crushed to death by said proverbial sword/literal tree).

I have to believe that there exists *some* legal remedy for people in my situation. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

Ponyh8r,2018-05-24 14:35:07+00:00,Neighbor consistently drains pool into my yard,"I have a terrible neighbor. 
He/She/They have a salt water pool. 
They are VERY anal about the water level in it. After any storm (rain) they drain the level. It flows out of their yard directly into mine and then swamps me. 
Not a little bit either. I have a bog for a good 2-3 days afterwards (yes even in the heat of the summer). 
I have asked them not to do it. 
I have been in contact with my township/municipality/police station. 
They have done nothing. (They have sent someone out to inspect in the past-- they may have said something to the neighbor(s), but it has not stopped).
If anything the neighbor has just resorted to more nefarious methods. They have installed drainage pipework under the deck so it is less obvious they are draining it. They only do it at night now. 
Where I live it is illegal to drain the pool water into the street and therefore into the public sewer system. 
I have never seen a drainage company come out to close their pool (which means they have just drained it into my yard yearly). 
This is occurring in Pennsylvania. 
Any advice would be greatly appreciated, including the type of lawyer/attorney I should (or even if I should) be in contact with. 
I'm honestly tired of having a shallow pond in the middle of my yard.

I was sort of panicking so I don't remember a lot of it but they did give me a chance to speak and ""clarify my statement.""

Based on my new knowledge of words I explained I was a dumbass, I meant genteel which I had confused with gentle and sometimes wrote as gentile but now I know these were three separate words and I have researched their meanings and, also I have also learned about why I totally understand why one would be considered offensive if she heard that. They were sort of buying it, maybe not (there were two people, which had me worried because that's how they fire people) but I did debate that the other words I used like shy and timid are much closer in meaning to ""gentle"" or ""genteel"" (well not really but I argued it anyway) then ""gentile."" Long story short THAT seemed to make sense to them so they put a ""note"" in my file (which I never heard of, but they said is less serious than a ""notation"" or a ""strike""). 

I asked if I should apologize to the co-worker and they advised against it, and said they would speak to her and that I would temporarily be reassigned to another area of the company which is fine with me. I can't imagine what would have happened if I walked in there still ignorant and they didn't figure that out. So THANK YOU reddit people for solving the mystery and giving me a  defense, not guilty by reason of stupidity. Also in Georgia for the bot.

legaladvice88996644,2018-05-23 13:58:00+00:00,[FL] Police in full tactical gear came looking for me with guns when I haven't committed a single crime ever.,"So this happened about 2 weeks ago, I get a call from family explaining that the police came looking for me in full tactical gear, with rifles and the whole 9 yards.

To make a long story short, everyone is confused about the situation as am I.

I'm attending school at one of the state university's, but don't live on campus. I also don't have any mail sent to where I live because there's an office that sorts mail, and I'm not on the lease.

So I ended up missing the police looking for me at two locations, by shear luck.

They left a business card at one location in case anyone hears anything, and the strange part is that the officer that left the card is a Detective with SWAT/Fugitive Special Operations.

Another thing that's weird, is that the police said I had stolen a rental vehicle to Virigina which makes no sense.
I'm not even old enough to rent a car, nor have I ever rented a car. I'm too broke for that.

I'm confused because a little bit of googling and youtube shows that Fugitive Operations has to do with Immigration, and the tactical gear sounds like ERO - which are for convicted violent offenders that are getting deported.

I'm not sure what kind of lawyer to even consult for something like this, and just to be clear, I was born here, have medical records and all.

All my life I've heard that my dad didn't have his papers, and at one point he stole my sensitive identification documents. To make matters worse, we have the same name, and went no contact 4 years ago because of his abusive ways. I tried to file a report for stolen identity but couldn't because he didn't use my credit at the time. Apparently he was using my identity to drive, so I was able to file a report with Florida Highway Safety Motor Vehicles, and get my first drivers license, but no police report.

I'm not sure how to approach this situation as I'm worried about the police arresting me for something I didn't do especially in the middle of my summer classes, and I just started a new job.

Could the SWAT/Fugitive Special Operations be immigration?
And what's the correct kind of lawyer to consult on this?

Now, they have changed all of the locks and I can no longer get into my house to get my stuff. I know I need to contact the landlord and police however I'm concerned that their drug dealing can get me in trouble. What should I do?","I'm on the lease with a 'friend' and a 3rd roommate is living in our spare bedroom. Everything was peachy until 4-6 weeks ago when they decided to start selling cocaine to make ends meet. I was not ok with this for several reasons but they didn't give a shit about my opinion so they never stopped. The lease was month to month so I gave my 30 days notice shortly after I realized they weren't going to stop dealing and my last day is May 31st. 

I wanted to get out of there as fast as I could so as soon as I finished my last final for school I left (May 10th) and told them that I would be back in a few weeks to drop off the key and pick up the furniture I left there.

My son was at my house Sunday like normal and she was late picking him up. I told him to call her and see if he could just spend the night because I assumed she had been drinking. Sure enough, she answers and is very obviously drunk and slurring at a bar. I was very nice and texted her that she should not be driving herself nor him drunk and to get an uber. 

She was not having and denied over and over she had anything to drink. Eventually I told her I would call the police and she admitted to having 2 drinks. I call the cops and told them she was on her way and intoxicated. They told me to call back when she arrived. She texted me telling me she was at my house and I called 911. Her ex boyfriend was driving her. She reeked of alcohol and was very clearly well over the legal limit. I cracked the door and told her the cops were on the way and to wait outside. I closed my door again and she twisted the knob and kicked in my door before I could lock it. At this point I put my phone in my pocket. She tarts screaming and cursing me and hitting me. My son is in my bedroom with my girlfriend and is scared.

At this point I have told her repeatedly to leave my house and get out as she is hitting and scratching and kicking me and choking me. My son runs out of the bedroom and sees her on top of me and she has two handfuls of hair jerking my head back and forth. I have a huge gash on my finger that might need stitches from her scratch marks all over me. Her ex boyfriend was trying to get her to calm down and was basically on my side. After the ordeal was over he told me how sorry he was and that he knew I was in the right and he doesn’t blame me for calling the cops. 

The cops arrive and I tell them what happened. I show them my cuts and scrapes and they basically said, well it’s technically domestic violence but we are not going to do anything. They let her my son leave her and her boyfriend and she got away free even though my son spoke to the cops and told them exactly what happened. My girlfriend was in our bedroom trying to keep my son away so she didn’t see much of it. 

What can I do? I already called the Sargent and he said he is going to listen to the audio from dispatch. The cops didn’t even breathalyzer her or him and let my son go home with drunks.

The cop didn’t find any violations in the inspection, but came back to the truck and stated that I was being cited for operating my cell phone. My cell phone was on the dash, and the GPS was open to guide me to my next stop. I wasn’t ticketed, so I didn’t think it was a bit deal and didn’t attempt to argue it. I later found out that since it was on the DOT paperwork, the company I work for had to take action against me (per their rules). 

It was my first and only offense in the 16 months I had been with the company. A week or two later my boss had me sign documentation that stated I would no longer be allowed to go on deliveries as a driver or assistant, and I could not go on any truck for any reason whatsoever (we run transfer trucks to our retail stores from the warehouse). The paperwork stated this was a 12 month suspension. I fought it, but they didn’t budge. 

So I became a warehouse employee, which was a significant pay cut, but I had time with the company, my 401k was growing, and I enjoyed my delivery job. I constantly
Asked for a reduced probation and was told it was a legal liability if I was to go on deliveries again while on probation. 

Fast forward to today, saturdays we literally come in for an hour in the morning to do our work and then everyone leaves. I usually stick around for a little bit after the rest of the warehouse guys leave to make sure everything is good and something doesn’t come up where my supervisor might need help. 

It’s roughly 0630 at this point, and I’m going to be clocking out after the last of our delivery trucks leave, usually around 0645. My supervisor gets a call from our boss, and he’s demanding that I go out on deliveries. I told him I couldn’t, and wouldn’t (because it was my daughters first birthday and we were celebrating today). And after that, he told me not to come back.

I’ve never told them I couldn’t do a job that they asked me to do, I’ve always been on time and I finish whatever is asked of me. There are other employees that tell them they won’t do stuff all the time, even though they are allowed to do so and not on any sort of suspension or probation, but yet they’re job has never been threatened. 

Is there anything that I can do? This just happened a few hours ago, and HR isn’t in today so I couldn’t go talk to them. I’ve put in almost two years with this company and have glowing performance reviews to back up my claims of being a solid employee.

After frisking me a second time, he told me he would get me a business card and went to his vehicle. He proceeded to pull out a Walgreens receipt and put his name and phone number on it, handing it to me and saying things like ""Your passenger is a crack head."" 

He then demanded to know where we were going, and I said I wouldn't know until we started the trip. He asked again, and my passenger revealed the bar he was going to.

I showed him the receipt he'd given me, and he cursed at me for not having the card. At last he revealed a murder had taken place a couple days ago and said lots of cops were out tonight looking for a suspect. 

Then, he told us to leave. 

I don't know my state's specific laws, but did he overstep with frisking me and reaching into my pockets, asking if I had drugs or weapons on me?

makhno,2018-05-17 22:40:27+00:00,Can landlord evict me if I'm on vacation but haven't violated the lease?,"Here's the situation:

WA state.

I signed a 1 year lease that is up in July. I spoke with my landlord in April saying I wanted to extend my lease as I would be out of town June through mid July. 

He agreed, saying that after my lease is up July 1st, it becomes month to month and: ""and will not be terminated without 90 days notice unless Tenant conduct violates the terms of the lease"". I pay rent on time, never missed a payment, etc, I should be good to at least October 1st then afaik.

Here is the issue though. The landlord has a 1 year lease with the owners that expires on July 1st. I just found this out. It sounds like he is considering walking away from being a landlord as he is having personal conflicts with some of the other tenants. Ie, it's too frustrating for him etc.

So if HIS lease is up July 1st, then what the hell happens? My lease is SUPPOSED to go to October 1st, but how can I even verify that I can stay if I don't know if he is renewing his lease? The whole fact of him having a lease or not is black box, I have no idea what he signed with the owner!

So what legal recourse do I have here? Assuming the worst, we are evicted July 1st, my room is locked, can they hire a locksmith and throw all my stuff out on the street? While I'm on vacation?

Clearly I'm in full panic mode as it appears I have to find a new place to live in the next week, before I leave for my trip, or I'm coming home to find my literal $30k worth of personal possessions thrown out on the sidewalk to be picked over for two weeks until I get back.

What the hell do I do?

Thanks!

First time posting to reddit, so I’m sorry if it is formatted incorrectly. I am currently a high school senior, graduating next Thursday. We are going on our senior trip tomorrow and I had to sign a paper listing all of my prescription medications and why I take them and I had to sign permission to the school to carry and administer them to me while we are on our trip. My school counselor (F/40s) has some issues with me (we are in a predominantly religious areas, no premarital sex etc) and she openly admits that she does not like me very much. I am a legal adult completely capable of administering my own medications, one of which is a birth control that I take to regulate my period, so I don’t even use it as protection against pregnancy as I am NOT sexually active. However, my counselor has told me that I will not be needing this medication on my trip as I should not be having sex anyway, so she will be withholding it from me on the trip. Do I have any grounds here? As a school trip, does she have the right to do this or even hold my medication since I am an adult? Or do I have to comply? I have a feeling this is unethical, especially since she is withholding a medication I need because she is prejudiced against me taking it in the first place, but I’m not sure if I have a choice.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8jyd0u/school_counselor_is_withholding_birth_control/,legaladvice,1888,96,0.0

Tl;dr of previous post\- My next door neighbor is absolutely convinced I have a pet bird and has made complaints to the HOA, animal control, and the police because my supposed pet bird is so loud it is causing emotional distress.

I got another complaint from the head guy running the HOA that my \(now multiple\) birds are causing severe emotional distress to my neighbors and their children, who can't sleep at night because of my ""flock"" of birds. The wife sent a recording to him as proof of my bird\(s\), and to tell him to tell me my smoke alarm is also beeping and needs the batteries replaced because they can hear it from their unit as well. 

Now, you can clearly hear a smoke alarm beeping, as well as birds chirping on the recording. However, the beeping is coming from their unit, as I can faintly hear it if I press my ear to the shared wall. And the birds that are supposedly my pets? The ones that are so loud that their whole household can't sleep and it's causing severe emotional distress? THOSE ARE THE BIRDS OUTSIDE. IT'S LITERALLY THE CHIRPING OF THE BIRDS OUTSIDE THEY'RE HEARING. Now, I'm no Disney princess, so I have no effect on wild birds\- or imaginary pet birds\- for that matter. I mean, my singing is so terrible it actually scares them away.  And I'm not sure how any person that is not a complete moron would mistake ordinary bird chirping for ""a flock of loud, abused rain forest birds"".

I've sent a letter to the HOA telling them to kindly pound sand and stop harassing me over the wild birds that I have no control over. I'm also going to record the birds from my porch and from inside the condo so if they say I have birds again I can prove that it's just ordinary outside birds making reasonable outside bird noises.  I'm looking into get a bird feeder as well, because it's allowed by the HOA covenants and fuck these people for being utter imbeciles and blaming me for the natural behaviour of wild animals. 

Now I'm just going to sit and wait for the next problem they have with me,  because I don't think these nitwits will take kindly to being proven wrong over something so stupid.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8jvfic/update_ga_just_moved_into_a_condo_neighbor_is/,legaladvice,16244,2,0.0
tossawaythanks,2018-05-16 04:33:19+00:00,"[IDAHO] My previous employer threatened to fire my mother if I accepted a job offer from a competitor. I accepted the competitor’s offer and they terminated my mother, as promised.","My mother and I worked at the same company.  I was there for 11 years, and she was there 3-days-short of 10 years.  At the end of March 2018, I was approached by a new competing company and presented with a generous offer.  I notified my employer of the offer and their initial reaction was surprising.  They offered to promote me to General Manager, nearly double my salary and double my company-match retirement contribution percentage, and send my son and me on a 4-day all-expenses-paid vacation to Disneyland.  They also said they wanted to draft a contract to initiate a 5-year buyout of the company.  

In the same conversation, they told me that if I were to accept the competitor’s offer that my mother’s job would ‘be in jeopardy’.  I have this conversation recorded and the audio is clear as day.  (Idaho is a one-party consent state for audio recordings, so the recording I have is admissible, if needed.)  After hearing the threat of firing my mother if I were to accept the other company’s offer, it solidified my decision to leave this company and pursue the new opportunity.  I then told the old employer I was taking the other offer and I continued working for 3 days to help them with the transition.  At the end of the 3rd day, we mutually parted ways.  

Fast forward about 5 weeks, to last Friday.  I bought my mother a plane ticket a couple weeks previous, to go visit my sister and her children, as a Mother’s Day present.  She put in her request for vacation time which was approved, and she was set to depart last Friday after work.  Because she was coming up on her 10-year anniversary she scheduled an annual review for an increase in salary.  (It had been 3 years since her last raise.)  The employer scheduled her review for last Friday at 2:00, just an hour before she was scheduled to leave work to catch her flight.  As soon as she sat down, they told her that they were severing their ties with her and that she should enjoy her vacation and take that time to process what just happened.  (Under my advice, she recorded this conversation.)  They handed her a final paycheck, and an additional check equal to one week of her pay for ‘unused paid time off’.  (She has not deposited either of these checks.)  The employer then said they knew that she “had to leave at 3:00 to catch her flight, so take the next 45 minutes and clear out your desk.”  

I understand that Idaho is an at-will employment state, but there is something here that just doesn’t sit right with me.  For reference, my mother just turned 58 years old.  Also, my mother is in the middle of a worker’s compensation claim for an injury that occurred at work a little over a year ago.

PovaghAllHumans,2018-05-14 01:32:43+00:00,Tree service cut down trees without my permission,"For context, I live in GA. 
TL;DR: Tree service cut down stuff without my permission. What are our rights/recourse?

Details:

3 weeks ago I asked a tree service if they could provide a quote to cut down a few small trees in my backyard, Akon with a large tree. I never set a date, never agreed to any work, just met with them for 5 minutes to point out the trees and then asked them to leave a quote in my mailbox and I would call them if we decided to use them. 

Get home. See a quote. Seems a little high, so I’m getting a few other quotes. 

Come home this past Monday early from work, and I see several large trucks and equipment from the tree company in front of my house. I look into my backyard from my truck window and see them cutting away. I go running down the side yard yelling at them to stop and asking what the hell theyre doing. 

Job foreman (not the same person I spoke to before) says they’re doing what I told them. I tell him I never agreed to any services, and my wife had even decided against cutting some of the pines down because she liked the wooded appearance it gave our lot. Tell him to immediately stop, and one of their guys goes running to the backyard yelling for everyone to stop. 

Go inside, grab the quote, show him how it wasn’t signed. He gets the owner (person I spoke with before) on the phone and I immediately ask why he came out to my home and just did work I never agreed to him doing. Emphasized that all I asked for was a quote. 

He seems flustered, says he doesn’t know how it happened, he’s really sorry. This cycle repeats for about 10 minutes on how this has never happened and he doesn’t know why he put me down if I didn’t sign anything or agree to it. Conversation ends with his crew cleaning up, leaving, and him agreeing to meet us at our home that evening. 

Wife comes home and cries for a good bit because now we can see clear back to the large road behind us, and about half of the pine trees she loved are gone. For reference, there were about 12 total and they were each 12-18 years old, about 30-45ft tall. 

Guy arrives. Initially tries to make it sound like it’s on both of us that it happened, to which I made clear it was 100% on them, and they need to fix it. To make matters worse, they just toppled the trees off onto the hill behind my fence, which runs down towards a public access hiking trail. I don’t own the land that the trees are now on, and it’s illegal for me to dump them there. 

My wife and I only had about 30 min before he showed up from the time she got off work, so we didn’t have a lot of time to figure out a solution. 
What we came to agreement on verbally, and loosely, is that we pay nothing, he cleans up the cut down trees, and he plants a new row of fat growing evergreens like my wife loved in place. He then leaves and says he’ll call to set a date, which he set for the end of this next week. 

However, the more my wife and I think about it, the more I feel like this isn’t a fair shake. It’ll take another 10-12 years for us to get even part of the wooded appearance back that our lot had before, and that was one of the primary reasons we bought the house. 

As a final note, all of this was caught on the security system on my house, and I recorded the conversation we had with the owner when he arrived. 

My questions are this:
1. Is this a fair trade?
2. What are our rights or what we’re owed legally? Are these trees or their aesthetic appearance to us worth anything legally?
3. Should I consult an attorney, and if so, what kind of an attorney do I call?
4. Should I cancel the cleanup appointment we have with the company until I consult an attorney? 

I’m not trying to make this a payday, I just want to make sure they do what’s right by us, and it especially has me riled up how much this upset my wife. She’s cried a few times since then when she’s looked at the backyard because of it too. It was always her dream to live on a wooded lot like her parents did to the point of it being a “veto” issue when we were looking for a house.

justmyluck_tw,2018-05-14 00:34:55+00:00,[TX] Can the university compel me to pay back a SCHOLARSHIP they paid me by mistake after I graduated?,"Hello! **TL;DR I graduated in December 2017 with no student loans thanks to some amazing scholarships. The school has now contacted me saying they gave me $5,000 worth of scholarships by mistake and now I owe it back. Do I have any chance of fighting the charge?**

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Every year of college, I submitted a university application for scholarships in January. I'd gotten some decent scholarships through the program, and while they never completely covered tuition, they helped a lot. In July 2017, I got an email saying I was being considered for a specific scholarship, they asked for proof of being employed, and I provided the information. Soon after, I was contacted again; I only was only registered for 11 hours, and needed 12 to be considered full-time and thus eligible. I explained that I was graduating in December, so I was exempt from any full-time requirements for scholarships and full time (I got this information from the scholarship office, which I'd asked this of before). 

August rolled around, and I received a notification my financial aid had been adjusted. I logged in and I had qualified for a $10,000 scholarship, sponsored by an alumnus donor!! But it was listed as $5,000 for the Fall and $5000 for the Spring, while the rest of my financial aid had already been adjusted for December graduation. 

Once school started at the end of the month, I went to the scholarship office to ask what was going to happen to the other $5,000; was I going to receive it or was it going to go to someone else? I was told that they were going to talk to the donor to see what they wanted to do. Maybe a couple of weeks later, I got another notification of adjustment, and saw that I had the entirety of the $10,000 listed for the Fall. SCORE! I got the money shortly after, and even went to two different scholarship banquets that the school threw for the donors to meet their donation's recipients for these types of scholarships (my donor never showed).

In March of this year, I had already moved across the country for a job. Between moving and living for a while without a job, I pretty much depleted the rest of the scholarship money, which I was incredibly grateful for because it meant I didn't have to go into debt. Then I got an email from the first people who contacted me about the scholarship:

&gt; ""I am following up in reference to your adjustment for the [donor] Scholarship. Scholarships &amp; Financial Aid removed the additional $5000 you received in the fall as the amount should have only been for $5000 and not $10,000. Your account should now show that you owe $5000 to the University. The balance will prevent you from obtaining any official transcript in the future if not resolved.""

I replied:

&gt; ""During my enrollment in the fall, I went to the scholarship office and spoke to someone there. At the time, I had received $5000 from the scholarship, and I asked about the other $5000. I was told that the scholarship office would contact the donors to talk about whether I would receive half of the scholarship or the full amount. Shortly afterward, the my Financial Award Offer letter was revised to include the rest of the funds, so I assume permission was received from the donors to disburse them. Please let me know if this was not the case.""

They replied:

&gt; ""It’s standard for Scholarships &amp; Financial Aid to inquire of the donors to see if you can receive the full dollar amount of your scholarship if you are graduating in the fall. However, I’m thinking what might have happened is the “auto” letter that is set up in their system might have indicated you would be receiving the full $10,000 in the fall when indeed it should have only been for $5000. If there are ever any new awards or changes to your scholarship, you will receive an email directly from me with those updates.""

I had no way of knowing that what the scholarship office said would not be correct. I went to the university this weekend for my friends' graduation and stopped by the emailer's office to talk about the issue, but the buildings were closed for graduation. I don't have $5,000 to pay this, and I feel quite robbed. Will anything happen if I don't pay it? Can it affect my credit? Is there any way I can fight it?

throwawaybcgirls,2018-05-12 17:38:54+00:00,My life may be at risk and I have a couple of questions to ask you all.,"I'll start this of by saying English is not my first language so  forgive me for any mistakes. 

Anyway, I'm a 17 year old female  living in a country in the ME (if I have to specify which country I will). Problem is i'm gay, and my parents are very likely going to kill me for that. This was made clear a couple of years ago when the school contacted them about my 'odd behavior'.  Long story short, I wasn't allowed to leave the house or use any electronic devices for months on end until they made sure I was not 'sick'. They've made it clear that they believe it brings shame to the family's name and so will have no issue killing me in an act of 'honor killing'. I am not officially out to them or anyone except for my two closest friends.

I finish my high school education next year, and I plan on running away right after I get my results (in July of 2019). I have around $10k saved up already but my question is, I have a several  pieces of land under my name that I will have legal control over after my birthday next year. Considering I'm probably leaving to the USA and I barely have any money, can I legally sell them without my father's consent and face no repercussions (eg. my father suing me for the money) I feel like this is my only choice because if I stay i'm very likely to be killed, but at the same time if I leave im probably going to end up homeless and that's not something pleasant to look forward to.

Some more information that may be relevant: I have an American passport, so I think my safest bet is to go to the USA since I don't have to worry about getting a visa or anything. I'd also like to go to university and i'm hoping I can get a scholarship to a university there, I've been talking to my math teacher and he agreed to help me look. He doesn't think getting accepted is an issue since my grades are not bad, I have an overall average of 41/42  (IB score) but I'm still very reluctant to rely completely on that.  

So what are my options here guys? Any help would be appreciated. 

Thank you in advance.

I saw a lot of people asking for updates in the comments, and a couple people sent me private messages too. I appreciated all the supportive comments, but I have to say it was really fucking creepy and terrifying the number of people trying to guess exactly where I was. Even though most of you were offering to help, I couldn’t help thinking that it was my ex’s family who had found the post and were trying to scare me. I was not going to come back at all, but this place really did help me finally get up and escape, and I figured for that service you guys were owed some kind of update. Somebody in the comments of the last post called my ex “Paul” so I’ll just use that name for sake of clarity.

**tl;dr:** I escaped, I gave the baby up for adoption, and my ex is out of my life, hopefully forever.

As for details, it all kind of happened in a blur, so I don’t know how much I’m remembering right. Basically, I called the cops from the library, a cop showed up, I told him I wanted to escape an abusive relationship but that Paul’s mom was with me and would force me to go back to him. I didn’t realize it but there were actually visible bruises on my shoulders/back that the officer could see, so he told me he’d take me to a hospital to get checked out. I asked him to take me to the hospital in the next county, because there’s only one big hospital in our area and I knew the whole family would be looking for me there. 

He told me they were going to do some kind of forensic exam at the hospital and if it was ok for them to take pictures of my bruises. He asked me how I got the bruises and about some scars I have, and he wrote down everything I said. I know I was kind of rambling, but I tried to tell him everything I could think of, from the physical abuse to the isolation stuff and the not taking me to the doctor. They had an OB come down and check me over, and she said that everything appeared to be just fine but that I should stay overnight. The cop told me before he left that he would file a report but he couldn’t promise that charges would be brought against Paul and also that he would come back the next day to take me to a local women’s shelter. Well, the stress of everything kinda overwhelmed me and I ended up going into labor that night. I know the kid survived, but I told them I didn’t want to see him and that I wanted to give him up under the safe haven law. I was surprised at how nice everyone was about it. They even moved me to a different floor afterwards. I called my uncle and he drove down right away and hired me a lawyer to deal with a lot of this stuff. I told the lawyer I only wanted to know what I absolutely had to know and that I’d sign whatever he needed, but I didn’t want to be involved if I didn’t have to. I don’t know exactly what this guy’s specialty was/is, but he’s really good. He took care of dealing with the cops and getting me a restraining order against Paul, and he was also somehow able to convince Paul to go along with the adoption. I did hear that Paul’s mom (who always hated me) also helped convince him that it wasn’t worth the trouble.

So the rest of this I only heard through gossip from the one friend I was allowed to have (I’ll call her Emily) and the few people who I managed to reconnect with in the last couple of days. I don’t know how much of it is true, and I don’t really care. It’s just nice to imagine all the cracks finally showing in his stupid eagle scout bullshit persona. Apparently, after Paul’s mom noticed I was gone from the library, she called Paul at work and they both went looking for me in town. When they didn’t find me, they went to Emily’s place to see if I was there, and when I obviously wasn’t, Paul started threatening to hurt Emily and she recorded him screaming at her. She didn’t show me the video and I didn’t ask to see it, but I do believe her. She’s also told me that she kept a diary of every time I went to her after Paul beat me, where she detailed everything I said and all the injuries I had. She even managed to sneak a few pictures. She gave all this stuff to the lawyer my uncle hired and I don’t know what he’s done with it since.

I also heard that Paul went to the local hospital (the one I didn’t want to go to) and started screaming at/harassing the staff because they wouldn’t tell him if I was there or not. I don’t know if he was arrested or anything, although I feel like he would have been? So I don’t know how much I believe that one. I do know that what he did to me is more common knowledge now because of Emily. She posted a bunch of stuff on Facebook trying to find me until I called her and told her what happened, and she mentioned some of the stuff Paul did (so that people wouldn’t contact him if they found me).

And that’s pretty much it. I don’t know if or when any kind of charges will be filed against Paul, and at this point I don’t care. I want to be done with him forever. I’m pretty sure the adoption of the kid has been finalized or at least is too far done for him to fuck it up. My uncle took me back to his place, and I’ve pretty much just been sleeping every day or hanging out on the internet. He’s going to help me get a job soon, and he wants me to go to a therapist, but I don’t know if I’m ready. I feel like I need to catch up on ten years worth of sleep, and I don't really want to leave or go anywhere I don't have to.

AsteroidMermaid,2018-05-11 14:55:01+00:00,UPDATE- I’m being named as guarantor for my stepchildren without my consent? -Colorado,"Hi LegalAdvice, 

Thank you for all your advice on my original post. I was the stepparent who carried their step kids on my insurance policies and got stuck as a financially responsible party for all their bills.

It turns out that unfortunately this was not an accident and turned out to be a lot worse than I originally thought. There were a lot of awful surprises but as it relates to my original post, after digging deeper and requesting the handwritten intake paperwork, my name has been signed all over the place at more providers than we originally thought as a financially responsible party, and my information used in conjunction with her address. 

My husband and I tried talking this out with his ex, whose reaction was to pretend she did not know me nor had ever heard of me. 

Later, after some more probing, she flipped out and declared I deserved everything I got because she’d rather them be uninsured than have a stepparent cover them. She claims she going to sue me because she claims it’s morally reprehensible for a stepparent to carry stepchildren on their insurance policies. I know nothing will come of that threat.

In short, trying to talk this out like adults just got truly bizarre. I was really hoping, even with this new knowledge, we could all work this out together outside the legal system for my step-kids’ sake but unfortunately not. I did file a police report and because of the nature of some of the erroneous claims found later, made a report with the National Insurance Crime Bureau. Nothing dramatic has happened other than receiving case numbers. This can be a very long road from what I’m told. 

I wish this had a happier ending but thank you for all your help, LA.

Dad's retrial was tonight. My folks lawyered up and dad was not put on the stand due to his cognitive capacity. My mother, myself and a neighbour all testified and after 4 hours in a court room, the new judge determined dad was not guilty! The judge said that while she did not question that the other driver truly believed my dad was the driver, she felt that we were also credible and believable and that somewhere along the line the other driver got the details mixed up in her head. She believed mine and my mother's testimony that there was no way we would ever get in a car with my dad driving and that my dad was never behind the wheel. As the court has determined my dad was not driving, there is no grounds for my mother to be charged with giving a false statement, so that will likely be dropped. 

Thanks for the advice last year, it has been a rough go but it's turned out how we hoped it would (albeit a bit more expensively).",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8ikmya/update_parents_wrongfully_charged_with_switching/,legaladvice,2126,2,0.0

Landlord doesn't pay DirectTV. I get hit with collections. Did I mention Landlord also owns local DirectTV dealer? Who do I report this to?","I moved into an apartment complex last year. The lease said all utilities were included, listing them out. I was to pay a flat fee monthly to the landlord for these. No issue with heat, electric, or water. Internet and DirectTV were also included. 

Turns out the landlord company made a change in the direct TV account, and it started accruing late fees. I was then made aware they had signed up for DirectTV under my name without my consent. So although I pay them monthly, because of a clerical error, it would appear that I didn't pay directtv. 

I am now on the line for my credit getting ruined, and having to pay the late fees. I paid my landlord on time, every month for their utilities fee. 

Now it turns out the Landlord owns another company, which is an ISP and a DirectTV MDU dealer. So it appears that they pull people in with ""all utilities"", sign tenants up for direct TV, make commission off the 30+ apartments they own monthly - all without tenants consent. They're double dipping, and I'm left with the bill.

I have no idea how to fight this. Landlords told me shove it. Can't find any info on my local county's website about who to call. The financial NYS fraud website doesn't have an option for reporting this kind of stuff.

whatthefunkmaster,2018-05-06 15:26:50+00:00,"Ontario: Getting sued for $1,000,000 because of a dog bite that occurred on my property (not even my dog)","This is happening on Ontario for context and I could really use a little advice for what is hopefully a relatively easy question.

5 defendants are listed on this lawsuit. I have just filled out form 18A (Statement of defence) from attorneygeneral.jus.gov.on. No issues there, after a brief conversation on the phone with a lawyer friend I was given some unofficial advice on how to go about that part of it.

Problem (?) is, the other defendants listed on this claim are likely going to just ignore it. I do not believe they are seeking legal council, but I know that I need to present this statement of defence to the other defendants listed on the statement of claim.

I don't even know how to get in contact with these people any more. I haven't spoken to them for well over 2 years. Frankly, I don't even know where they live any more. No phone numbers, no social media, nothing.

I believe I am supposed to keep my fax records from sending my statement to all the defendants, and submit them along with a sworn affidavit that all parties have been notified of my statement of defence, along with the copy that I submit to the  courthouse.

What the hell do I do here? I don't intend to receive further legal council in this affair, so I think it's on me to serve these people these documents. The lawsuit is a little bit absurd and I shouldn't have any trouble removing my name from the lawsuit as I was neither the owner of the property where the incident occurred or the dog that bit the person, hence my hesitation to involve lawyers that I'm going to have to pay for.

If anyone can give me some sound advice as to what I'm expected to do in this situation it would be greatly appreciated!

MrAnonymousRobot,2018-05-06 06:16:39+00:00,"I'm fairly certain I found a sexual predator while at a park today, not sure what is the right course of action.","Today my friend and I were at a local park, we arrived at the same time as another car and out of that car came 5 people, 1 older looking guy (mid 20's to early 30's) and 4 young girls (about middle school aged). We didn't think much of this other than it seemed a bit odd and continued prep for our hike. We did smell a strong odor of weed when we got out of the car and could only be coming from their vehicle the way we were parked. 

I'm a professional photographer by trade so I had my big camera with a big zoom with me. I was shooting portraits of my friend with this setup. A little into our walk I see the group again and notice that all the girls seemed to be dressed very provocative for that young age, one was in a bikini top and very short shorts (mind you, this is upstate NY and the park was high up, it was roughly 55-60˚ there so not that type of clothing weather). I also noticed that these girls seemed to be acting very strange, almost as if they were drugged (laying on the ground randomly, staring at random objects, jumping on people and things, just acting very strange and not like normal hyperactive teenagers).

At this point, I still haven't had the ability to get a good look at the guy so I still thought it was maybe a father or something of that nature... that was until we were further into the hike and saw him taking pictures of the 4 girls back sides and hugging/kissing on one of the other girls as the others take pictures of it. 

At this point, I pulled out my camera and pretended to take pictures of my friend when I was really taking shots of him and the kids, once I zoomed in he did not look like an 18 year old or father, he looked as if he was in his mid 20's to early 30's. I talked to another guy there about it and he said he noticed the same thing. A little while after hanging there a bit sneaking photos he seems to catch on, the whole time he was very suspicious of his surroundings too, always looking around to see what was going on. 

Once he catches on he quickly starts to leave but not until approaching me, the conversation went as follows:

Him: What type of camera is that?
Me: It's a Sony

At this point he is very close to me and begins to grab my camera.

Him: Can I see it?
Me: No, I can't let you do that, sorry

He now just lets go and begins to walk away, after a short distance he turns around.

Him: I hope you didn't take any pictures of me on that, right.
Me: Nope

Then he just leaves. At this point, I'm certain something is up and go into full ""I have to catch this guy mode"". In my 7 years of being a photographer, not once have I ever been approached by someone... and I shoot pictures of people with me blatantly in sight all the time, I was hiding it this time so he couldn't tell.

I trail behind him slightly and end up being able to get a picture of his license plate, it is registered in NY. He left very quickly.

I've tried contacting 2 local police stations but have been unsuccessful as it was at 9pm on a saturday, I'm going to attempt going to one tomorrow morning. 

My question for you is, is my suspicion justified and legally am I allowed to make a complaint like this?

Pretty much what the title suggests. My niece is 17. Her baby daddy is a 17 year old, turning 18 in four months. She gave birth 3 weeks ago. Prior to the birth, they broke up and he got into another relationship with another girl. She never told us this until the baby was born. When she informed him of the baby's due date again, he told her to ""fuck off"" and that he didn't want anything to do with the baby or her. So, this is basically where we're at. He fled the state for college, as we're told, and we have no idea where he went. My sister tried to get in contact with his parents, but they cursed at her and said that they didn't approve of the relationship, my niece was a whore, and that the boy had a good future, not raising some whore's baby. \(Classy.\)  In a span of four weeks, we've contacted them twice: the first time to ask them again nicely for his contact info because she was going to be induced \(ignored\), the second time was after the baby was born and we offered to let them see him. They threatened to sue us because, according to their message:

\&gt;you are harrassing \(sic\) us. Our son is a good kid. He made a mistake with getting with \(niece\). Now, \(he\) is going to college and won't be returning home until he graduates. During this time, we want no contact from any of you. He doesn't want to be with that girl or her child. HE has a future. HE IS going to college. He has so much potential and we are not going to let some little girl ruin that. \(other  things not important\) He is a minor. We  are his parents. DO not contact him again or we WILL SUE. 

\(Yes, this was literally their message.\)

My sister is freaking out about the thought of them suing, despite reassurances that they wouldn't win/had no case. Legally, what are our options? Because he is a minor we know that his parents can block contact with us, but he has a legal responsibilities to his child now.

Quick background: I work in IT Security, but have a few side jobs that I do for fun/extra money. One of those side jobs is repairing laptop computers, tablets, cell phones, etc. I also do custom PC builds for people as well.

So, the way I network is through word of mouth, and business cards. Long story short, a guy at my kickboxing academy approached me and asked if I could fix his laptop. He told me he was having performance issues, and complained that his PC freezes and blue screens with no warning.

I go through the normal routine, and have him sign a contract agreeing to pay me for my services, as well as granting me full control over the device while I carry out repairs, etc. 

He agreed, and asked that if the computer can't be fixed, at least recover his files to the best of my ability and place them on an external drive for safe keeping. 

Now, I have a big disclaimer that I have the person sign off on that literally reads as follows: ""I will respect the privacy of your data, however I will look into any area that the problems you're having may lead me to. That being said is there anything on the computer that you would not want me to see?"" if the user says yes, I tell them to clean up the computer and bring it back when its safe for me to look at. I'm not interested in looking at naked pictures of the guy or his wife, for example. This guy said no, and signed off on the disclaimer.

long story short, the laptop was an older model but I was able to get everything up and running again. However, this is where the story gets messed up. 

After running a quick virus scan on the machine, I notice over 100 malicious items being found. 80ish of which were located in ONE FOLDER. So, I crack open the folder to take a look, as a lot of people download malicious software without really knowing what they're getting into. 

Well, I found an entire series of photos and videos on the computer. I clicked one (stupidly) and saw a young girl (pre-adolescent) engaged in sexual activity with an adult. The others had similar file names, and were clearly pornographic videos and photos from what little I could see in the thumbnail. Honestly, I've never felt more sick to my stomach than I did last night when I saw that picture.

My mind is a mess right now. I couldn't sleep last night and I'm not really sure what to do. I took screen shots of the file system to prove that they were last modified/viewed BEFORE I received the computer as to not implicate myself in any way.

noreallyitstrue_,2018-05-02 01:33:44+00:00,Update: trying to close when contract obligations are not met (GA),"Hello all, I'm sorry I didn't update yesterday. It was a very long day and I literally went to bed as soon as we got home and got the kids to bed. 

Original post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8fup54/ga_closing_tomorrow_and_things_from_the_contract/)

So we showed up in the morning for the final walk through it was as we expected. Pretty much nothing was done. The contractor manager was such a jerk. He threw out every excuse in the book. It'll all get done today. That isn't my job. That's the homeowner's responsibility. Nobody told me that needed to be done. I did everything you wanted. It's not my job to know what they agreed to do for you in the contract, etc.

We had the emails with our concerns, the contract, basically all communication that stated what would be done before closing. We not so gently reminded him that as a representative of the builder, whatever he or the agent told us as representatives of the company, it's up to them to collaborate with each other to make sure it's taken care of. We also reminded him that we were not the homeowners, and would not be unless these things were taken care of. He then told us it would be our fault if we didn't close. We again told him the delay was through him, not us. 

We made him call back the kitchen guy to finish some work. the manager claimed that he was never shown what we were showing him. Even though my husband showed him in person during the first walk though, it was in the inspection report, and it was in the communication we had from the company. Whatever.

He finally caved and put in writing a list of things that still needed to be done. The realtor, who at this point mostly watched our exhanges, finally woke up and made him add more detail and everything he said he would do (he kept saying ""I don't need to write that down, I'm going to take care of that personally"". She made him write it down anyway). He also wrote down that this would all be done by next Friday, saying that it would probably all be done by tomorrow anyway.

So then we go to the lawyer's office. The way it was explained to us is that the buyer chooses and pays for the closing lawyer, but the lawyer represents both parties. I was very skeptical but I ended up being pleasantly surprised. We started by telling them the situation and that we weren't willing to close unless we got something in writing that these things would survive closing. The lawyer said that 'they don't do' escrow agreements but an amendment to the contract would be viable and enforceable. She said that at this point if we went to arbitration (there's an arbitration clause in our original contract) they wouldn't have a leg to stand on. She left the room so that she wouldn't appear to have anything to do with writing the amendment, the realtor sent it to us for us to esign and contacted the builder agent. While we were waiting to hear back, we started the closing. The lawyer told us that even if we signed everything, they would need our permission to finalize it and we could always walk away, so we started signing the paperwork.


 During this, the realtor was texting with the agents. They initially said that amendments on closing day were not allowed. Upon hearing this, our lawyer got her boss, who contacted their boss, who apologized and said that an amendment is fine.

Then the excuses started. Doing this amendment would delay closing (no duh, we've been saying this situation was going to delay closing all along). We were asking for new things (we weren't). We were surprising them (we've said for weeks that we wouldn't close if these weren't done). So we told the realtor and the lawyer we were leaving and left. Before I left I told our realtor to tell the building agent that we were not taking any more time off of work for this, so if we had to postpone this for a day, they would be responsible for doing it on our time.  At this point the realtor really started scrambling.

At this point I was going on about three hours of sleep, and we had been at this for almost 6 hours, and we had just walked away from our dream home with no plan B. But we had a special appointment to distract us. While I was lying on a table, with a wand up my hoohaa, and looking a beautiful baby heartbeat on the screen above me, my husband leaned over and whispered in my ear ""They signed"". 

Apparently after we left our realtor called the agent supervisor (the same woman the lawyer had called), and she forced them to sign the amendment. 

So that's how we got a house and a baby all in the same day. It was for sure one of the most emotionally exhausting days of my life. I really appreciate the words of wisdom I got here. Although I'm always up for a good fight, it really helped knowing that you internet strangers backed me up. I know this is a place where logic rules, but I also find that this sub is often one of the most compassionate. You helped make a very stressful situation more bearable.

Her friend also took some pictures but nothing too explicit. My mom is telling me to report it and I'm not really sure I want to. I feel like she's breaching my privacy too. I'm not a child, I'm a teenager and I can make my own decisions. 

She also told my dad about this and my dad is a little more chill. He's saying that it's fine and I agree with him, nothing bad happened. We used a condom and Ill probably get tested anyways in like 2 weeks. But my mom is super mad.

Epididymister,2018-04-27 21:03:04+00:00,[Update][PA] Neighbor kid got bit by stray cat that hangs out in our backyard and had to get rabies shots. Parents want us to pay.,"[Link to original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8bmge5/pa_neighbor_kid_got_bit_by_stray_cat_that_hangs/)

So, the mom brought over a hospital bill the next week, like they said they would. I refused to take it based on the advice I got here. She wasn't happy about it, but she took it better than I expected, and I thought maybe that would be the end of it.

Then, two days ago, we got a letter from a lawyer's office saying we have to pay the neighbors $2200 and some change or they'll sue us. I googled the name on the letterhead and they're a real law firm, but they're located in a town almost an hour away from Philly, which to me seems weird because there's tons of law offices more local. 

Also weird is that the letter says the kid was bitten by a dog rather than a cat (we don't have a dog either). At first we thought they had hired the most inattentive lawyer of all time and it was just a mistake, but then I started thinking about how people on the first thread were saying that cat bites usually don't require rabies shots, and animal control would have come to quarantine the cat until they were sure it didn't have rabies if they *were* concerned about it. Now I'm starting to wonder if maybe they really are trying to run some type of scam.

Luckily, my dad has a friend/regular customer who's a lawyer, and he said he would help us write a response letter. He said that based on what my dad told him, it doesn't sound like they have much of a case, but we're going to meet him for dinner at my parents' house Sunday and explain the whole story to him then.

Thank you everyone for all the excellent advice! If anything else noteworthy happens, I'll provide another update.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8ff0sm/updatepa_neighbor_kid_got_bit_by_stray_cat_that/,legaladvice,2999,1,0.0
legalizemavin,2018-04-27 10:51:08+00:00,(MO) Dad is trying to get custody of my siblings but if he gets it responsibility for my handicapped sister would become solely mine.,"My parents got divorced 3 years ago, I am 19 going to college and working and my mom currently has majority custody. My 2 siblings go to my dads every other weekend but I rarely go because his girlfriend doesn't like me.

My youngest sister is on the autism spectrum and will sometimes at school have outbursts at school where she strips completely naked and throws things. When this happens the school calls my mom, my mom has to take off work and go pick her up. This happens anywhere from once a month to three times a week, last week my mom was called 4 times. 

My mom has a job where the boss understands the situation very well and allows my mom to work from home on days she has to leave for these, go to IEP meetings, go to therapy appointments.

My dads job is union factory work where he can't really take off in the middle of a shift, and is unreachable while he is at work, he also would have to use sick days/ PTO for her appointments so he wouldn't be able to go to those.

My father is currently going to court to get primary custody of my sisters because while my parents were married my mom was an alcoholic and he doesn't believe she has changed. (She has, stress makes you drink Isnt that funny.) 

I asked him about my little sisters care and his job and he said that I would just have to step up and do it and be a good big sister. I'm in Pharmacy school and also work at a restaurant to help pay for it and I would not be able to leave Either of those multiple times a week when she is having outbursts.

My sisters are being represented by a guardian ad litum, but since I am not a part of this custody battle she only personally spoke with my sister who is not challenged. And I only spoke with her during her group talk with both of my parents and both of my siblings when she was first hired. So she is representing them in court to the judge.

I sent her an email about my concerns and the only reply I got was that since I wasn't one of her clients it wasn't appropriate for me to talk to her about the case. Where would I go to tell that I wouldn't be able to take on these responsibilities? 

Whenever I am free I will pickup her for my mom or drive her to school from a therapy appointment but with my dads job they would be calling me at all times of the day to get her, and with summer coming it would only be worse because she does not last in daycare for long and we have to change daycares all the time.

I am afraid that my dad will get custody because his girlfriend is a lawyer and they have a bigger house and their kids go to a better (public) school than my sisters do.

My sister is my whole world but I can't put my future on hold for her because I know that when my parents pass I will need to be making enough to support her anyways. 

EDIT

Also during their marriage my mother is the one who worked the whole 16 years while my dad only had a job for like 3 years out of it. my mom was making about 90k before she started having to take off so much time and be a single parent and change jobs.

Now she still makes a good wage (we are stable and can afford very good care for my disabled sister she has a psychiatrist and a therapist and a physical therapist and goes to really good autism things) and he makes substantially less. 

Just saying so no one thinks she is one of those moms who only has custody because she is a woman and not because she was the one who provided for us. 

EDIT 2

Question: is it legal if the school calls one parent (who's parenting time it is) and they do not respond for the other parent to be called and pick them up?

With custody how would that work? Like would he have a case for her overstepping her time boundaries to pick up my sister when it was my dads day with her? ",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8faq16/mo_dad_is_trying_to_get_custody_of_my_siblings/,legaladvice,1396,244,0.0

Dev_Jaime,2018-04-26 04:15:55+00:00,[CA] A Supervisor mis-gendering led to me losing a promotion and wages,"I am in the state of California and I work at a well known corporate security entity and am a fully-transitioned FtM (female-to-male).  My records were officially/legally changed (driver’s license, social security card, etc) including within my company’s system.  I go by a male name, male gender-markers, and pronouns.  Starting in January 2018, I was offered a promotion to Shift-Supervisor for a client site and accepted it.  Unfortunately in my first week of training at this new site, the Supervising Officer began to purposefully mis-gender me even after I told them to stop.  They told the other guards that I used to be female, etc.  When I first reported it, the Supervisor was told to apologize and cease calling me a female.  Yet this didn’t happen, and she began to call me female and then make a show of apologizing in front of other co-workers as a way to skirt what HR enforced.  When I reported it again as a concern, I was removed from the site and lost my promotion (plus the pay that went with it.)  They didn’t give me any hours for 2 weeks and it sincerely felt like I was punished to report.  The Supervisor is still at that site to this day, by the way, and received no write-ups.


After much fighting the decision, I was transferred to a new site as a regular officer and the new Site’s Supervisor (Let’s call her Supervisor B) once again began to call me a girl and tell the other guards that I am female.  Even when the others tried to correct Supervisor B, including myself, she continued, citing her religious beliefs.  She has refused to apologize and retaliated for me reporting my concern by writing me up for refusing to work off the clock.   This continued for weeks as the main office was telling me that HR was looking into it.  


I again reported my concerns this week when I was concerned about being ordered to work off the clock.  My Operations Manager stripped me of my 40 hours and once again lost  a permanent site.  Local HR when I pressed for my personnel files after I was told the present Site Supervisor wrote me up for refusing to work off the clock, told me it was against company policy to give me copies of my records.  I was told by the same HR rep that I could show some gratitude for them “accommodating” me.  Needless to say, I am now without hours again and waiting for regional HR to investigate all because I brought up that I choose to raise a concern about being mis-gendered.  Regional HR has admitted that their Site Supervisors are lacking in sensitivity training.  Is there anything I can do? Note: I was working 40 hours until I brought forward a concern and briefly mentioned the mis-gendering was continuing.

Trappedinthebackseat,2018-04-25 01:21:42+00:00,I was trapped in the backseat of a car during a traffic stop. The two people in the front seat refused to exit the car and were forced out. I was then forced out as well and suffered a serious injury.,"This happened in Dallas Texas. 

Was riding in the backseat of a 2 door car and in the front seat were two of my employees. Cops stopped us and the driver became a sov cit jackass to the officer refusing to even show his license to him. 

You can imagine how it went. What became one officer in a patrol car soon became 12 officers from 3 patrol cars, 3 SUVs, and a motorcycle cop. 

I handed my license to the officer and said I was willing to cooperate and that I would gladly exit the vehicle if I were not trapped inside. One of the officers said unless I can convince the two guys in the front seat to cooperate then I was going down with the rest. I told them that unless they cooperate now I was firing them on the spot. 

The passenger asked on what grounds. I said ""Because Texas. Because at will. But if you want the real answer, you are showing very poor judgement right now and I cant trust you as an employee."" To which one of the officers replied that he is not buying my act and that this was our last chance. 

The first officer pointed to his body camera and said he had been recording the whole time and that he has been more than fair but that time was up. He counted down from ten but had to smash the window when the driver started rolling the window up on him. 

Soon both of the passengers in front of me were dragged out of the car and the officer tried to reach back into the backseat for me. He forgot to pull the seat forward to let me out so he could not get to me. I looked to my left to see a pistol pointed at me and the officer on my side finally realized to pull the seat forward. 

I was dragged out and felt a horribly sharp pain on my left arm. On my way out a deep gash was cut onto the top area of my left arm by a sharp piece of metal on the door. 

I was wrestled to the ground and was cuffed when the police noticed the blood. I heard the officer say ""Holy shit"" and let me go after being cuffed. About 45 seconds later I heard one of them ask if I was going to cooperate. I said yes not wanting to incense them anymore than they already were. 

They stood me up and realized just how bad the cut was. It was definitely to the bone and 5 inches long along the top of my left arm. Because of the angle they could not properly treat it with my hands cuffed behind my back. 

So they called and ambulance and left me there to bleed with bandages kinda sorta placed on the wound. 

Thankfully it only took 5 minutes to get there and i was taken to the hospital. Stitches did not do the job. It was basically staples and glue for my arm. Yes I know it is not actually glue but some medical adhesive similar to super glue.

I was later informed that I was being charged with resisting arrest, assaulting a police officer, and a bunch of small shit on top of that. 

So definitely wanting to fight this, but I kind of feel that with the officer's body camera this is open and shut. I cooperated with the officers, I told them I was trapped in the back seat, I handed them my information to run, and was completely willing to cooperate. 

I have several questions. 

First, I am being told that my medical bills probably wont be covered by health insurance. Something about injuries suffered during the commission of a crime. IS this true?

Second. Would I need a lawyer for this? Spending thousands on a lawyer for what seems to be a pretty easy to fix misunderstanding seems a waste to me. 

Third. I know I cant go after the officers for my injuries. But Am I able to sue the car owner or his car insurance for the gash on my arm? Poor maintenance and an exposed sharp edge?

After reading most, if not all, of the comments in the previous post I called the Director of used car sales on his direct number (listed on their website).

Initially, he tried to give me the same spiel as the guy that called me earlier, but when I told him that he should have had an inspection done before I left and that all sales were final and AS-IS as there was no other agreement in place, he immediately changed his tone.

At that point, he told me ""they only intended to ask for my assistance in approving warranty repairs if needed"" and ""they never intended to try and cancel the transaction"" despite both him and his salesman trying to do so.

I told him I wanted a canceled copy of both checks in the transaction, a copy of their evaluation of the vehicle, and a formal apology from their dealership in the mail. He agreed, and they did indeed send a letter with all the requested information (except the apology, but I'm not going to call them back up). They have also since paid off the remainder of my original loan as agreed upon and they've had the title reissued properly.

I do not know what repairs were actually needed or done on the car, only that the dealership that serviced the car (which is different from the one I sold it to) listed ""engine checked"" and ""multi-point inspection"" to the CarFax.

FakeFather21,2018-04-23 17:02:50+00:00,[NY] Woman has come forward claiming her child is my half-brother to try to get a part of my fathers estate despite the fact it is impossible. What can I do make this woman go away or pay for this stunt?,"Using an alt because this is just ridiculous.

So here's the situation. My father passed about 2 months ago from natural causes and left everything he owned to me and my sister. His estate is worth over 5 million with almost half of that in liquid assets. His estate is still being split up now (not because me and sis are fighting or anything. The two of us are just working together to see who wants what and figuring out what to do with the rest.) But that isn't the issue here.

About a week ago a woman we'll call Stupid bitch (SB for short) contacted my fathers estate attorney claiming that she had a secret child with him and demanded he get a third of the estate. I have never met this woman or even knew she existed until then but apparently she is the daughter of someone my dad went to high-school with so it isn't out of the question at first. But here's the thing, my dad was diagnosed with testicular cancer 15 years ago and had both his testicles removed. So unless this kid is at least 14 then its impossible it's his. 

So entertaining the thought I met with SB and was surprised to find out this ""secret child"" is 9 years old and looks nothing like my father. During this meeting she demanded ""her child's share"" of my dads estate and wants 9 years of child support in cash. She claimed she would sue if he wasn't added into the will. My dad's estate lawyer said that if SB's kid passed a DNA test he would bust she refused. She claims she has a ""secret letter"" from my father acknowledging this kid as his own but refused to provide it. 
The meeting ended with my fathers estate lawyer telling her to pretty much get out until she's ready to do a DNA test and her claiming she would ""see us in court."" 

It's pretty obvious this is not my dad's kid but SB is still trying to take from us. My question is, what can I do to make her go away? What kind of legal action can I take to make her disappear from my life. If she does try to take action against me and my sister, what can I do to make sure this bitch gets what she deserves?",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8ed18t/ny_woman_has_come_forward_claiming_her_child_is/,legaladvice,2921,212,0.0

Because I never get a lunch break, I always select NO and am paid the additional 30 minutes. 

However, there was certainly some stigma associated with doing this and selecting NO lunch break at clock-out was discouraged by our nurse manager. More recently, one manager has actually said straight out: ""Fine, select NO lunch break if you want and get paid the extra half hour, but you won't be getting a raise when we do the next performance review.""

shirasu-niv,2018-04-21 23:18:39+00:00,"[Jacksonville, FL] - I was terminated from my job on Friday. Despite it being calm with only moderate emotions, I was almost Baker Acted via our HR Rep. What can I do?","A little more background.

I was brought on with a company local to Jacksonville. I was doing great at the job, but I had a feeling the entire time that the single HR rep that the company had was never too keen on me, based on statements of me ""Ruining my body"" with tattoos and piercings, along with me being an atheist and them being heavily Christian.

Fast forward to Friday. I was called into my bosses' office and advised that it ""Wasn't working out"" based on his manager's feelings on me, said HR Rep also gave her point of view for the final decision. No actual reason for termination was given, and I asked a few times flatly ""What did I do wrong, so I can improve in the future"" I just got ""It's not a good fit"" Keep in mind, I worked my ass off, built new processes and created systems they've always wanted in the short period I was there and was always on time, never missed work. So it smells fishy.

After I handed off my keys to the HR rep, I left the building to drive home, before turning around to come back to ask to pull a number from my work laptop. Which they allowed and I left to head home. Upon arriving home after paying a few bills, I was in driving in and noticed 4 Duval County squad cars parked outside my apartment, and then received a call from Clay County Sheriff's Office, advising me that they were looking for me, as the HR Rep apparently called ""Concerned"" for me. Keep in mind this woman has always been cold and rude to me. So.. weird.

The officer from Clay County explained that they would need to ""Man hunt me"" unless I made contact with the officers. I spoke with her briefly and went up and met the officers at the door to my apartment. Who began asking me questions about my mental health and told me that the HR rep stated ""He said he was going to harm himself, he has guns"" My front door was unlocked at the time due to Wag! sending a walker to walk my dogs. One of the cops stated that they thought maybe I was aiming to go for suicide by cop. I had to sit there and talk to the cops for 2 hours as they repeatedly said I would need to be committed. I managed to prove to them I was mentally sound, had no weapons, and I just needed to be there to take care of my dogs. After leaving I received notice for ""Disturbances"" from my leasing office.

Ushouldknowthat,2018-04-21 10:36:30+00:00,Pro-Life Group at 15 yr old's public school sex ed class - PA,"There is a lot to unpack here so please bear with me!

A few months ago, a Pro-Life group came to speak to my 15 yr old's public school sex ed class. This is just SOME of what we dealt with:

A sticker for when girls are ""in crisis"". It's for a NO ABORTION UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES clinic that makes it REALLY DIFFICULT to learn they are a no abortion ever clinic.

A brochure about STD'S that explains how INEFFECTIVE CONDOMS ARE AND HOW THEY DON'T REALLY WORK. 

A ""magazine"" that not only equates rape by incest w/regretting a consenting encounter, uses terms like ""pure"", ""clean"" and, I shit you not, ""lust of the beast"", it also gives FALSE medical information, does a bunch of victim shaming, and don't forget the obligatory ""if you masturbate, you won't be able to love your spouse and kids"". 

Gave the girls post-its to put on and off their bodies to show how everytime you have sex, you are less able to love your husband and kids.

Showed a slide show of famous people and told the class to imagine how different the world would be if their moms had abortions.

A straight up BIBLE QUOTE on a separate piece of RED paper

I called the school. I was told MULTIPLE TIMES by the assistant principal and Assistant Superintendent the following:

I am the 1st parent in 15 years to complain about this group.

They don't know who approved them 15 years ago. They don't know whether or not the group is reviewed for approval at all anymore.

It's not ""up to them"" to read everything that is given to the children in their school district from outside groups.

They ""don't have the time to review the medical info given to the kids from outside groups"". In fact, and I QUOTE ""we don't have the time to look at every piece of paper that is given to the students"". 

Not a SINGLE, SOLITARY ADMIN OR PRINCIPAL HAD EVER READ THE INFO

They do have a comprehensive sex ed program. I'll admit that. When I asked why that group specifically was brought in, they said to show the ""many sides"" of the issue. I asked for a list of any and all groups brought to the sex ed class this year. The pro-choice group is it and has been for years.

 I asked if they could bring a medical doctor from a woman's clinic to, at the very least, give the ""other side"" a chance to explain that condoms work and there is no chemical that is released when a man masturbates to make them love their children less (no shit on that either. it said that...ALOT). They said no. (note: they said they often bring groups in other classes to show ""other sides"". I asked what classes/groups/sides, etc. i got no current example but I was told it would be similar to bringing in a WW2 Japanese soldier to talk abt the war. I explained that the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor and committed mass atrocities during the war. I asked if they would bring in a German Soldier for WW2 to explain ""their side"" and he said i was being ridiculous!) 

I asked if I could be present the following day when they returned to the class. I was told no.

I asked if my daughter could record the group in her class. I was told no.

I was told it's not their job to make sure the medical information given to the kids in health class is medically accurate and it's up to the parents to decide ""what to believe"". Cause that's how facts work, i guess.

After WEEKS and threatening legal action, they finally said the group won't return ""to the school"" (they didn't say district), that they reported the guest who gave the religious quotes (but didn't tell me who they were reported to), and that it was done.

This group goes to 14 school districts in my area-MIDDLE AND HIGH SCHOOL. There is SO MUCH MORE to this but, for time, I just brought out a few examples. 

What can I do to protect other kids from this group? Do I have any legal standing to fight them and, if so, WHO DO TAKE ACTION AGAINST? The school for not caring about what the kids see? The group for breaking the law? The school board? The state edu dept? 

What do i do?

LiberalFeministChica,2018-04-20 16:33:01+00:00,[UPDATE] Being Sued for something Insurance decided I was 0% at fault for,"This is an update on an earlier [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7ynrru/being_sued_for_something_insurance_decided_i_was/)  I made back in February.

The hearing was yesterday. I arrived early, and brought my dad for moral support. Turns out it didn't matter: only the plaintiff, my lawyer and myself were allowed in. This is likely to minimize dramatic outbursts.

The plaintiff got to go first. He told the judge that I ""t-boned him"" in the parking lot. He made a lot of statements that did not make sense. He said the parking lot was ""crowded"" and then went back and said there were ""no other cars around"" and I came ""out of nowhere.""

My lawyer interrogated him and the guy admitted he had not seen my car before hitting me, because he did not look over his left shoulder before backing up. That, I believe, cinched the case.

He sued me for $1200 (the cost of the damage to his vehicle) but we found out he only paid $500 out of pocket, since that was his insurance deductible. So worst case scenario, I would've owed him $500, not $1200.

Finally, my lawyer submitted a photocopy of NYS law where it says that a person who has a vehicle in reverse has an obligation to ensure ""reasonably safety"" before beginning to back, which we successfully proved he did not do, because he hit my (fully stopped) car.

The judge said she would write her decision and mail it to us both. I tried to wait patiently, but today on my lunch break I called the court, and they told me the case had been dismissed.

He was awarded NO money whatsoever. I am hopeful that I will never have to see him again. (Out of curiously I did stalk his facebook page and found out EVERY SINGLE PICTURE OF HIM is him smoking a joint...so...that's...something. Irrelevant to the case, but interesting, and gave me a laugh.)

I think the guy really was just totally clueless. 

Anyway, a win is a win is a win! Woohoo! I can sleep again!

Not popping corks until I get the paperwork, but they gave me and the evaluator final approval over all goals. He will also get summer services to prevent regression because I told them I would retain him a grade without it. Cheaper to give him 6 weeks of summer ed than another year of intensive elementary ed.

clockworksnapple,2018-04-19 13:59:19+00:00,[UPDATE] Corrupt Post Office employee allowing my abusive parents to collect my mail; desperately need advice.,"Location: West Virginia, US

Hi everyone, many of you requested an update, so here it is. I locked my last post because I was worried about the amount of visibility I was getting before an investigation could take place. I really wish I could say it is a positive update where justice was properly served, but unfortunately that’s not how small town politics work. More legal advice requested near the bottom. 

As many of you suggested, I reported the events to the Office of Inspector General. Instead of handling it as I thought they would, my complaint was volleyed around between the OIG, the US Postal Inspection Service, and the USPS Consumer and Industry Contact Office for awhile. It seemed like nobody I spoke to wanted to take me seriously because it was my parents stealing my mail and not Stranger Bob. Anyway, I finally got in contact with a very understanding woman at the USPIS who took my report, reaffirmed that what happened to me was a crime, and assured me that this would be investigated. 

Well…it wasn’t. My complaint went right back to the Consumer and Industry Contact Office, where, for whatever earthly reason, it was forwarded directly to my mom’s friend and the PO employee responsible (We’ll call her Nancy) for her to handle. Instead of a crime, these events have been considered a customer service issue and were passed on to Nancy to smooth over herself. Within an hour, I received a very frantic and typo-rich email from Nancy in which she explained that she “didn’t think it was a problem” and offered me a brisk apology. She “now knows I only want my mail delivered to whatever it is addressed” and encouraged me from now on to trust her to send my mail to the proper location. Moreover, I am almost certain she told my mother that I reported her, because my mother has been more unfriendly towards me than usual when I have spoken to my parents (not that being ignored by her is necessarily a bad thing). 

I haven’t been able to get a PO Box in a nearby town yet, but as soon as my final exams are over, that is the plan. In the meantime, all of the other mail I have received from scholarship organizations, tax returns, etc. have arrived as they should at my current address. 

I suppose my question is, what more can I do here? Who else is there to contact? I feel as if my rights and confidentiality have been violated, and that even if I have my passport back, I have no idea what other mail has been stolen from me in the two years since I moved out of my parents’ house. Is this really not a legal issue, and should a poorly-worded apology be all I expected to come from this? 

Again, many thanks for your help and support, Reddit.

Right after I bought the place, before I even started moving in, I got an official warning from the HOA that my next door neighbor has called their emergency line 3 times over my pet bird that is so loud in the mornings it startled him awake and caused him emotional distress. In their email they specifically said what time my bird was making these loud noises. 

Now, the thing is I don’t have any pets, and for the past few nights I’ve stayed up to that specific time to see if I could here anything loud and disturbing as he described(which I did not, aside from a few birds chirping quietly outside). However, this neighbor is still calling the HOA’s emergency line every night to complain about my bird. The HOA manager doesn’t believe I don’t have a pet bird, even though I’ve offered to let him come see. He said that I could just be hiding the bird.

Today I got a letter from Animal Welfare and Enforcement about my bird’s vocalizations disturbing the peace. It said that I can be taken to court because of my bird if the neighbor complains again. I DON’T HAVE A BIRD OR ANY PET.

imnotviolentjustcraz,2018-04-14 01:55:35+00:00,[CA]My landlord found out I'm schizophrenic and is evicting my family and I.,"I was diagnosed with schizophrenia as a teenager, and am now in my mid-thirties. I have my illness (and other common co-morbid mental illnesses) in check with medication, therapy, and psychiatry. I have always been very aggressive in controlling my mental illness to the best of my ability. I'm married, with two children, stable income, and have never been late on rent.

My family has been renting the same house for nearly ten years now, without issue. We started having trouble with the pipes, so I called the landlord, he told me he'd be by in a few hours while my husband and I were at work. 

Our oldest was recently diagnosed with schizophrenia as well, I gave her access to my medical paperwork I keep at home (so she can see how not horrible my treatment has been throughout my life), and when she got home from school yesterday, she grabbed the folder from my bedroom, had been reading it, and left it on the kitchen table. Our landlord snooped through the paperwork, and realized what it was. He called me, angry that I had hidden such a ""huge risk factor"" from him, and told me he was evicting us. Sure enough, this morning, I saw that he'd put a notice on our door, giving us thirty days to vacate the property, and listed the reason for evicting us as lying on our application for the place. 

To make matters worse, one of my neighbors, with whom I am good friends, came and informed me when I got home from work today that the landlord had been warning everyone about the ""schizo"" and informed her he had called CPS because ""people like [me] shouldn't have kids."" He apparently called my husband's cell as well, and let him know that I was ""hiding"" my illness from him, and he needed to get himself and the kids out of the house and away from me. I have never hidden my illness from my husband (in fact it was one of the things I warned him about very early in our relationship), and I'm very stressed over this and it's barely been 24 hours. I wouldn't be surprised to hear he called my work as well.

I suppose on a legal standpoint, my questions are: 1) Does he have the right to evict my family because I'm schizophrenic? 2) Is there anything I can do about him blabbing my medical history to everyone he can? 3) Is there anything I can do to make this just... stop?

My husband and have already decided to move, we'd been saving up for a down payment on a house, and were almost finished - i spoke with my mother this evening and she's giving us the rest of what we needed to save as a christmas/anniversary/birthday gift for us both, so we're probably going to move into a small apartment and house-hunt.

There were a bunch of people and police who talked to all of us more and eventually they took us to a place where they said we'd stay for now. Like a shelter or something.

Seven months ago my wife and I were driving on a state road adjacent to a sidewalk, speed limit was 40 we were going 35 (I get motion sick and this road has a lot of bumps so we were going as slow as we could without being a hazard.) 

My wife was driving, I was in the passenger seat, the sidewalk was on the passenger side. 

There was a boy (4 years old) on a scooter (this kind 🛴 ) several yards in front of his mother. They were having an argument of some sort because we heard them going back and forth as we got closer. 

The boy scootered from her and into the street, going from the middle of the sidewalk to the road in a matter of a single second. 

My wife slammed on the breaks, it was too late. He died at the scene. It was incredibly gruesome. We stayed put until the police officers took us in to take our statements then told us we could go home. 

Now she is being sued for manslaughter and reckless driving and we are both being sued for child endangerment . There were no stop signs, crosswalks, pedestrian crossing signs, or lights within a half a mile of where we were driving, (it’s known to be quite a busy road) and the police even noted in their record we were going under the speed limit. 

They have had our insurance information from day one. I don’t know why they’re suing us (well, of course I do, but I don’t know how they could think its anything other than a horrific accident without anyone at fault.)

I was sitting in my bathtub and it suddenly struck me that I was completely prepared to just stop living because I was too scared to find help.  So I went and found help.  

I took all of last week off and with my ex-husband's help, I found a good, understanding and very very patient therapist.  I've also made an appointment to see a psychiatrist, to see what medication options are open to me.

When I finally went back to work, I took the head of the Fun Committee aside and talked to her.  I explained to her that I have PTSD and some very severe anxiety issues and I apologized for not being more clear to her when I asked her not to do anything for my birthday.

And she cried.  She wept openly and apologized, she told me she thought I was just shy, that she was just trying to help me fit in and she never intended to do anything hurtful to me.  

Then, I spoke to my Manager and my workspace is being moved to a far less-populated part of the building, where I can just quietly do my work and be left alone.  It is literally all I have ever wanted.

So, the moral of this story was, fucking talk to people about your shit before it gets so bad you feel like you have no choice but fucking die.  Apparently.

hey_ross,2018-04-09 02:00:31+00:00,My daughter was baptized at a church service by a sitter without our consent,"Hi all - need recommendations for a legal strategies on a parental rights and freedom of religion issue, as well as possible battery.

We had a sitter ask permission to take our daughters (6/11) and to put them into child care so she could attend service on Sunday. Instead, she had my oldest baptism against our will. We are Catholic and my daughter was baptized with my wife when she converted, so this is a deeply personal issue for us.

They church is at fault for not seeking parental permission and the sitter service for not monitoring their contractor, but given them held an 11 year old under water without consent may constitute battery, so looking for legal advice.

Already reached out to some attorneys today, but being Sunday looking for armchair advice in advance of meeting with them from the Hivemind.

In play here are the sitter, the agency she works for and this mega-church who randomly baptizes kids without parental consent.

What’s my angles for ensuring this never happens to another kid and parent?

Incident was in Snohomish county, Washington.

legalapartment123,2018-04-09 00:31:08+00:00,[California] Woman in my apartment accused me of harassment when I complained about her using my parking spot. Landlord is now trying to evict me.,"For context, I am a single 53 year old male.  The woman is in her 20s and has her boyfriend over almost every weekend.  

Her apartment only comes with one parking spot, so when her boyfriend comes over, he parks in my spot and I have to park on the street.  At first, I left a note on his car politely saying ""this is my assigned spot, please don't park here without permission, all guests must park in the guest parking"". He ignored it.  

I then informed the office.  They said they would look into it but never did anything.  

One day I saw this girl in the hallway and I told her to make sure her boyfriend doesn't use my spot.  She basically told me to get lost.  

Then there was a gap of about a month.  Remember that during this time, every Friday-Sunday I have to park my car on the street because either this girl or her boyfriend takes my spot before I get home.  I am too old to walk that far comfortably, although not actually handicapped.  I notified the office again, they again said they would look into it but never did.

Then last week, I again ran into the girl.  I again told her to please make sure she doesn't use my spot.  She flipped out on me and told me to get lost.  

The next day, I got called into the office.  Apparently she told them that I threatened her, touched her inappropriately, groped her, and yelled at her.  The manager was not interested in hearing my side of the story, and said that my lease would be terminated with 30 days notice.  My lease runs through December 31, but the manager said there is a clause that enables it to be terminated if the resident engages in criminal activity on the premises.  

I am still obviously shaken and not exactly sure what to do here.  I have lived here for 8 years now and never had any problems, and I feel like no one is listening to me about any of this.  I don't really have money to move right now either.  Please give me some advice on how to handle it.

Teacherbruisedmykid,2018-04-08 00:39:32+00:00,Teacher left hand print shaped bruises on my daughter's arms,"Phoenix, Arizona

&amp;nbsp; 

Hello everyone, this is a throwaway account for obvious reasons. I would also like to apologize if this is a bit jumbled. I'm extremely rattled right now and doing my best to keep it together, but it is difficult.

&amp;nbsp; 

On Thursday my daughter Vivian came home from school and, as every other day, I asked her how her day went. She gave me an account of what sounded like a normal day in first grade. She did mention to me however, that one of the other students (who has known behavioral problems) was throwing a fit because she wanted to stand in my daughter's spot in line rather than her own spot. Vivian offered to let the other child cut in line because she was sick of hearing her whine. At this point one of the teachers (who we will call Mr. S) removed my daughter from her spot in the line and put her in the back. Now, at this point my thought process was, okay, so this guy's a jerk. He's going to punish Vivian for giving up her spot in line to an upset child. He's an ass, We've known this. He's a miserable person who clearly hates children, but, moving a child to the back of the line isn't exactly something to take up arms about.

&amp;nbsp; 

Later that evening my spouse and I took Vivian out for ice cream. At one point she placed her elbows on the table to hold her cone closer to her face. That's when I saw the bruises. There are hand shaped marks on my child's arms. I asked her ""what had happened!!? Did someone grab you?"" Vivian says ""yeah, Mama... I told you earlier that Mr. S grabbed me and moved me to the back of the line.""

Obviously, at this point I'm seeing red and doing my best to remain calm for the sake of my child. I examine the bruises, ask Vivian to repeat her story, and gently press the bruises to assess how bad the damage is. I took multiple pictures in different lighting and a different angles. She is 100% certain that it was Mr. S who did this to her and the marks are in the shape of an adult's hand.

&amp;nbsp; 

To give you some background, this is not the first time my daughter has come home bruised or bloody. The school allowed four boys to corner her and drag her across the playground. Her clothes were torn, and her hands, knees, and stomach were bloody. No one called. She wasn't given medical attention. All of the adults refuse to accept responsibility for not watching the children. After I raised a huge stink with the school, those four boys were separated into groups of two and they had to write ""Reflections"" on their behavior. That's all that happened. And nothing has changed- two of the boys continue to harass my daughter despite our constant communication with the staff and my daughter's daily protests.

&amp;nbsp; 

Mr. S used to work at the school as the PE teacher, but that was before my daughter's time at the school. In the last couple of weeks he has reemerged as a member of the front office staff.
Most of the teachers at the school seem to hate their jobs and hate children in general. My daughters primary teacher has no control over her classroom, and when I chaperoned for a field trip I watched her allow a child to scream and roll around in the middle of the floor babbling nonsense - all the while the teacher says ""Lily could you please stand up. Lily could you please stop. Lily *sigh* okay I guess.""  It isn't like this is a school where the teachers are understaffed with huge classes. This is a specialty college prep school. Vivian only has 18 children in her classroom. All of this is to give you an idea of the situation at her school. We had already determined that we were not going to have her stay another year, however, coming home with bruises like this means she's not going back at all. We have obtained admission to another school that she will start at sometime next week.

&amp;nbsp; 

I went to the police and they told me that Arizona is a corporal punishment State and the teachers are allowed to use as much physical Force as they deem necessary to punish and discipline children. I was aghast and told the officer that he couldn't possibly be telling me that leaving handprint shaped bruises on my daughter's arms was reasonable force. I said  ""if I had given Vivian those bruises and the school called the police, we would be having a very different conversation right now, and my child would be taken by CPS! Why is it okay that the teacher do it?"" He honestly did not seem to care and just kept pointing with a pen at a printed statute and telling me that it was legal to hit children in the state of Arizona. I watched my daughter lose all faith whatsoever in any kind of a justice system when the police didn't even want to speak to her, the victim of abuse. She cried as they walked away and asked ""Mama, why don't the police want to help me?""

&amp;nbsp; 

Vivian's school was closed on Friday for professional development so we contacted the superintendent's office. They did not call me back, however they pushed the information along to the principal who did call me. Then he asks me ""are you sure it was Mr S? Are you sure it wasn't someone else at the school?""

&amp;nbsp; 

......  So wait, you're telling me that you suspect multiple members of your faculty of hitting children?!?  He wants us to come in on Monday and have Vivian physically point out the person who hurt her. This concerns me because Mr. S  is a shouting, aggressive, posturing, asshat. I watched him yell at a parent once because their child was late during State Testing. The parent said ""What am I supposed to do, my car broke down!"" and Mr. S said ""I don't care!! you're late!! you're late!!! you're LATE!!!"" barking at the top of his lungs. Should I even bring my daughter into that kind of situation? I'm going to report this to the Department of Education, but who knows what could that will do in a state where the law protects child abusers...

&amp;nbsp; 

So, here is the big question. What can I do?  Was the cop I talked to correct? Was he just being lazy? Should I sue them? What for? How? I'm so lost. I just want to protect my baby.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8amh9w/teacher_left_hand_print_shaped_bruises_on_my/,legaladvice,2110,209,0.0
angrymejv,2018-04-07 13:48:57+00:00,(FLORIDA) We have a pool and a fence and the next door (in the back) neighbor's kid keeps coming over the fence after being told not to. I'm not sure what are my best courses of action.,"(Florida, Miami-Dade county, unincorporated)

I am living with my mom who has dementia. She's getting to be more than I can handle. We have a caregiver and I'm trying to move out of state to again be with my SO, so I think I need to act soon for several reasons.


This kid has been repeatedly told to not come into the yard. He comes to get his ball. They play a lot and it comes into our yard a lot, sometimes many times a day. I think he's in the first years of elementary school. The pool has only a foot or 2 of water in it but it has algae, etc. and of course is still unsafe. 


I talked to who I think was his significantly older brother and he told him not to do it also. I thought things were resolved but apparently not. I caught him back there with another kid the other day. He didn't even try to run or hide or otherwise leave the yard. I told him again to not come in the yard. He also said he sometimes comes to the front door (as we asked) and my mom doesn't hear him, I'm assuming that was another excuse for him to enter on his own. Nothing seems to work with this kid. 


I don't know what to do next. If I talk to the parents then they know I know he comes over. Additionally, I rarely see this kid supervised. A few years ago I even saw him with an axe and nobody watching him. (Also, it's a duplex and I keep finding garbage thrown into our yard from one or both of them.) They act friendly to us but that could obviously easily change in any number of scenarios. 


From what I've read here and elsewhere, we would be the ones at fault. I don't need more trouble than I already have and I don't want us to get sued. 

Please excuse me for not having more specific questions. Thank you in advance.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8ai543/florida_we_have_a_pool_and_a_fence_and_the_next/,legaladvice,1888,231,1.0
soon2beovr,2018-04-07 03:16:33+00:00,UPDATE: [NJ] Changing locks on (soon to be) ex in apt I own,"Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8a9kyp/nj_changing_locks_on_soon_to_be_ex_in_apt_i_own/

Well on the advice of this sub I decided too move my sensitive stuff into a small storage locker in my neighborhood.  Today when she came home there was an envelope that placed on the door with the following letter:

“Dear *****,
I wish to desolve our relationship and, in the process serve you with a notice of eviction. You have until 5/6/18 to vacate the apartment.  I will inform you that as of today I have documented the condition of the apartment and my belongings inside.  You will be held responsible for any damage or deviation in the condition of my belongings during the next 30 days. “

The sub suggested I serve her personally but instead I taped the envelope to the door and sent a certified letter to her work.  I didn’t want to risk confrontation and after what would happen it appears I was right. 

Camping out at my friends house around 6:45pm EST I received a flurry of calls from her, the last time leaving me a hysterical voicemail.  Based on the context I assume she received my letter of eviction.

About 8:30pm I received a phone call from my apt complex manager.  He asked me if I was home, when I confirmed I wasn’t he told me he received a call from a neighbor.  Apparently my (now) ex threw a temper tantrum outside my apartment (either before, after or during her calls to me) and when my neighbor asked her to quiet down she “threatened” my neighbor and her dog.  Since the manager was not present he recommended my neighbor call police, which she did. He does not know what’s going on as of now but is on his way home so will know soon enough.  Not sure what this means for me but he wanted to give me the heads up.  Considering all going on I’m glad he did.  I asked him to check my parking spot when he gets in, if her car is not there I may check in the apartment to see if she went off on my stuff in the morning.

I work in a very small office with 6 other people.  Yesterday, one of our fellow employees was leaving for a new job, so we threw a going away party, which was pretty rowdy.

We all slept at the office last night as we were too drunk to drive home.  We all slept over, and no one else was in our office except for one of the employee's wive's who brought him a shirt around 8:30 and the pizza guy who both left without entering my space.

superdupercooper112,2018-04-06 19:49:37+00:00,Grandparents Trying to Fight for Sole Custody.,"I apologize in advance for how long this will be but bear with me. 

I was 12 when “J” and I started dating. “J” was only a year older than me and had lived in the neighbourhood that I lived in since we were 6/7. Our relationship continued for four years. 3 years in, being young and dumb, I have him my virginity because I was “in love” and we “would be together forever.” 

I got pregnant. Only a few weeks away from my sixteenth birthday I found out. However, at this point, “J” has been seeing other girls and we were broken up. When I called him to tell him that I was pregnant, and showed him a picture of the test, he told me to stop lying cause no matter what he didn’t wanna be with me anymore. 

A month later I got the courage to tell my mom about the pregnancy after deciding I would keep the baby. When I went for the first ultrasound there was 3 little sacs on the screen. I had conceived spontaneous triplets, but the doctor who came in said one was quite a bit smaller than the other two and it was looking like at the next appt I would be carrying twins only, which is what happened. 

Throughout this time I never heard from “J” or his parents, however my mom had called about 50x a week. We gave them updates through these voicemails and throughout the pregnancy about what was going on, the vanishing triplet, etc. They never called back, however we still kept in contact with them right up to the end of the pregnancy. We had even left messages asking if they would adopt one/both twins (I was considering adoption after the shock of two) and had ZERO response. 

On April 2sd id gone in for some light bleeding. They discovered the cord was wrapped around one twins neck, and decided to keep me for observation since the c-section was planned for the next day. Baby had heart fluctuations because of the cord so I was brought in for a section, and babies were born that night. My mom had contacted “J”’s parents and told them that the babies were expected to arrive that night. 

They showed up without calling or anything, so my mom wouldn’t let them past the door. She told them they couldn’t just waltz in after nine months of ignoring us and expect to be able to hold the babies. She told them they could try calling first, or answering any one of our calls. 

We brought the twins home yesterday. “Js” parents are now trying to get sole custody saying that I’m an unfit mother. They’ve said nothing about “J” who was sent away to some relative months ago. They left a pretty nasty voice mail saying a lot of stuff, including how they intend to use every bit of “evidence” in court to fight for custody.

Basically, their main argument is; 

1. I’m a drug using teenager (I’ve never touched anything. I had a sip of wine at Christmas when I was 13 and that’s it) 

2. My house is over crowded (8 people currently, 7 in August when my older brother moves out. It’s a 4B 4.5Bath home) 

3. Our home is filthy (may not be the cleanest all the time with my siblings running around, but it’s fit for living in for sure. No poo or anything, no rotten food laying around, just scattered toys and quite a bit of evidence of 6 people living there before two babies) 

4. I was doing drugs which made the third baby from early in the pregnancy not develop

5. Twins were born early due to my “drug abuse” 

6. My babies are tiny “crack babies”. Yes, she actually referred to them as crack babies, because they weren’t 8lbs like her sons were. This is the comment that angers me the most; I went 39 weeks pretty much with those two, and I did a damn good job getting them to pack on the weight. One was 6lb4oz, the other 6lb7oz WHICH IS KIND OF BIG FOR TWINS. 

7. Because I considered adoption I clearly do not want them (it’s true, I considered adoption. Not because I didn’t want them. Because I didn’t want them to grow up in poverty if I couldn’t get shit straightened out by the time they came) 

8. At 16, I’m unfit to be a mother. (This is the point I’m most worried about... my area seems to be very anti teen mom, and I worry if a judge would share those views. I’m going to do my absolute best, but it’s not an ideal situation, y’know?) 


Anyway, my question is should I be worried about her getting sole custody? Most of it is lies or just false information, but I’m worried she will continue to make things up and have CAS/CPS come investigate, which would be traumatic for my younger siblings (ages 11, 8, and 4).

Long story short my neighbor had reported me. This is not something that the county would see from the street or even care about. I learned from my other neighbors that this particular neighbor like to police the neighborhood.

That situation was annoying but no big deal because I had planned on cutting up the wood anyways when weather permitted it.

Come summer I was reported for grass being too tall and for bushes that I planted. It seemed that every other week I got some sort of notice for something. 

I am not a dirty person and I keep my house nice. Since I've moved in I've added a garden, painted the back deck, cleaned up and sealed the cracks in the driveway, plastered my front porch. In short, i take care of my property. I am also military and have lived in military housing with very strict guidelines. I have never had an issue.

I tried addressing said neighbor with a letter. And it came down to talk to me if you have an issue, and if you're not going to talk to me and just report me then I'd rather us not talk at all because I don't do fake pleasantries. 

I sent that letter over a year ago.  

We still haven't talked. Neither him or his wife have talked to me to address any of this. 

In the meantime he does these fake nice things of grabbing my garbage containers and throwing away the newspaper that is thrown on my driveway. I let it go because whatever. He can knock himself out if that makes him happy. 

Well it turns out that he had gone in my backyard which is surrounded by a chain link fence. He rearrange my trash bins by stacking them and tossed away a cardboard box that had been in my backyard.

Now here's the thing. I kept the trash bins not organized because my roommate has a Chihuahua and the bin blocks this dog from getting between the post of the chain link door and the house. ( my roommate did not mess with the bins or box)

Odd. I placed a padlock on that door and figured that would be a hint and would keep him from going in my yard. Also, i didnt want our dogs getting loose if he left the gate open.

I have no reason to suspect that he's been in my backyard for any other reason but that but I have no idea.

Come this past winter he started to snow blow the new sidewalk that was installed through the neighborhood in front of my house. No biggie he can knock himself out. Then he started snow blowing up to my front porch. I did not like this because he can easily look in my window. And for a neighbor who likes to report me for everything it's not something I feel comfortable with.

I spoke to my roommate about this and she didn't like it either. She suggested that I go talk to him and I did that day. In short I covered him not doing chores on my property and that I'm able to do them myself. And besides that I'm an adult and I like my privacy. I am a 31 year old female and have been told i look younger so i really emphasized that I am a fully independent, capable adult. He seemed flustered and said that he does this for everyone and has always done this. I told him that he doesn't have to anymore. He didn't seem happy but appeared to have an understanding.

For a few months, he left my bins and newspaper alone but now he is back at it. Today he took out my full garbage bin from near the fence and put it away after the trash was picked up 

From the outside this is ""nice"" but he only does this for my house. He doesn't do it for the couple acrossed the street who had a baby last year, he doesn't do it for the neighbor on the other side of him. 

I am under the impression that he feels he has a right to keep my property to his standard and in doing so can take any liberties (going in my yard). Obviously i can't keep up with a retired couples immaculate lawn, but my property is well kept.

How do I address this?

Sisterstalkedmemiss,2018-04-05 09:25:51+00:00,My sister falsely reported myself and my daughter missing and it created a media stir up and a lot of visits from detectives and CBS workers in the domestic violence shelter I was staying in to keep safe from her. (MO),"After leaving my abusive ex boyfriend with my infant daughter, I went to stay with my mother and sister to recover from the horrific emotional and physical trauma we survived for nearly five years. I thought it would be healthy and helpful for us to be around some family who cared and wanted to see us heal from his abuse. 

Keep in mind I had not resided with my mom or sister for over a decade. I'd only made breif visits to my hometown every once and a while. This was fully moved in and no going back. 

I started becoming uncomfortable with some of the behaviors and especially with the way my sister was hitting her daughter with a belt to discipline her. I could not let my daughter see that for fear it could harm her in some way. My mom and sister are very enmeshed both have never lived alone once and are very codependent with one another. There was a lot of drama and zero respect for boundaries, my belongings were being stolen by the kids and were even told by their parents to take money from my purse at one point. I decided it was time to leave as soon as possible. 

After i left I started noticing that my phone was acting strangly. My data kept going over and the battery was always almost too hot to touch. I ended up taking it into an apple store and one of the techs said there had been Spyware installed and a keylogger. He also said that it can't be done remotely so to think of who knows my password. My sister and her kids are the only people. 

The next day I was followed for three hours and at one point I had to flag down the police so that I could tell them what was going on and they helped me get into a domestic violence shelter. At this time I was still talking with my sister as she was pretending to be a sympathetic ear to get info. I told her the name of the town the shelter was in and it wasn't soon after that I told her about the Spyware that had been found on my phone. Her reaction was strange (calling me paranoid and delusional) so strange that I got rid of my phone as fast as possible and had a police escort to the shelter that evening. 

Not soon after that I found out she had filed a missing persons report and tried to have an amber alert issued for my daughter. She had over 12 jurisdictions working to find me because of the lies she had told them. It was everywhere and I couldn't go to the store without someone calling 911. It got to social media and eventually one of the residents inside the shelter started communicating with my sister. I'm not sure what was said but the director was able to see the computer activity. 

The next day CPS came to the shelter door. I don't know how they knew for sure that I was ther, but I'll make an educated guess it was because of the correspondence between the shelter resident and my sister. My sister is an LPN and she tried to use her mandated reporter status to make it more convincing. She was also accessing our medical records to get our location. 

I met with the detective from CPS that same day and it was flagged as unfounded and closed. She said that they see this situation all of the time and that it's usually the person calling who should be investigated. 

Now any time anyone Googles my name or my daughters this whole thing comes up and it paints me as this unhinged, mentally unstable and unfit mother all because of what my sister fabricated. I'll never find a job in my state and I'm considering moving away. 

This has to be illegal or at least something could be done through a civil lawsuit? 

What can I do?
.
Edit: CPS not CBS I'm title.

Also, I still don't understand why she is doing this to my daughter and I. I can't think of any reason other than pure enjoyment and possibly some type of personality disorder.

I also forgot to add that she had taken pictures of my car and license tag weeks before this all unfolded. A detective was able to see when and where each photo was taken.

isthistoxic,2018-04-05 03:36:38+00:00,Tricked into eating something I don’t eat at work. Is this illegal/a toxic work environment?,"This is in Alabama. I’m really really upset over all of this so I’m sorry if it doesn’t make sense. This happened last week and it was only brought to my attention today what exactly I ate and I’m a mess. My coworkers all cook a lot and bring in food for everyone. They all know I have food restrictions because I usually don’t partake (which pisses most of them off because it’s “rude”). One girl brought in a pie and was very proud of herself, saying I could eat it. So I did because I’m a trusting idiot. My stomach was a wreck that night and the next day but I’m pregnant and have a weird stomach anyways so I didn’t connect the dots. There’s been some other shit since and I’m on even stricter rules right now. One of my coworkers was commenting on it all today after seeing me eat my sad work dinner, and said outright that it isn’t the end of the world if I eat the stuff I’m not supposed to because “a lightning bolt won’t come from heaven and kill you”. I sort of gave her a look and she laughed and said it didn’t when I ate the pie and told me what was in it. I’m so so upset right now. I genuinely don’t know what to do or say. They’ve ignored my wishes and been outright hostile before but never like this. I went home crying last week over something else and filed with HR over it but they didn’t take it seriously and this is just my breaking point. I’m not coming back after I have this baby but is there something I can do legally? TL;DR- Coworkers put something I don’t eat into food and lied about it to me, saying they specifically made it safe for me. Now they told me they did it to prove a point. Do I have legal recourse?

waycebrune,2018-04-04 19:00:52+00:00,A family friend found out that my husband abducted me and is threatening to call the police [NY],"I come from a Central Asian nation where bride-kidnapping is very common. However, it is often performed consensually for the sake of tradition, as occurred in my case. I was dating the man who would become my husband for three years, and I view the abduction as essentially a quirky proposal. We had talked about marriage before. He knew I wanted to marry him. He and his friends grabbed me from the street in the city where I was going to college and brought me back home to the town we both came from for the wedding he had arranged with my family and his. We have been married 9 years and I love him like crazy.

We now live in the USA for several years. We have lots of American friends, from work, from the gym, from school (I am currently pursuing my Masters Degree) and from the neighbourhood. One of them is a woman, W, who is 25 and got engaged recently to her long-term girlfriend, G. We were really happy for her. They came over for dinner two nights ago, and were chatting about wedding plans and how the engagement happened, etc. Then G asked us about our engagement and my husband told her our story. I noticed W's face looked very unhappy, so I was quick to say how happy I was at how things happened, how much I love my husband, and how my sister had recently had a much more ""Western"" style engagement and broken my parents' hearts!

However, after dinner while my husband was clearing up and making the tea, W took me aside and told me that she and G were willing to take me in while I divorced my husband and pressed charges against him for abduction and ra.pe. I tried to laugh these off and told her it was just a quirky tradition, our version of a public engagement, and that I was very happy. She got angry and told me I had Stockholm Syndrome. I said I didn't like her telling me my own thoughts and she began to shout at my husband, calling him names and accusing him of abuse and battery. She and G then left.

My husband and I didn't really know what to do or think. When I saw W yesterday I told her I was really unhappy at how she had acted. In response, she told me she was planning to call the police on my husband for unlawful imprisonment, forced marriage and sexual crimes because I had been deluded into accepting my situation. What's worse is that she has presented this version of our marriage to many of our circle of friends, and I don't know how to explain the real story without seeming like I'm making excuses.

My legal questions:
- can she call the local police on something that was 
a) done in my home country
b) done with my consent

- how much trouble will my husband be in?

- if so, what preparations should my husband and I make to defend ourselves, to prove that we are a happy couple and our relationship is consensual? Is my word that I am happy enough? 

- does W's spreading of this false information about our family constitute defamation? I don't want to get involved in a lawsuit but I was hoping to pressure W into telling our friends that she had lied, otherwise I don't know what I'm going to do to repair ties.

Lastly, and perhaps a little off topic, but my husband and I don't have any children together but we are looking after one of my husband's relatives for the long term, as her mother has returned home to look after a very sick relative who is expected to die soon. We don't have any official guardianship status over her as far as I know, could this get us in some kind of legal trouble? We have never ever had any reason to have contact with the police in this country so I am not certain how thorough this investigation will be, if there is an investigation.

tl;dr: my now-husband abducted me for our wedding according to our home nation's traditions; my friend found out and is threatening police action, how do I deal with this?",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/89sf6y/a_family_friend_found_out_that_my_husband/,legaladvice,1245,122,0.0

Hey guys,

So the tenants did come pick up the dogs the same night I spoke to the management company. The next day, however, I got a call from the neighbor telling me that they brought the dogs back and put them back in the house. She called the police immediately, and the police came and got in contact with the ASPCA to do a walk-through and get a look at the dogs. The dogs were absolutely filthy and in terrible shape. Today the dogs are being taken to a shelter and the police are gathering statements from neighbors with the intention of pressing charges. Hopefully the dogs can be re-homed and the owners will face some hefty fines or maybe jail time. One can hope.

OverallFisherman,2018-04-04 12:36:15+00:00,[ON] The large retailer I work for is saving customers' email addresses with their credit/debit card information. They just sent a company-wide memo telling employees to lie to customers about this.,"Edit: I am in Ontario, Canada. 

So I just want to preface this by saying I am not interested in taking any legal action here, I am more just curious about how legal/illegal any of this is, because to me it is at least ethically fishy.

I work for a well known North American retailer (like, there is one in almost every single mall). With every transaction put through the POS cashiers are required to ask customers for their email address. These emails are then linked to the debit or credit card they paid with. So, in the future when they pay with the same card, their email address with pop up automatically without the cashier typing it in. But if the same customer paid with a different card or cash, then their email would need to be taken again. Not sure if this is relevant, but their email is not enrolling them in any membership program, it is just opting them into the promotional emails/coupons the company sends out. The thing is, if a customer has unsubscribed from our emails, but then they pay with the card linked to their email address and the cashier hits ""submit"" they will start receiving the emails again (often without their consent/knowledge, because the cashier will just hit submit without saying anything).

I guess there was a recent customer complaint that lead to a company-wide memo being sent out. A cashier let a customer know that their email had popped up automatically and when the customer asked how, the cashier explained it was linked to their card. The customer was upset that the company was storing their card information and tying it to their email address. This week we received the memo and part of it says,

""If a customer questions how the cashier found the customer's email in the POS, respond with: ""our system recognizes your email once we start typing it in because you've shared your email with us before."" We do not locate customer email addresses with their credit/debit card number.""

This is a complete lie. Their email pops up before the cashier types anything in, and even if the cashier does start typing an email address the system does not locate any previously captured emails, no email address suggestions pop up or anything like that. And yes, the email address is located through the credit/debit card. The company is instructing the cashiers to flat-out lie.

So, r/legaladvice, what's the deal here?",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/89p26q/on_the_large_retailer_i_work_for_is_saving/,legaladvice,2160,112,0.0
molestoroom,2018-04-03 22:16:50+00:00,UPDATE [VA] Questions about a sex offender/paroled felon wanting to falsely claim my home as his residence,"So I made [this post] (https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/832reb/va_questions_about_a_sex_offenderparoled_felon/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link) asking for help re:  my landlord being offered money to lie about a sex offender residing in our house, because said sex offender wanted to live with his girlfriend and his girlfriend's young children but the terms of his parole do not allow him to live with unrelated minors (or something like that). It didn't get a ton of attention or anything but the responses did help me try to resolve the situation, so I thought I would give an update for the people who pointed me in the right direction and were concerned about the kids involved.

I talked to my dumbass landlord/roommate and let him know that what he was considering is fraud and that he could potentially go to jail for something like that, and that he'd have a much harder time paying down his medical debt from in the clink. I told him that I was telling the authorities no matter what, but that I did not want to get him in trouble or cause problems for him, and he agreed to cooperate with me.

On the advice of someone here, I got in touch with the department of corrections and they were able to direct me to the Probation &amp; Parole office in my city. I talked to someone there, who had someone else call me back later and get all the information I could give. Pringle's alias was known to the parole department and they said they would look into it and get back to me if they needed more details from me or Jeff.

The important thing that happened was that somebody else (from what I heard from mutual friends a relative of the girlfriend) also contacted the authorities within a few days of me. Pringle was offering Jeff so much money because he was in a really tight spot, as Pringle had already moved in with the girlfriend and had been living there for a couple of weeks and was on bad terms with the people at his previous address, so they weren't going to lie for him and say he still lived there. The girlfriend's relative, worried about a sex offender in the house with the girlfriend's young kids, let the police know that he was living with kids in violation of his parole.

Some cops did come by and talk to me and Jeff, and Jeff showed them the messages from Pringle trying to set up the deception, but they really didn't need much from us. They warned us we could possibly be subpoenaed later. We haven't heard from anyone yet but it's only been a couple of weeks. From what I have heard from others, Pringle is back in county jail for his parole violation and Pringle's girlfriend's baby daddy wants to use this to force some changes in their custody agreement which is almost certainly for the best. They have a really volatile relationship but he seems to care about his kids a lot and obviously their mom has pretty bad judgment.

To the best of my knowledge the little kids are okay. Even though someone else turned the guy in for this, I'm still glad that I was able to do the right thing.

clockworksnapple,2018-04-02 21:43:03+00:00,Corrupt Post Office employee allowing my abusive parents to collect my mail; desperately need advice.,"Location: West Virginia, US


Background: I moved out of an abusive household when I turned 18. For a long time after, my parents withheld legal documents from me (such as my social security card and birth certificate) in order to prevent me from being self-supporting and severing my reliance on them. Naturally, they had a history of opening any mail I received in our household, demanded my bank statements, and were just generally invasive. After graduating high school I was able to move in with my boyfriend’s family nearby (same zip code) and officially changed my address.


The issue: I recently discovered that my mother has been able to visit the post office and collect mail that has been addressed to me designated to my new address. She let it slip that her good friend who works at the post office will call her any time I receive mail that is to be delivered to my boyfriend’s address and ask if my mother would prefer to come pick it up. This explains why I have only received 2 bank statements since last summer. Most recently, this post office employee called my mother and let her know that my passport came in and allowed her to come pick up this legal document. Is this a federal offense, such as mail fraud? Can I pursue legal action against this employee in this circumstance? If not, who should I contact to ensure this never, ever happens again?

camarthe,2018-03-31 01:23:42+00:00,good news update! [CA] Grandmother gave my brother and me an equal share portfolio each in the late 90's when we were kids. Brother sold his when they were worth a car. I left mine in and now they're a substantial amount. Brother and his girlfriend want my half now.,"Mostly good news.

I worked with my dad and got my own lawyer.

I got the timeline of my shares wrong, but it comes out the same. What my brother and I inherited from my grandmother was originally part of my grandfather's portfolio, he was the money savvy one. My grandmother looked after those after he died and she personally set up my brother's accounts and gave him control of his part. She didn't do the same with mine before she died (I thought she had already set the accounts up for me and given control to dad before passing) instead the shares were in her will, and she left everything she owned to my dad with instruction that what was $15000 worth when my brother got his equivalent part would go to me when I was old enough to know how to take care of them. There was no trust, she just trusted my dad. My dad did the right thing and set up accounts for me and gave me control six years ago. My dad put some of his own shares in too as an extra leg up.

Dad admitted to me he'd chewed out my brother last year when he came to him asking for money, and dad had supported him several times over the years and got to the point he'd had enough. My brother found out I still had my investments because dad had used me as an example of how brother should have been using money. That's how my brother found out I still had shares and they'd grown.

According to all that info my lawyer tells me I'm in the clear, but it's not going to get to the point of finding that out in court as my brother's gf was only a legal secretary. I say was because the firm she worked for apologised and informed my lawyer she was terminated immediately. The letter I received from them had been edited to put her name in a position higher up than it should have been, and some of the contact information had been changed.

A week after she was fired my brother visited me begging for money. His girlfriend is in serious debt and she took a chance on scamming cash from me and lost. I felt awful rejecting my own brother over and over, and if he hadn't involved his girlfriend needing an amount well into five figures I might have given him some. The next morning I found all my tires had been slashed. Screw him, I don't feel bad any more.

The rest of the comments in the previous thread made me realise I don't know nearly enough about what I'm doing with the shares and dividends and money in general. A lot of the decisions I've made have been with dad's help and his advice has paid off well so far but not because I knew it would but because I had no idea what I was doing and left it up to him. I've booked in to work with a financial advisor to make the most of what I have.

Well I never took mine in the 4 years I worked there, did not get vacation during first year, and collected 3 weeks of it. My boss told me I HAD to take all of it this year as he would not approve any vacation after the end of march. Basically we would get super busy april-may ish and hit a small lul first week of June and then busy throughout the year. Jan - end of march is dead time for us. 

Basically he said if I did not take it, I would lose it and told me it needed to be before april. I scheduled for the last 3 weeks of march coming back on Friday. 

I was terminated 2 days into the vacation by him after it was approved, but my access for email was never turned off. No notification came through, nothing. 

I came in today, my badge still worked, and started working. An hour into my shift my boss pulled me into his office and basically asked me ""What am I doing here.""

Proceeds to tell me I was terminated 2 days into my vacation for abusing the vacation system and that because I was terminated 2 days into it, I would only get paid 2 days of it. We went to HR, I informed them everything that happened and basically plead my case. They said it was already done and that I still had access because I was the only one who turned off access... 

My backup was not doing his job, and apparently did not know how to even use AD to turn off access. 

They tried to make me surrender my phone, and asked me if I would terminate my own access. I told them to pound sand and deleted the company email off of my phone.

My lawyer said if this is the case she might use that as a defense for not stepping in when the kids were being beaten mercilessly by a grown adult man. If this surfaces does it help or hurt my efforts to keep the kids in my custody? 

See below for a link to my original post and an update on where we are right now.

My lawyer agreed he didn’t have the background to handle this case and connected me to a different lawyer with experience in these cases and family court, who is also being very generous with her rates.

In the meantime my ex wife arrived out of nowhere to try and take the kids back. I hadn’t gone into the driveway yet and the kids were tuned into their iPads with headphones on so we went on a spontaneous ice cream run. 

CPS is heavily involved and *six* separate reports were made (originally I had written five but I forgot my first lawyer also filed a report at the instruction of my new lawyer). So, his, mine, my new lawyer’s, the ER doctor, the police who were called to the ER, and their school counselor (at the advice of my new, far more aggressive, lawyer.) The reports are almost definitely what backed the judge into the corner of having to grant the hearing. 

I’m too nervous to sleep. The boys slept some. They seem a bit calmer. 

Hoping for good news and **thank you for all the good advice**. I now see I really needed that new lawyer and filing the multiple reports and getting an exam was the best course of action.

**UPDATE**: Thank you all for your excellent advice. My lawyer is aware that I’m posting on here and said it’s alright - especially since she recognizes she can’t make herself as available as she would if I were a regular client through her firm paying full freight. She’s been wonderful. 

The hearing was pushed back by a couple hours but we can’t leave in case they can see us sooner so we’re waiting now. I’m exceptionally freaked out but my lawyer seems deeply confident it will be open and shut. (The case worker isn’t visiting the house until this afternoon but apparently she’s already visited my ex’s house and talked to the boyfriend and her conclusion from that was to recommend they stay with me.)

The boys have had some interviews and exams with CPS that sound like they went as well as they could have and the things that didn’t go well will help me get them home and safe. 

After this process my next step is an order of no contact on the boyfriend or a restraining order if I can swing it. Will have to ask the lawyer. But she agrees we do need something official in place to keep him at bay.

milkshakeatwork,2018-03-28 20:52:01+00:00,Coworker accidentally consumed my breast milk,"Location: LA, USA

I recently returned to work from maternity leave. As I have an infant at home, I pump breast milk at work. Usually this isn’t a problem because I have an office and a fridge in my office to store the milk and pump parts. Last week I had to travel to a different location for some meetings. I pumped in a visitor office and stored my milk in the kitchen fridge. 

I have a coworker, let’s call him Chad. Chad is a young fellow who has apparently not been around any lactating women. Chad apparently also believes that stuff in the fridge is communal property. 

Now, if you have any familiarity with breastfeeding, you know that breast milk really doesn’t look/taste much like regular milk. Chad did not have that familiarity. Chad ran out of creamer for his coffee and poked around the fridge looking for some to use. Chad found my little cooler, found the bottles, and flavored his coffee with my morning expressed milk. 

In fairness to him, the only label on my breast milk cooler was my name, it didn’t specifically say “Breast milk”. The cooler is a nondescript black cube that came with my pump. It even has a little custom shaped cold pack to keep the bottles cold. The bottles are labeled with the pump brand (which is highly recognizable to anyone who has had any exposure to lactation) but not labeled with the contents. 

Around lunch time, I went back to kitchen to grab my stuff for my mid day pumping session. Chad saw me grab my cooler and told me that he had some that morning and it tasted funny. Well, other people were also in the kitchen, put two and two together, and realized that Chad drank my milk. I was annoyed (I worked hard for that milk!) but I shrugged it off. 

Chad, however, has not. Chad has been the butt of the office jokes for the past week and is now quite butt hurt. Apparently he’s been making snide comments about hazardous body fluids in the food fridge. He’s been making a fuss and talking about suing/reporting me because I tricked him into consuming my milk. 

Now, I know that it’s most likely it’s all bluster and to not worry about unless he actually sues, but, out of curiosity: 
-Is breast milk considered a “hazardous body fluid”? Are there any legal requirements that it needs to be stored separately from adult human food?
-Since he’s being kind of a dick, I’ve been considering asking for compensation. Breast milk costs $4-5 per ounce. Do I have any grounds for demanding 5 bucks?

TrussedDown,2018-03-28 06:14:00+00:00,My ex-wife’s boyfriend is abusing my kids and my custody hearing isn’t until after I’m supposed to bring them back,"Michigan, USA. I just had the most horrific day of my life on Friday. I found out my ex-wife’s boyfriend has been beating our children (7 and 10). 

I split up from my wife about six months ago and she started seeing someone seriously about a month after that. Three or four weeks ago he unofficially moved in. I never liked him, but I never had reason to believe he was violent. 

My custody arrangement is such that I get the kids for a week then she gets the kids for a week, back and forth. 

I didn’t try to sue for full custody at any time because this is totally unprecedented and I’ve never known her to be an unfit parent. Raising the children had nothing to do with why we split up, and nothing related to anger, violence, or general carelessness. 

Friday night she dropped the kids off and, as usual, she barely made eye contact or spoke to me. (I tried to organize an amicable split for the kids’ sake, and it went well at first, then after the papers were signed and assets divided she wasn’t having it.) 

So usually the routine when she drops the kids off on Fridays (around 7:00 or whenever they finish dinner) is we watch the game or play some video games, get a jump start on weekend homework, and then head to bed. 

My younger son was really despondent when she dropped him off and my older was hyper and fidgety. Unlike both of them. Usually they’re perfectly well tempered. If anything my younger son is normally the fidgety one, he has. ADHD, and I’ve never seen him as still and affectless as that day. 

I asked if everything was ok and they said yes. 

So the boys head up to shower then go to their room to change and I come in to say goodnight and see my younger son’s back and chest are covered in bruises. 

I was half paying attention at first and only caught a glimpse, checking my email and catching it out of the corner of my eye. 

I asked him to take his shirt off and he panicked. Not like them at all. I was still helping this one in the bath until earlier in the year and they both would walk around in their boxers all day if we let them. So that raised a flag right away.

To make a long story short he was covered in bruises on top. I had to step out of the room for a second because I didn’t want to break down in front of him. And his legs had prominent lacerations and welts. 

I asked him what happened and he kept telling me he fell. He was definitely coached because he hasn’t lied to me that blatantly since he was like four. 

I didn’t want to press him. My older son finally told me in private what happened. Younger son did poorly on some test and ex’s boyfriend whipped him with a belt. When he cried, the boyfriend just started wailing on him, because “men don’t cry.” I am shuddering even typing that last part, it is the exact opposite of everything I (and my ex!!) had been teaching them their whole lives. 

And the most traumatic part to both of them  was not even the violence of the boyfriend but that my ex was sitting in the room and did nothing. 

Without going to into detail, because I would just get too upset, this was not an isolated incident. Just the first time he left noticeable marks. He’d been hitting both of them, the younger one much more frequently and aggressively than the older one, and told them if they said anything they’d never see their mother again because she would lose custody. And my ex backed him on this. 

I haven’t let on to my ex at all because I don’t want her to know before I can get to court and sue for full custody. I took photos of every injury.

I am so livid. I don’t know if I’m more mad at him for attacking my children, my ex for not doing anything, or myself for not putting the pieces together sooner and doing a deeper dive into the man living with my kids. 

I contacted a lawyer that next morning but he said since the guy technically doesn’t live with them we might not be able to take custody from my ex (he kept his apartment, but according to the kids, he brought a bunch of boxes with clothes over three or four weeks ago and has stayed over every night since).

He also said once my wife catches wind of my suit that she might just take out a restraining order on the guy and swear they’re broken up while still seeing him on the side once she keeps custody.  

Knowing that it isn’t certain I’ll win full custody, it’s  taking all I have to not load them into a car, change our names, and never come back. 

Is there anything else I can do in the meantime? My lawyer says at the end of the week I’ll have no choice but to send them back to her house. Our court date isn’t until Wednesday of next week. 

They’ve barely slept the last two days. The younger one is afraid to sleep alone and keeps getting into bed with his brother, who is so guilt ridden he didn’t do anything to stop it or speak up sooner than he just gets into bed with me and cries all night. (They’re both in counseling starting two days from now.) 

I did not see this coming at all. My ex wife was so against violence she wouldn’t even kill a spider in the kitchen and spend hours trapping it in a glass to release. She found out a teacher had yelled at one of our kids and had a meeting with the principal the same day. It has occurred to me this man is abusing her too and she’s under some sort of spell with him and needs help of her own. Once it effects my kids, I don’t care about her problems. Only they matter. There is no excuse that will justify her sitting and watching a grown man brutalize my seven year old. 

So, basically,  **What do I do when the end of the week comes and I’m supposed to give them back?** I don’t want to be charged with kidnapping, however, I’m not bringing them back even if I’m mandated to. 

UPDATE: He’s up and we’re on our way to the hospital. I’m having both kids examined just to remain on the safe side. I called CPS and said I’m bringing the kids to the hospital and am scared to return them to their mothers care. Fingers crossed.

Original post here - https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/86t94a/tx_vet_wont_let_us_know_who_has_our_stolen_dog/

We took a copy of the police report from when our yard was first broken into 3 months ago to the police in the county where the vet is. The sheriff's office was very sympathetic and said they would go to the vet to find out the contact information.

The vet willingly gave the information to the police and the police went to the lady's house. She let them in and confirmed that she had been to see the vet last week. She let them look around the house and the backyard but they did not find our dog, or any other dog.

When they started asking about our golden retriever, she refused to answer any further questions and asked the police to leave. The sheriff's office said they don't have enough evidence to do anything to more forward at this point. The sheriff's office confirmed with the vet by description that the woman whose house they went to was the same one who brought in our dog to the vet.

Is there anything else we can do at this point legally? We just really want our dog back home.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/87kiay/update_tx_vet_wont_let_us_know_who_has_our_stolen/,legaladvice,2142,233,0.0

Kid didn't have homework done, and it was bed time, so I said I would drop her at school in the AM if the kid wanted to stay and do homework here and sleep over.

Fast forward 6 days, mom has claimed she will come 'today' or 'tomorrow' just about every day since, then stops texting/answering calls until the time frame passes. Meanwhile the child has a break down every time I prep her that mom is headed to get her at x day/time, says no and that she wants to stay here.

I have gently told mom I will keep the kid as long as needed, I just need to know how long that is. I have bought her clothes since she came with none, I have kept her fed and clean and loved... She hasn't even asked about her mom or cried, which feels so strange to me. :/ what do I do, do I have any legal ability to keep her if her mom never comes back?

Remember how I said that the city prosecutor was all on board to help me finish this? Well, things have changed.

The second pre-trial after the case was continued is coming up.  I contacted the prosecutor to ask why the case was continued.

Apparently the prosecutor went on an extended leave of absence and gave the case to another prosecutor.  Okay, no big deal.  I was given the contact of the new prosecutor, and emailed them to check for an update.  No response.  Two weeks have gone by, and two emails were sent with no response from the prosecutor.  I even contacted the prosecutor's assistant, and no one has gotten back to me.  Dead silence.

To say that I am disappointed is an understatement.  I don't know what to do, because the original prosecutor was so gung-ho about finishing this case and now I can't get ahold of anyone.  This is so uncommon, because when I had questions before, usually I would get a phone call with an answer, and at least an email response.

She refuses to cooperate with police and they dont want to pursue this any further without more evidence. I have the entire thing on security footage.,"Ill skip 99 percent of the details. Short version is I offered OT to any employee over 18 to come accept a delivery at 3 am. This waitress literally jumped at the opportunity of extra cash and volunteered first. One of the delivery guys forced her at around 5 am and I discovered her when I arrived at 7 am. 

The waitress wanted to just forget it ever happened, but I convinced her to at least tell her parents since there was the possibility of pregnancy or STDs. 

The waitress has stopped working for me, for obvious reasons, and has told me they are just going to let this go. I cant. I was going to respect her wishes, until I learned that this guy has done this before. 

In my mind if she is not his first victim, then she will not be his last. I made the decision to report it to the police. They interviewed her and originally said that she was assaulted to the police, then recanted her story. 

The police came to me and told me without more evidence, there is nothing that can be done. I handed over the security footage, all of it for that day, and the guy was arrested. 

Fast forward to two months later and the guy has not pleaded guilty yet. The victim is afraid that she will be required to testify and is dreading the possibility of a subpoena. Because of this I am being threatened with a lawsuit by the parents of the victim for ""emotional distress"" and other bullshit terms. 

Correct me if I am wrong here but unless I actually broke the law to report the crime, they legally cant sue me over this right? By that I mean that any lawsuit that comes forth over this can be easily dismissed because I was reporting a crime that happened right?

Paxpoeta,2018-03-20 07:17:23+00:00,My Ex tattooed my name on his arm AFTER I left him. Now he’s stalking me.,"https://imgur.com/a/Ex5ir


I made a post about this on another sub (/r/cringe) about a year ago. I deleted the original post (within a week or so) because I didn’t want it to get back to him. I didn’t want to upset him. I’m reposting because there are a few things that I wanted to add.



A very brief background, I was 14 when I met my ex. He was 42 at the time. A felon. A predator. When I was a kid, I didn’t have close friends. I wasn’t close with my relatives. I was lonely and sad, but I was optimistic. I figured that if I learned a talent, people would want to be around me. So I took up magic. There was a magic shop not far from my house. My ex worked there. He was friendly and told me everything I felt I needed to hear at the time. Before long, he convinced me to have sex with him. He was verbally and physically abusive. He was manipulative. There was always a reason why I couldn’t leave him: “I’ll kill my dogs or... I’ll kill myself or... I’ll kill you”. I was in that relationship for 6 years. For 6 years I was stuck.



I eventually gained the courage to leave. It wasn’t easy. He still harasses me. Stalks me. For three years he’s been sending me packages, a constant stream of messages and invites… Recently… On Valentines Day, he left flowers on my Dad’s door step because he didn’t have another way to find me (I changed apartments. The address on my license is still my Dad’s, so when you type my name into Google, it’s the only address that pops up)... On my birthday, he left another package at my Dad’s door: a giant cake and two teddy bears.



He tattooed my name on his arm AFTER I left him. He attempted to kill his dogs by starving them to death; it was his attempt to guilt me because I ignored his messages. I believe he did kill one of his dogs because when I was flipping through my Facebook to compile the photos for his post, only one of them is in any of his photos.



I don’t know what to do anymore. I’ve tried ignoring him… For over a year, I’ve completely ignored him. He’s not letting up. He’s not moving on. I am becoming increasingly worried about my Dad’s safety. My Dad is aware of this guy, but I don’t know if there is anything that could be done to keep my ex from visiting his house.

funusernames,2018-03-19 11:44:36+00:00,I’m being sued for taking a vacation by my friend.,"Any advice, and does she have a case?:  Last April an ex  friend got in contact with me asking to forgive and forget the past, I accepted thinking in the 3 years since we spoke, she would have matured. About the 5th text into our reintroduction,  she tells me she’s going to Mexico in May, and if I have any vacation time, could I go with her, all I need is my plane tickets, she has already purchased an all inclusive package for two, 2  years prior with someone else but they don’t speak to her anymore and everyone else bailed on her. I didn’t want to go with her and kept telling her so in the nicest way possible but she kept begging. 

I called her told If I go I’d pay something for the hotel because it seems wrong that I’m going without some sort of contribution I never gave her a dollar amount...she took this offer and ran with it saying ok so I’ll  be responsible for half of her package, which includes a trip to Mexico and a bonus trip to Costa Rica all inclusive. I never signed anything and my name is not on the package. 

While we were in mexico we spoke to the travel agents about the trip to Costa Rica, they said we can book anytime within the next two years. All taxes and fees are paid and that all we need is our flight tickets. 

After that we went back to our room and my friend said she’ll go to Costa Rica with another person she hasn’t seen in a few years. I said great so I won’t be paying for Costa Rica. She got upset and this and things rapidly fell apart. 

she texted me two weeks after the trip  asking for her money. I said I’ll pay her for Mexico, she said no she wants half the package, that’s when I reminded her I’m not going to Costa Rica. Needless to say we went back and forth over Christmas then she filed court documents after I gave her a date that I’d be sending a check for Mexico only, as I never agreed upon a dollar amount and now the offer she gave me has changed.

One of my coworkers recently began called/texted me overnight saying his car was towed while he was out to dinner and he needed a ride to work in the morning. I have never given him a ride nor told him I WOULD give him a ride, but I am the only other employee who lives close to his neighborhood.

I did not see the messages until I was on my way out the door, at which point I responded saying that I was unable to give him a ride.  Since our office is about 7 miles from where we live, I assumed he would take the bus (which has a pretty straight shot to that area), a cab or an Uber/Lyft. Instead he apparently decided to walk to work. I did not suggest that solution, to be clear. Apparently after walking 3 miles he became tired, fell, hit his head and hurt his arm.

He is now threatening to sue me saying that I failed to give him enough notice that I would be unable to drive him. By his logic, he contacted me before midnight and gave me 8 hours notice, but I only let him know I couldn't at 7:45, ""forcing"" him to walk.

https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/83nif5/my_research_paper_is_being_plagiarized_by_a/

So I didn't hear from my professor at all and waited until the end of the week which is Thursday in the UAE. In the meantime I found the full manuscript online where he actually submitted it to an Arab innovation summit to give a keynote on it (I don't think he was selected) since he didn't show up on the list of keynote speakers on the website. Regardless, after finding the manuscript I came to realize that the paper is heavily based off of mine. I've sent the paper in its entirety to my friend working in academia to get his advice once again.

I then followed the advice given and emailed the Business Department chair Thursday noon-ish with my professors manuscript as well as my classmates and my original work, while stating that we're not looking to burn any bridges and want to remedy the problem in a way where no one get's publicly roasted, however there's been no response.

Today is Sunday the first day of the week. How long should I wait? What or how should I follow up if there's no response? Should I be contacting the president of the university next? I'm currently in Qatar so traveling to the UAE would be incredibly difficult due to the political reasons between the two countries, but I'm willing to do so.

MinuteMountain,2018-03-16 15:32:38+00:00,And update and some clarification regarding - Ex and I share an apartment in texas and I recently found out he installed secret cameras with sound in the common areas,"I did speak to the police yesterday and an attorney. I was told not to give my whereabouts and such so my ex wouldn't have my information. 

I am safe though! I just wanted to say thank you for the advice. 

I did get some comments about being nude in common areas and masturbating not in my room so I did want to point out how ridiculous those comments were real quick because it was bothering me. 

You have to remember this is mostly just a two bedroom apartment. My bed is still in the bedroom I used to share with my ex, along with my dresser. My son had his own room before all this so all the things in that room apart from the few items I moved in were his. There are toys and pictures and it is a small kid bed. It seemed inappropriate to do anything intimate in his room so when the house was completely empty, when I knew I was alone and assumed no one was watching I'd hang out in the game room and do my thing. After all, I was never told there were cameras in the house and my ex was at work and no one was there. The game room is much more adult-ish, spongebob plushes aren't staring at me. 

Do you  sex on your kids bed? 

I don't have my own private space. I don't have my own room to masturbate in. Even the bathroom I use is down the hall and covered in bright blues and toy sharks and baby towels. 

The game room is a private place that is comfy and not a kids room and it has a door that locks and shuts, why wouldn't I assume I had privacy there? Hell everything in that game room is mine. The pool table, the couch, the big tv, the mini fridge with the beer in it. It is basically MY room. 

The only stuff my ex owns is a toaster and a dresser and computer station in his, formerly our, bedroom. There is nothing for me to steal in my own home with all the stuff I own. There is no reason why he should be filming anything but his room where all his stuff is. 

EVEN THE LAMPS AND BULBS ARE MINE. He moved in with me. This was my space first. He just brought a few things and signed a new lease with me. 

Even if I didn't have the game room, the living room is still my space. I was never told about the cameras, my ex was at work. No one is home. Why can I not enjoy myself there? On the couch, I paid for in the place I pay rent on. 

It is my home. Have you never had sex in the common areas of your house? Maybe you have a roommate even but they are gone for the long weekend or out of town for a month or so. You assume you have your privacy. 

As for the nudity, our stuff is all over the apartment, not just in the one bedroom. I use the closet down the hall for my clothes because again, I don't have a bedroom or a personal space. I'd, knowing no one was around or it was just my four year old there, hop out of the shower and make my way to the closet knowing no one would see me because my ex was gone and I was never told there were cameras, to grab a dress or a shirt. 

My four year old wears a uniform to his preschool and hates it so we aren't even really through the door fully before he popping off clothes to get into comfy pants so he can play. Maybe he needs to grab some underwear from the dryer right outside the kitchen.  I mean this is standard family living. Maybe it is strange for you but it is so common for us. 

Again, my ex wasn't there and we didn't know there were cameras. We expected to be able to be comfortable and live in our own home without having to be worried about being filmed. 

And yes he is on the lease or else this wouldn't be an issue. 

My friends occasionally drive to come see me. I have some fairly close ones but they live about an hour and a half away. It is pretty far for the daily preschool and work drive. I do have two friends in town but they aren't close. They do visit and we hang out but I don't want to live with them, even for a little bit. One I can't because she has a bunch of cats. 

Anyway, I am safe. I've got some help with this and hopefully this jerkface us alone very soon.

lifeturnedupsidesdow,2018-03-16 00:32:38+00:00,(MD/SE Asia) I just found out my wife faked her death ~5 years ago. WTF do I do now?!?!,"I am reeling right now, its been a couple of days but I am still completely shell shocked by all of this and I have no idea where to go from here. 

I was married to a woman from South Asia for 10+ years. We met overseas and got married here in the US. She became a US citizen, went to college here and had a great job. We have two wonderful children together and a lived a great life in the DC suburbs. She went back home to visit family and while she was there we got the news that she had been killed in a car accident; that was in 2013. Our children were 5 and 6 at the time.

It was obviously extremely traumatic for all of us. It was complicated by the fact that no one in her family speaks English and we were constantly going through friends for translating. Her family is from a village that is not very accessible and definitely  doesn't get much western tourism. She was cremated and I have her remains in an urn here at the house. 

I've tried to keep up with video chats between the kids and their grandparents but it was never very successful because of the language barrier.

Well, a couple of days ago I get a video chat request from her sister and when I answer it my wife is there. I was an absolute mess. She told me that she was just so overwhelmed and couldn't deal with being a mother or living in a foreign country any more. Her whole family helped her cover this up and staged the whole thing for her. She has been living there the whole time.

I'm not here for relationship advice. I've called out of work but I haven't told anyone yet. I've got a session with a shrink next week, but WTF do I do next?

We had a $500k life insurance policy on her that I used to pay off the house and all of our credit card debt. I've still got like $100k of it left in college accounts for the kids. Am I going to have to pay this money back? I don't have that kind of money. I am beyond furious. There is no way I want her back in our lives. I know I will have to tell the kids but I don't want her near them. How do I protect myself and my children? Are we still even married?

BadCarrie,2018-03-15 00:32:53+00:00,*UPDATE* Brother left his 2 children (3 yr old and 9 week old) home alone for over 2 hours in CA,"First of all, I want to thank everyone who commented for their input.  It put my mind at ease and I somewhat knew what I was walking into.  We met with a social worker from CPS on Monday.  My husband and I have had the children for the past week (since they were left alone) but had to bring them home so the social worker could physically see them.  To make a long story short, my brother made a complete ass of himself.  He was obviously high and had probably been awake for a few days.  The social worker required both parents to drug test.  I know that my brother failed and I'm not sure about the mother.  We were there all day waiting for the results of our background checks which never came back.  My husband has an extensive record but was honest with social worker about it.  She said that as long as there's nothing that happened in the past 10 years and there's no crimes against children then there probably wouldn't be a problem.  If anything, he could still be around the children as long I was there and he might have to sleep somewhere else.  I've never been arrested before and have never had any CPS cases against me so I was good.  The children were released to me on ""good faith"" that I was honest about my past (since there was a delay on our results).   A CFT meeting is scheduled for later this week.  That's when a plan will be made for the parents of what they have to do to get their kids back.  So, that's where everything stands as of now.

ComfortableRun,2018-03-14 18:41:01+00:00,Caught HOA trying to break into my house. Now they've issued me a $1000 fine. [WA],"I bought a house 18 months ago which was a member of the HOA. I did change the front door of the house to something a lot more secure. 

About a month ago, in the middle of a weekday I noticed two people trying to open the door with keys which weren't working, I confronted them (while my wife called the police) and it became apparent that they were officers of the HOA trying to look for an infringement.

There is a section in the CC&amp;Rs that says ""the association is entitled to access the homeowner's property with reasonable notice"" and also a section that says ""the homeowner may voluntarily submit the property keys to the association, however once submitted the association is not required to return the keys. Submission of a key which does not work may incur a fine determined by the board"" which according to them, the keys to my property has been submitted (I'm assuming the previous owner have done so).

I have spoken with two board members who said they suspected that the keys that they hold for my property may have been fake and they've authorized their officers to check this out. They say according to them, in this case as they were searching for an infringement, reasonable notice means no notice to ensure that I won't have time to replace the locks.

And now I've received a $1000 fine because the keys submitted for my property to the HOA are fake. I have talked to a board member who tells me that their interpretation of the contract is that once a real key is submitted, the key must be kept up to date at all times or a fine is warranted. 

They also told me to not fight this as according to the bylaws the HOA is entitled to recover their legal fees from me in case I bring them to court or they bring me to court. So I'll lose either way because legal fees will end up costing me more than the fine itself. 

Not sure if it's relevant, but the office of the HOA looks a lot like a leisure room. They have a pool table, a bar with a fancy fringe and a ton one drinks, a large TV and couches and stuff like that. And this isn't an amenity that is available for the people in the neighborhood, this is the ""relaxation room"" for the HOA officers and board members who are all old retired people. I definitely felt like this fine is for me to fund whatever they have going on there. 

Help? I also want to add that this is a house. Not a condo or apartment. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/84fsy4/caught_hoa_trying_to_break_into_my_house_now/,legaladvice,4992,279,1.0

I informed him that his son in law had asked me to find his dad and that I have a very good idea of who it was. 

He did not take the news well when I told him his son in law was probably his son. Lots of screaming. Lots of blaming me. Eventually lots of apologizing to me. I told him I would like to approach this differently as there is the chance he is not the father. I told him to get a dna test done and that I would inform his son in law that his supposed father refuses to meet without a DNA test being done first to prove it. He agreed this was a good idea. His thoughts were on his grandkids asking if it would be a good idea to have them tested for any genetic abnormalities. I told him to hold off until this can be done first. 

I told his son in law the news this morning that his possible dad refuses to meet until he gets a DNA test proving parentage. 

He agreed without any hesitation. 

So now its a waiting game. The lab I use for this takes 2-3 weeks but is very thorough with their work. The dad is scheduled for a swab tomorrow morning and the son in law is scheduled the next day. I did this on purpose to avoid any chance happenings.

PaLandLord,2018-03-12 18:37:40+00:00,PA - [UPDATE] - Storm damaged house. The tenants are out of the house. Yay for the code enforcement folks!,"PA for the LocoBot

Previous thread here - https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8310ny/pennsylvania_i_am_a_land_lord_a_house_i_own/ 

I posted an update in the thread, but it did not actually post? Whatever, here is what has happened in the past few days.

(My dad told me to close the loop with you guys and post this, we do appreciate the discussion and insight) 

I will try and answer a few questions that came up in the thread:

* No illegal activity in the house. Sorry to disappoint. The $5,000 was conjured up by some very bad legal advice by their son. He graduated pre-law a few months ago, hence his living with them now, and for some reason, thought mom and dad were entitled to money.

* We contacted our family lawyer, he sent us to another acquaintance lawyer of his that handled Real Estate stuff. He set aside 30 min for a free phone initial consult, about 12 min in, he told us to call the town and get code enforcement to the house to declare it uninhabitable. He's drafting a letter for us to give to the now old tenants that states that the lease is terminated along with their security deposit. 

* My father said it was strange to report against himself.

* Within about 4 hours, we got a call from a person from the code enforcement department, they declared the house too damaged to live in, told the renters to take what they can now, and spend the night at a hotel. They were given the next day to move everything out.

* We rescinded our offers to help pay for hotel or moving expenses. Not sure if we should be concerned about them coming after us, as we do have it in email/text messages us offing to pay, but we also had a back and forth regarding them making a decision before we sent the code folks out there. Basically said ""agree to leave by tonight and we will help you pay for the move, or lose it."" We got a ""we are not fucking leaving!"" response. 

* When we got to the house to meet with the code enforcement person, the mother and son were red in the face, screaming their heads off at the code person. He actually threatened to call the cops if they did not deescalate immediately. 

* Someone wrote on one of the damaged walls ""FUCK (landlord name)""...we can guess who. 

* Insurance adjuster came out this morning, and will be in contact with us as the damage to the house is in the tens of thousands. 

* There was enough damage in the house caused by the tenants that would warrant us keeping the security deposit, but it seems almost petty at this point because the insurance company is about to cover a lot of damage to the house. Mostly carpet and wall stuff, but the adjuster said they are covering carpet and quite a bit of drywall replacement because of the water damage to it from the holes in the house.  

Anyway, they moved out this weekend, Sunday we had a contractor cleaning up the place, and they are going to start repairs this week. Estimated completion time is 9 weeks. 

This has really shaken my dad up as he thought he had a good working relationship with this family, and for them to suddenly be so awful to them is making him really sad.

LtSgtpvtjohnson,2018-03-12 18:20:54+00:00,TX - I am a private investigator who was hired to find the biological parents of a person adoped in the 80s. Found out his bio dad is the same bio dad as his wife.,"So this guy is not actually a client, just very good friend whoI have been helping over the years try to find his parents in my spare time. 

This is important. 

He is white, and his wife is black. 

In my investigation I learned that the baby was put up for infant adoption by his bio parents. Over the years I was able to track down the information. I will not say how and everyone will probably understand why soon. 

The medical records list the parents by first name only, but that gave me a starting point. It took a few years but I learned the name of his dad and it scared the hell out of me. I confirmed it a month ago, his dad is the same dad as his wife. 

I quickly buried everything I had and have not told him or his wife yet. I then tried to find out how a marriage license was issued as I know they check adoption records to avoid this very thing, but quickly found out the answer. A county clerk got lazy when she saw the mixed race couple and did not do her due diligence. This was a cheap JP wedding with a license issued in just a few days back in the early 2000s. I can understand why this happened as most people would not believe a white man and a black woman are brother and sister. Well half b/s anyways. 

I know that I probably have a obligation to tell them. I know the father as well and have been avoiding him recently. I am concerned about the legal ramifications in all of this. Obviously the marriage would be annulled, but what about their 2 kids? They have a 17 year old boy and a 14 year old girl. 

This is going to ruin the lives of 5 people here, possibly more. 

Moral obligations aside, do I have a legal requirement to report this? He was never a paid client so I have no contractual obligations to him. 

Basically I am just wondering how and where to proceed, or even if to proceed. 

EDIT: No I will not offer my services to anyone here through here. I will not tell you the name of a good PI, we do not hang out together, and I will not tell you how to do my job. 

EDIT2:Going to tell them tonight. Their kids have after school activities till 7 so I can get the dad over there too. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/83x6ib/tx_i_am_a_private_investigator_who_was_hired_to/,legaladvice,3290,284,1.0

[Update 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6sjjwt/update_washington_state_neighbor_is_currently/)

It’s close to a year now that we’ve dealt with the worst of my neighbor. Almost a year ago, we achieved the success of having an anti-harassment order granted. That summer, he was arrested for harassing us, and he stopped with the cameras and the noises.

But something was a-brewing behind those closed doors.

Around early November 2017, we had a knock on the door one evening. It was an officer asking if we had heard gunshots in the area. We had not. Soon into our conversation, he mentioned it was our neighbor who called and complained. They were aware of the situation and assured us that despite the situation, they have to respond to all gunshot calls. I was honestly not surprised that after all the quiet, something started up again.

The next day, a police cruiser parked across the street from our home. I was expecting someone to knock again and ask about gunshots. No one came to the door and the officer sat across the street watching my home for over an hour.

The next day, I emailed an officer I had been working with previously regarding the situation. The officer told me that my neighbor had been calling 911 every single day on my address for gunshots. By the time I got an email back it had been a week.

Every. Single. Day. This man was coming home from work, eating dinner, tending to daily life, and calling 911 on us for shooting guns. The officer said he would look into seeing if this counted as harassment through a third party.

The new year came and went, and in early January, I emailed the officer back and his response was simply that the city prosecutor wanted to set up a phone conference to discuss the plan going forward.

The city prosecutor mentioned to me that at that point in time, my neighbor had still been calling 911 every day. Even the morning of the conference call. She said they contacted all of my other neighbors to see if they heard any gunshots, and asked if they would testify that they have not heard anything come from our property. They also plan to charge my neighbor with some counts of harassment and wrongfully utilizing emergency services.  Part of his deal with the arrest over the summer involved him able to avoid jail time by having good behavior, and they are looking for their time back essentially. His arraignment date came, and his pre-trial was set. Came and went. It’s being continued until next month. 

I am worried that he will try to continue this case until the end of time. Our anti-harassment order expires soon and we will have to drag him to court once again to renew it, and spend more money. Things are starting to feel pretty dim again and honestly, the recent continuance knocked the wind out of my sails. All I can do until I am called as a witness/victim, is wait.

jaidis,2018-03-10 17:39:07+00:00,Child attempting to come into yard with dogs (TX),"Hey legal advice!  There is a mother who walks her 3-4 year old son plus a baby in our alley daily.  We have a solid wood fenced in backyard, and 2 large dogs.  The dogs are only outside with supervision.  Recently, the child has taken to taunting the dogs through the fence by running sticks up and down the fenceline in the alleyway and poking his fingers through the fence.

Yesterday, during one of these encounters, I had my dog by his collar and almost in the house when I heard the gate jiggle.  I pushed the dog inside and went to see what was at the gate.  The child was attempting to open our gate (accessed through our driveway) while the mother watched from the alley!

I took the child back to his mother and asked her what what she thought she was doing?  That our 90 lb dog could easily hurt her child just by knocking him over!  She responded by turning away and telling the child that ""the mean lady won't let you play with her doggies today"".

Legal advice, what do I do?  I do not know where she lives.  Do I call the police on attempted trespassing against a toddler?  There's no law against bad parenting :/  If something were to happen, who would be liable?  My dogs are NOT vicious, but are unused to children and can be excitable.  They walk at different times, so there is no planning and having the dogs in the house.

EDIT: Many people are offering practical advice and also advice that seems geared towards mitigating dog bites and the situations that cause them which I really appreciate!  But I'm actually more concerned about the kid getting the gate unlatched and then getting slammed to the ground or a concussion outside of the yard by 90 lbs of ""want to play"".

EDIT2: Went to home depot and got no trespassing signs.  The gentleman helping me was unable to find a lock that would work.  I will do more research, but he made it seem that until we update the gate itself we may be out of luck.  I will keep looking for solutions to this as it still seems the most practical advice.

EDIT3:  This blew up.  I thank you all so much for your practical advice.  I have tried to respond to everyone so far.  We are going to go with the temporary measure of a zip tie for now  to keep everyone safe until something more permanent can be installed.  My biggest concern now is how to legally stop the taunting and teasing.  As a commentor mentioned, this behavior can easily turn good boys aggressive.

unusually_usual,2018-03-09 21:30:42+00:00,[update] Extreme Door-to-door Solicitation,"First, thank you Legal Advice for helping with my little problem. Once again, the collective minds here are invaluable. For those of y’all that commented and I didn’t reply, I apologize. For reasons beyond my understanding I didn’t receive notifications of comments after a while and I assumed my post had been buried. I’m sure I did something to make that happen, but what, I don’t know. 

My [Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7zgrbr/extreme_doortodoor_solicitation/?st=JEKEUW0V&amp;sh=7dfa369e) wasn’t a hugely fun or exciting post, but I want to provide an update for those interested. 

The first order of business was whipping up a cease and desist to the company in question and made sure that they understood, in no uncertain terms, that I would no longer tolerate their trespass or harassment. I sent this certified mail with signature confirmation the day of my post.

Next, I visited the police station in person and after having been asked to sit and wait and after being passed from person to person for over three hours, I was finally heard and assured that the next time I called my complaint would be handled appropriately. I also left him a copy of the cease and desist I had sent along with a flash drive containing surveillance footage from my home showing the harassment and whatnot. I’m a bit of a digital packrat and just happened to have almost every encounter with these reps filed away. I also gave him a copy of my log that I began keeping about a year ago which included encounters with the reps, the company calls Amanda discussion notes, as well as the dates and times I have called the non-emergency police line, officer names, and the “solutions” they suggested each time. 

The day after I received confirmation that the company having received my cease and desist, I had two representatives at my door. I did not open the door, I spoke through them front door camera telling them that I had called the police for trespassing and that they were not welcome. One kicked my door, calling me a c*nt and tried (unsuccessfully) to rip my camera down. They left before the police arrived, but I was able to provide them with a copy of the footage in short order. An investigation is now open and because of the behavior I was advised to dial 911 instead of the non-emergency if they show up again. 

So, I now have an official paper trail and hopefully I’ve seen the last of these people. 

Thanks again for the quick and helpful advice!

PaLandLord,2018-03-08 21:08:13+00:00,"Pennsylvania – I am a land lord, a house I own suffered substantial damage due to the windstorm last week. I am set to move the family to a hotel or another house I own, all at my (my insurance’s) expense. Tenants are refusing to leave the property, and are demanding $5,000 for the ""inconvenience.""","Hey,

I was told by my son that you all could help. He typed this out for me. I am in Pennsylvania. I am sitting next to him to answer questions.

I am going to skip a lot of the details here, but suffice it to say that the home is almost uninhabitable, more than ¾ of the roof is gone (exposed wood at this point), almost all the vinyl siding is gone, the insulating foam and home wrapping is gone, and the deck and a few windows, and a sliding glass door was taken out by a large tree (owned by the HOA).

There are weeks if not a couple of months of work required to get this place back to normal, and having occupants in there is just going to make it difficult. 

I informed my tenants on Monday that they had two options:  

1. I was going to make arrangements for them to stay at hotel for a short time so that I can get another house I own move-in ready. The house will be ready to move into on Tuesday next week. They can live out the life of their lease; I will pay their moving expenses. This house is about 400 sqft larger than the current house, and is nicer (upgraded appliances, granite counter tops, brand new carpet as of tomorrow)

2. They can get out of their lease if they want to. We can mutually dissolve it right now. I will pay moving expenses too. 

They are refusing to make a decision, as in they have told me that they are under no circumstances leaving the house, and that because the house is now not as well insulated due to roofing, siding, and window damage I will be expected to cover the cost difference in the heating bill. They are staying put for the remaining 16 months on their lease. They then demanded through a text that they will consider moving if I also pay them $5,000. Not really sure where that number came from. 

I’m not sure how to proceed here. I’ve been a land lord for a number of years, this is my primary income and have never encountered this level of crazy before. I have contemplated calling the town code enforcement and making a complaint against myself as a way to get them out, but I am not sure if that will work. 

Do I really have to go through a full eviction process here? 

Help! I have a general contractor standing by to start work as soon as I snap my fingers.

NoOlive,2018-03-07 17:11:52+00:00,Update:My grandmother who is illiterate and starting lose her mind signed a lease for a car she can't afford.,"Hello,

Here is a link to the original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/81lrvo/my_grandmother_who_is_illiterate_and_starting/

First off I would like to thank everyone for the advice they gave. It made me feel so much better knowing that there are great people out there willing to help.

On Saturday I contacted the dealership. They were no help and told me even if it was there grandmother there was nothing they could do. After the phone conversation I felt my next move was to go to the dealership with my grandmother.

At the dealership I spoke to the sales manager and the conversation didn't go well. I explained the situation to him and he said there was nothing he could do because they did everything legally. He said they could not discriminate based off of mental complicity. Then he went on to say that it was the same as him not being able to discriminate based off if someone was ""Black, Asian, etc.."". He then went on to compare it to them asking a woman to speak to her husband. At that point my younger cousin got upset and began speaking to him and he got annoyed then stated ""You are making me not want to help you"" and that ""If this is the case where were you when she was here"". I told him that we needed to step outside to continue this conversation. Outside of the room I explained that what he said came off extremely disrespectful and that the dealership came and picked her up so how would I know this was happening. A few minutes later I realized speaking to this guy was a waste of our time.

I did find out on the bank paper work it said $3,000 ssi a month which is way off. I confronted him about the number and he said my grandmother confirmed it. I asked her in front of him how much she makes and she had no idea. I asked if he verified her income and he said he did not need to. After I left the dealership I had a friend of mine who sells cars look at the paper work and he discovered they had her sign up for a $1700 service agreement even though the terms of the lease would have that car covered through the car manufacturers warranty. He informed me that it seemed they padded the lease as much as possible and that I should inform the bank that she can't afford the lease because it is almost 50% of her fixed income.

I called the bank which is through that car manufacturer and explained the entire situation. The lady on the phone asked me if I was trying to break the lease early. I explained I was just trying to get the lease nullified due to unethical business practice and the fact she not afford it. She transferred me over to customer care and I explained the entire thing there as well. The lady was helpful and escalated the issue to the regional customer service person. She said they would call me the next day (Tuesday).

I recieved a call on Tuesday but missed it due to being in a work meeting. I called the guy back 3 times yesterday and left messages. I also called him this morning and have not heard back. I then called her county APS office and explained the situation. They said they could not help and that I should seek out legal help.

Currently I am waiting to back from the customer service manager and trying to find a lawyer who deals with these situations.

Zanctmao,2018-03-07 14:28:54+00:00,Stormy Daniels lawsuit against President Trump Megathread,"So here is the place to ask your questions on this litigation. This is not the place to attack the President, Ms. Daniels, or grind your political axes. There are ample places on Reddit for that. [Here is a copy of the lawsuit](http://msnbcmedia.msn.com/i/TODAY/z_Creative/Filed%20Complaint.pdf)

So what do we know? 

* This is a lawsuit for declaratory judgment. 

* Declaratory judgment is when one party, Here Ms. Daniels, asks the court to rule as a matter of law what the relative legal duties of the parties are between one another. 

* It is not a lawsuit for money - she is not seeking $$ from the President. She is simply asking that the Superior Court in Los Angeles look at the matter. 

So what is the suit about essentially? 

* Ms. Daniels wants the court to agree with her interpretation that 1) because President Trump never signed it, she is not bound to any agreement with him personally, and 2) that Mr. Cohn's decision to talk at length about his part in it invalidates her duties to him under the contract. 

* She is not asking the court to determine whether the relationship actually happened, or to otherwise opine on the factual allegations surrounding their alleged affair. 

* At most the court would determine that the contract is valid, invalid, or partially valid. 

EDITED TO ADD: 

How is this affected by the [ongoing parallel arbitration proceeding](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/trump-lawyer-michael-cohen-tries-silence-stormy-daniels-n854646)?

* Apparently the arbitrator issued a restraining order, which Ms. Daniels would be violating by filing this lawsuit - assuming the contract is found to be valid. Beyond that very little is known about this arbitration proceeding. 

* Sarah Huckabee Sanders has asserted that the President prevailed in the private arbitration proceeding last week against Ms. Daniels. This means that he is or believes himself to be a signatory to the 'hush money' agreement with Ms. Daniels - otherwise there would be no arbitration agreement.

The Chief Personnel Officer pulled me into his office and made me play everything for him. I told him the full story of eveyrthing about the former employee and the EVPs attitude. 

To make him completely understand that I would not let this get buried, I told him that the former employee knows the whole thing. Said that I planned to leave at the end of the week if the EVP situation does not get handled. (Did not tell him about the new job.) 

The CPO thanked me for my honesty, which by the way was a major red flag for me, and said he would be contacting the COO immediately. 

At lunch I was pulled into a meeting with a junior HR person to talk about my performance review. We do not have performance reviews. 

It went badly. 

I was given 5 minutes to pack up my things at my desk and leave. I had had an email typed up on my phone and sent it to the CEO detailing everything. I had typed it up as things happened and pretty much knew I would be cut today. 

Luckily my access had not been cut yet as I received the CC to my personal email back almost immediately. It received a one sentence response of ""Thank you for bringing this to my attention."" 

So all in all I am pretty sure they will not do anything. They just do not realize how many people are leaving with no notice Friday. A LARGE number of people know. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/82hm3f/update_dbag_boss_wanted_to_screw_over_a_former/,legaladvice,4961,3,0.0
germantous,2018-03-06 11:20:53+00:00,Ex-wife married first cousin and wants to migrate with the children to Nevada from Germany,"We are Germans living Germany. We have 2 children together. They live with their mother and I see them every weekend. 

Last summer, my ex-wife went to holiday to Las Vegas and married her first-cousin over there. Now she wants to migrate to Las Vegas together with the children. 

In Germany it is illegal to migrate to another country together with the children if they under 18 (which they both are) if the dad also has custody. She is bringing me to court now in order to gain full custody so she can move. She is trying to play dirty tricks with lies in order to do that. The chances however are slim that she will succeed.

Marrying your first cousin in Nevada is illegal. In the slim case she does win the trial, I want to block her getting a green card through marriage, by making the marriage void. She has admitted in, which is written in the trial papers, that she married her cousin. 

I have not brought up the fact her marriage is illegal and she apparently either doesn’t know or thinks it wouldn’t be a problem. I am afraid that if I tell her that the marriage is illegal in Nevada before the trial or before she migrates, that she will lie that it is not her cousin and the US government has no way to check that.  The problem is that her cousin has a different last name, has lived his whole life in Las Vegas, and she in Germany. How will I be able to prove that they are first cousins to the US government? I also want to bring this up during court day, with hard proof. But I don’t know how. The only ‘proof’ right now is her casually mentioning it in an interview with child protection services, which is all documented. Her mother and his mother (the cousin) are sisters. His mother lives with him in Las Vegas, but my ex-wife’s mother lives in Egypt (has lived there her whole life). The two mothers do share the same last name. I also would not know how and where to report it to the US government.

Guy who used to work with us a few years ago left on very good terms. He got his MBA and went on to another company at a salary requisite to his skill level. 

Today he comes back for an interview at the company for an AVP position that is a small step up for him. Everything went well in the interview and everyone was on board. 

Problem is the EVP said he is not going to give him the position. He is going to lead him on and make him think he has a job until he hands in his 2 weeks at his current position. Then my EVP is going to just pull the job offer with some bullshit excuse. When I asked him why he would do this, he said the most important lesson I can learn in life is loyalty. ""Stay loyal or never come back.""

Yeah I went ahead and warned the guy about it and told him not to put in his 2 weeks notice. He wants to go ahead and go along with the whole charade just to see how far the EVP will go. 

My question is, is this in any way illegal? I know that a company can pull the rug out from under you in a million completely legal ways, but if there is proof that it was malicious, what can be done?

Thinking about going to HR with this, then a lawyer if they dont do anything about it. Either way I will never work at a company he works at again. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/82blzx/tx_is_it_illegal_to_pretend_to_offer_someone_a/,legaladvice,1632,54,0.0

Thanks for your help and for pointing me in the right direction.

My sister and I contacted the state department, the embassy and the consulate in Karachi. They were able to verify that she exists and she's a US citizen. We told them of what's happening to her and they were quite helpful in telling us what to do and being ready to help her as soon as possible. 

The challenge was getting her into the consulate in Karachi but she actually got herself there (took weeks of planning) where they gave her travel documents to be able to come to the US. We bought tickets for her to go from Karachi to Doha and then to Boston where we picket her up from the airport. 

By the time her parents realized what's what she was on the Doha to Boston flight. Her parents tried to apply for a visa to come to the US but their visa applications were refused. I'm not aware if the people at the embassy who refused it actually knew about my cousin's supituation or not but we're glad they weren't able to come here.

She currently lives with me and my sister and my sister has been granted guardianship over her. Her priority is to learn English. 

Her parents still try to somehow make her return but we've closed down the lines of communication and hopefully her life from now on will be stress-free. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/825ldu/us_citizen_cousin_16f_is_abroad_and_under_heavy/,legaladvice,11885,3,0.0

On that Wednesday she called his gym asking if he had been in (he had) and if his car was in the parking lot. They told her that it was not, that no cars had been there overnight.

Several days elapse, it’s now Friday, and she finds his vehicle at the gym where it had been since Monday. He’s in the vehicle and has been the whole week, this is in Minnesota and this time of year it’s obviously very cold so on top of the neurological damage he’s suffered from frostbite to extremities and damage to his eyes and organs.

He spent time in a coma before we ultimately pulled the plug and he passed. This has all happened in the past 2 weeks.

So this is where I need advice, do I have a case against this gym? I’m hungry for blood and I don’t know what might have happened if we had found him when the gym was contacted.

My landlord had him evicted for numerous reasons. The sheriff came and moved him out. This is all public knowledge.  Two more families moved in here and then finally we moved in. 

Our problems started 1 year ago, but before that nothing. I started getting cards in the mail for this man to surrender himself. I called the number on the card and informed them I have never heard of this man and he doesnt live her. My land lord called the state sheriffs and the county cops to tell them he was evicted 10 years ago. I have personally called and spoke with the FBI, state,county and city cops but still they show up. 

They all show up, at different times...and they bring 5 to 7 men in full swat gear and surround my home..while 2 knock on my door. So far I have been home to meet  them at the door. They tell me if I let them in to talk to everyone and look around they will tell the next agency department that the criminal doesn't live here and they won't bother me. But they lie because the next week, it is another agency.

Not only is this getting old, my sons are teenagers and my concern is that they are going to be surrounding my house one day while I am at work and one of my sons is going to walk outside...not see or hear them and get shot.

PresuredtolieinUT,2018-02-28 17:34:51+00:00,[UT] Parents are trying to get me to lie in court to help my brother out. What should I do?,"Using an alt so this doesn't come back to bite me in real life.

I live with my parents and brother in Utah. I attend the college nearby and I've been unable to move out due to financial reasons so i'm pretty much stuck here. So, about 2 weeks ago my brother got picked up for a hit and run. He ran over a lady (thank god he didn't kill her) but sped off. The women's husband got his licence plate and he was arrested an hour later for driving drunk but they picked him up for the hit and run (they also apparently found heroin in his car.) My parents bailed him out and they have a court date planned for later this week. Now here is where my situation comes into play. This week my parents have been trying to get me to lie in court. They want me to take the witness stand and tell the judge that my brother was home with me at the time he hit the lady so it couldn't have been him. They also want me to say that the drugs in his car are not his but a friend of his who left them in his car. At first I didn't think my parents were serious but my dad just texted me saying that if i don""t do this I ""must not love my family enough to help them out in there time of need"" and that ""You better start looking for a new family to live with"" if i don't lie in court. This seems like a REALLY bad idea and i'm really scared and don't want to get dragged into this. Housing wise my uncle lives only a few miles away and will most likely take me in if I tell him whats going on so i'm not worried about being kicked out, but i'm afraid the'll take my all my stuff if i say no.  What can i do Reddit? Should I play along until i can get out? Can I just walk into the police station and tell them what my parents said to me or should i speak to a lawyer. Any help is appreciated. 

Update 1: Thanks for the help so far guys :). I gotta head to my next class right now so i'm gonna be busy. Im gonna ask some friends there if i can crash there tonight if my uncle says no. when i get done i'll check in for any more help.

Update 2: I got a hold of my cousin (Uncles son) and told him the situation. He told me uncle would be fine with me crashing at his place for the time being and to come to their after school and he would drive me home in his truck to get as much of my stuff as we can.

Update 3: I have one last class i need to head to them im gonna go meet my cousin who will help me get my stuff. Thanks for all the advice and kind words. You guys rock :). When I get the chance i'l check back in and update you guys. Once again, thank you all for the help!

Final update: Hey guys, sorry it took me so long to get back. Me and my cousin were able to get all my important stuff out of my parents house and i'm at my uncles house right now. I just got done talking with my parents on the phone and told them i won't be lying in court for them. From how it sounds my dad feels bad about this whole situation but I don't know if he truly feel that way or not. For at least the time being my uncle said i can stay with them and if I don't end up going back he said he'll help me find a place to go. I wan't to thank you guys again for the help here. I knew it was a bad idea to lie in court but I really just needed someone to tell me it was I guess. If anything else happens i'll update again but for now thank you for the help :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/80xurs/ut_parents_are_trying_to_get_me_to_lie_in_court/,legaladvice,1414,265,0.0

Basically we were stuck for 15 months unable to get her an ID so that she could get a job, take classes, or get on public assistance.

The toughest challenge was proving her SSN. She never made it past 8th grade before her mom kicked her out at 14, and didn't have any actual doctor visits. Her mom had tossed all of her identifying documents (old passport, Social Security Card, birth certificate, etc). 

We tried what seemed to be everything (feel free to read the original post above).

In the end, she suffered a massive panic attack in March 2017 and I had to rush her to the hospital in West Virginia. We were assigned a case worker because they wanted to make sure I wasn't hurting her or anything, and we were lucky to have the nicest lady.

We had no way of proving my girlfriend's identity, but we gave her SSN to the case worker and she was able to look up in the system and verify that the SSN was accurate (she said that she technically wasn't allowed to do this, but wanted to help).

When my girlfriend was discharged, the case worker provided an extra form that had all of her information on it (address, SSN, etc, and again she said she wasn't supposed to do this).

We drove back to Ohio the next day and went to the BMV to try again to get the state ID.

We provided her birth certificate for proof of citizenship, a fishing license for proof of residency in Ohio, and the hospital form as a copy of medical records to prove her SSN. The worker at the BMV had their manager look at it and finally after 15 months, were able to get her an official ID.

We went to the Social Security office and ordered her Social Security Card. The next month it came in. She signed up for Medicaid and had her Emergency Room visit covered.

1 year later we're now doing great. She's working (very close by) and should be getting her actual driver license in about a month.

It's been hell but we got through it. I completely forgot to post a final update on this, but here it is. 1 year and 5 days after the last update.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/80akc3/oh_trying_to_get_my_girlfriend_a_state_id_but/,legaladvice,3221,1,0.0

Haveanotherbeerbitch,2018-02-24 12:03:17+00:00,(MI) Found out my mother used our address to get some guy his state ID card and his social security card.,"Just found out that my mother used our (my spouse, our kids, and myself) address to help some guy she works with get his state ID and social security card. She  lived with us a few years ago and never bothered to change her address on her driver's license. She called to ask me not to throw anything away if I got some mail for this guy. Then she told me that she had to help him out because nobody at the house he is living at has a driver's license (DUIs)  and he needed somebody with a state ID to say he lives at that address.

I'm furious. What did she just do? I'm pretty sure this is illegal.  ""They just told me he could change his address as soon as his license comes in the mail."" That's my mailbox not his. 


My sister works for DHHS. She said people try this crap all the time and the post office probably won't even deliver it. Suspicious mail to someone not registered at that address.

It gets worse.

My mother later told my sister that she had to fill out some papers stating this guy was a tenant at our address. WTF?

What the hell has she done? We own our home, have lived her for 19 years, she hasn't lived here in probably 5 years. In 19 years she has moved into our spare bedroom 2-3 times.

TLDR
My mother used my address to say some guy is her tenant to get him a state ID and social security card. How much did she fuck up? I'm livid! How much trouble are we in and wtf do I do about it?

Update :

I went to our post office and they placed a return to sender order on anything that is addressed to him. Now, I'm going to contact his boss and let him know. His boss is a family friend. Just giving him a heads up that the kid is not getting his ID or SS card. And that they need to go through the legal channels to do it correctly. Hopefully he really is a nice kid and it will be a life lesson to not take short cuts. And if he's a scammer now his boss will know.

throwawayimportant70,2018-02-23 11:58:44+00:00,How to stop someone who is intentionally spreading HIV,"I’m a FTM guy who sometimes hooks up with guys I meet on CL. I have two rules: one that I always use condoms and two that I don’t let a guy have penetrative sex with me without seeing his test results. I met a guy who said he was “hiv negative and clean.” I get to his place and things are going good but a few things put me off to him. I asked him if he had condoms prior to getting to his place and when I asked him for a condom before oral he couldn’t “find one.” I always come prepared and so I just used the condom I brought. He then tried to pressure me into penetrative sex. I kept telling him “not without seeing his test results.” He kept saying “only the tip and only for a second” but I kept declining. He then suggests that I sleep over to which I say no. I felt uncomfortable having him suggest that because I felt like he could do whatever he wanted while I slept and I didn’t want to feel vulnerable. Anyways, after leaving we text back and forth for the next few days and he keeps saying that he wants to have penetrative sex with me to which i repeat my rule. After a few days of this back and forth, he finally admits that he is hiv positive and undetectable. I push him for more answers and it turns out he isn’t on any ARV medication and using “natural” medication. I am livid. I am so upset and i tell him that he is a douche for lying to me about 1. Being hiv negative and 2. Being undetectable when he isn’t on any medication. I tell him that he can not say he is undetectable if he isn’t on ARV and that if he does he is purposely lying and trying to spread hiv to people who may not ask him all the questions I did.

Anyways, I made a CL ad today and this dude responded to me not knowing it was me. I replied back and asked him if he is willing to have “raw sex” and if he is “drug and disease free” an he said yes to both of those questions. I know he is hiv positive and not being treated for it. I am so upset right now because I think he is lying and spreading hiv to unsuspecting FTM guys. ( i know its the same guy because he used the same email handle for both CL ads and listed his # in both ads.)

(Btw I am on Prep and I kept every text message he sent admitting to being positive. I also informed him about saying he is undetectable because my gut told me that he knowing lies and says he’s undetectable and i wanted documentation.)

What do I do? I’m in California 

Tldr; i know a guy is hiv positive and not on treatment and tonight he responded to a post to have condomless sex with “me” and said he is hiv negative. I believe he is intentionally spreading hiv and I don’t know how to stop him. 

UPDATE: 
After reading through all the advice and weighing my own person belief that I do not want to stigmatize HIV positive people, I decided to call my local health department. After being transferred 3 times, I finally got the help I needed.

I spoke with an HIV counselor who seconded what a lot of people said here, that it is no longer “illegal” in California for someone to knowingly spread HIV. What she told me is that she can call this guy in a few weeks, to buffer the fact that he disclosed his status to me recently and I don’t want him thinking I had anything to do with this, and try to get him linked to ARV. She was really nice and said that there are a lot of guys like him and that sadly there is no way to stop them. She said that it was good that I am on PrEp and that I should continue asking for test results because the health department in California can provide it.

This was a major lesson learned for me. It sucks that this guy is knowingly lying about his status and treatment of HIV, but it reaffirmed my belief that you can’t trust anyone. Your health is your responsibility. I hope that my story encourages people to be proactive about their sexual health.

Update #2;
I believe that this specific guy is an abuser. I listened to my gut and it potentially saved my life. 
There were many reasons why I believe he is knowingly trying to spread: his difficulty “finding” any condoms despite being positive and not on treatment (when i asked him which natural treatments he is on he ignored the question multiple times. That dude is not on any natural treatments, it was one of MANY lies), when I asked him why he wasn’t on PrEp and he said he’s too busy but will think about it (why lie and say you will think about PrEp when you know you positive. He knows that HIV positive people can not take PrEp), he kept trying to have PS with me and suggested that I shouldn’t worry since we are using a condom and he is clean, and lastly his numerous suggestions that I spend the night. (I don’t do sleepover because people can do things to you without your consent and record you without your consent.)

If it wasn’t clear in my post, I assume every guy I sleep with is positive which is why I am on PrEp and I use condoms EVERY time. What shook me about this situation is that this was the first time ever that I KNOW i had sexual contact with a positive person and I couldn’t help feeling violated because he lied to me numerous times. I can’t help thinking about everyone else and if they just believe him when he says he’s clean because this dude was a charmer who said all the right things. 

Anyways, it’s better to be safe than sorry. I’m glad I didn’t sleep over and even glader that I’m on PrEp and only performed oral sex with a condom. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7znjc2/how_to_stop_someone_who_is_intentionally/,legaladvice,2287,154,0.0

When I arrived, I noticed I was the only woman in an office of at least 30 people. I just disregarded it as a coincidence at the time, but I now realize it was because of the workplace. I am intimidated on an almost daily basis by my coworkers.

Several of the employees have attempted to make romantic advances on me. These range from awkwardly asking me out (which I don't mind, but I am in a committed relationship, but they still keep asking) to ""accidentally"" brushing their hand against my butt. And these were not one time advances. Today when I came in, there was a new pole that had been installed in the middle of the office.

LiberalFeministChica,2018-02-19 16:20:22+00:00,Being Sued for something Insurance decided I was 0% at fault for,"This is a small claims question.


One year ago, at a gas station, I had finished getting gasoline and pulled out into the (long) line of cars waiting to exit the station and enter traffic. Every 30 seconds or so, someone would pull out and the line would move forward, as lines do.


Well, the person immediately ahead of me wanted to exit the line. He put his Jeep Cherokee into reverse, and backed directly into my car. My car was stationary. My foot was on the brake. He just...backed into me. (Accident occurred in New York State, in Monroe County).


He called the police. The police would not let us speak to each other because he was angry/belligerent, and so they kept us separated presumably so he wouldn't lash out at me. I gave my statement, he gave his. Our statements matched. ""Jeep Cherokee backed into stationary sedan in gas station parking lot.""


There WAS damage to both vehicles. However, a few months prior, my car had been hit hard my a UHAUL (I live in the city with city parking, so the UHAUL hit my parked vehicle, and his insurance had to cover the damage to my car.) My car was scheduled to go in for repairs anyway. So, I didn't pursue this guy for any damages. I thought to myself, ""It's his lucky day that my bumper was already fucked up from a different accident."" I genuinely thought I was being kind!


Both his insurance company and mine found me to be 0% at fault, and him to be 100% at fault, because in NYS, the person backing up has all liability if he hits something in the process. He failed in his duty to check if another car was behind him. (Which, we were in a line...duh, I was behind him.)


The literal DAY the insurance returned with the decision in my favor, he filed a law suit against me for 100% of the damages to his car. It amounts to 1200 US dollars. I cannot even fathom that this is happening. I was served with the notice two days ago. 


Being female, and a ""good girl"" who doesn't tangle with the law ever, my first reaction was cry. My second reaction was blind fury. My third reaction was call my insurance and get them to indemnify me and represent me in court.


My question is...why is he doing this? This seems like an unwinnable case for him so now I am paranoid he knows something I do not know? Because otherwise this seems frivolous and dumb. It's almost like there's something else I don't know about, and he could miraculously win, and I would owe him $1200.

Idontbelieveinblue,2018-02-18 00:09:01+00:00,"[GA] My neighbors kids are coming into my yard, messing with my dog and using my pool and they refuse to do anything. What are my options?","So this all started a week or so ago. I have lived in this house since last September. I have a 6 month old lab puppy and a corgi. Lab puppy is 50lbs but is a big baby. Scared of everything and will run away if you drop a textbook next to her (it happened, she hid behind the couch). Corgi is aggressive to strangers. I have a 6ft wooden fence. 

So about a week ago I noticed that my lab puppy came in soaking wet when I got home from work. I assumed she had been swimming in the pool which was weird because she normally ignores it unless there are humans there. This happened again two days later. Then she started having accidents in the house. She's been potty trained for months so this was also strange. I noticed it seemed like she didn't want to go outside. 

At the same time, my corgi started acting agitated. He sat by the dog door and would randomly run out barking. When both my dogs started acting weird I knew something was up. I bought and set up a cheap IP camera (well, my friend did). Left for work Thursday and came back to find out my neighbors kids had been coming into my yard. Kids around about 7-11 and there are four of them. On the footage I saw my corgi charging one and they ran away laughing. Later they came back with what looked like a hockey stick and when my corgi came near they hit him and he ran inside. They then went and used my pool. 

I WAS LIVID. I'm assuming that they did the same thing to my lab (I don't know why, she's super friendly) when she tried to go swimming with them or something. Anyway, I stormed over to their house and asked to speak to their parents, who basically took a kids will be kids stance and said the old owners let the kids use the pool. I'm young (22 but I've been told I look sixteen) and a girl and I don't think they took me seriously. I told them my corgi was agressive, that I had video footage of him trying to bite them, and they said if one of their kids got bitten they'd call the police. 

I just don't know what to do. My boyfriend was just deployed and I'm overwhelmed and I have no parents or anyone else to ask about this. I'm terrified that I'm going to be held liable if my dog bites one of them or they get hurt in my pool. I don't know what else I can do but padlock the fence, which I did.

Back in Nov 2017, my wife and I were looking for a daycare place for our (then) 4 months old son. We found this order lady who said she'd been doing this for awhile, and had since scaled back in recent years. She only took on infants, and only about 4 at a time. She was close by, had a playroom for the kids, a binder detailing their typical day, and a checklist of the items she needed daily from us (food, diapers, etc). All seemed well.

Skip to now, and for little reasons here and there, my wife and I had a conversation that something felt off about her. For peace of mind, we put an audio-recording device in his car-seat. We listened to it last night and, to say the least, not all is well.

From what we can gather, she leaves our son in his car seat all day long, only taking him out once to change him when he pooped. After dropping him off, he cried for maybe 30min straight, then just seemed to give up. For the next five or six hours, you just hear him blathering, or whimpering, or scratching the car seat. Sometimes he cries, until he gives up. It was difficult to listen to. In the background, you never hear her, just the TV and occasionally another baby crying.

Obviously, he's not back there today, nor will he be returning. We made up some excuse, telling her I'd be staying home with him all this week. We don't want to tip her off just yet, because there are other kids in her care. My question is, what can or should we do about her?

smashfakecairns,2018-02-10 23:18:33+00:00,New York - The teacher who assaulted my daughter 4 months ago was just arrested for possession of child pornography," [UPDATE] [I posted here](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/75razd/second_grade_daughter_assaulted_and_bruised_by/) about 4 months ago regarding an incident where my daughter's second-grade teacher grabbed her and bruised her on the playground.

The school, of course, tried to minimize the entire incident and we had to fight to even have her class moved so that she wouldn't have to continue to deal with that teacher.

Yesterday, a notice came out from the school along with a press release from the state police that this teacher was arrested on 6 counts of Possession of a Sexual Performance by a Child. The arrest came after the second incident with a child where he supposedly made some inappropriate comments. 

This is a teacher who has been in the district for 30 years and had such a reputation for inappropriate behavior that parents warned us about him when we originally got our daughter's class assignment.

Furthermore, he was moved from teaching 4th grade to 2nd grade because 'he did better with the younger kids' according to other teachers at the school. 

The administration was less than accommodating in finding a solution. My emails at the time to both the superintendant and the teachers union were continuously ignored, and it was a struggle to even get her class moved, let alone any sort of accountability on the teacher's part.

After her class was changed, the teacher told his class (that she had just exited) that she was a bad child and they should not talk to her. 

I am absolutely sure that the district has been aware of the problems that this teacher has caused, and that my daughter and the most recent victim are not his only ones. 

You guys were tremendously supportive and helpful when I first posted. I wanted to update you and also see what my next step is in holding these adults accountable for letting this man around children at all.

accusedofnothing,2018-02-09 22:53:43+00:00,[UPDATE ] Arrested after a false police report was filed,"(NYC) 

I was arrested in the middle of September when my previous employer who fired me lied to the police and filed a false report saying I stole my own paycheck which was over $5,000 via Chase quick pay and check. 

Yesterday was my third court appearance date that I was prepared to go to a grand jury and have my own story presented. Chase confirmed that he sent the payment from his primary device from his IP address in a different region of the country. I met briefly with the ADA and my own lawyer giving whatever screenshots of texts I had of my previous employer confirming to sign my own paycheck and threatening me if I did not comply with his directions. 

After 3 hours of sitting outside the court room and the worst experience of my life so far, my case was dismissed. 

My lawyer has been insistent that my previous employer was being retaliatory because I had filed reports against him with department of labor and IRS. 

Over the next few weeks I’ll be taking everything that happened to me in and will pursue legal action against him and contacting the department of labor for over $15,000 in unpaid wages.

This story seems far from over. You guys really calmed me down following my arrest, and I really appreciated it!",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7whcbd/update_arrested_after_a_false_police_report_was/,legaladvice,1960,2,0.0

My ex wife has been ordered to pay $819 a month in support for our daughter, which she did for a few months, but I haven't seen a dime from her since October. Today I finally opened a case with the Dept of Child Support Services and they are going to work on enforcing the child support order. I guess they do things like wage garnishment and, drivers license suspensions, etc. I informed her of what I had done, basically just to let her know that she couldn't pay me any more money directly because it was going to have to go through the agency now.   Now my ex lives in Asheville, is pregnant by a guy who sold drugs (and probably still does) and who just got arrested for choking her out, and she is driving for Uber. It's not a great situation. And she's getting ready to give birth again very soon. Like in the next two weeks or so. She has only seen our daughter once in the last year. Due to some drug use on her part, I was able to get drug testing mandated as far as the visitation situation goes. She has refused all requested urine tests so far, so she doesn't have any visitation at the moment.

Our drug tests are done in house. Yesterday, I went to give my urine specimen, and was told by the HR woman to just leave it in the bathroom and go back to work, that she would check it in a second. 

Today, I get to work and my supervisor congratulates me on being pregnant, and tells me they'll be speaking to me about the position later. Bewildered, I asked what she meant. Apparently I was not only tested for drugs, but given a pregnancy test (not sure how, unless they literally dipped a stick in or used a dropper after the fact?) without my consent/knowledge. 

I left work almost immediately and bought tests on the way home. I am indeed pregnant and have NO desire to keep it, and will be scheduling an abortion ASAP.

No one from the hospital reached out to us until I did some digging. Do I have a case to present?","A little background... my wife and I had a stillborn last fall.  We signed the forms to have him cremated and delivered to us since we lived in a neighboring state.  I called a couple months later to find out the status and was told that they would reach out to me regarding the shipment of remains.  

It had been nearly 5 months now when I still had not heard anything.  I actually posted on r/babybumps to see if this timeline was normal.  It was blatant that this was not the norm, and I went into panic mode to try to contact the hospital to find out what was going on.  

Come to find out, I was told that this hasn't been shipped because a form that was needed wasn't signed.  Not only did anyone from the hospital not reach out to us about this, I was told that the body was still in the morgue and had not been cremated.

AngelOfPassion,2018-02-01 05:20:55+00:00,"[Update] My daughters mother was in a car accident and is in a coma, her grandparents are not letting me see my daughter. [AZ]","One thing I can say before getting into the update is if you are separated and have children, make sure there is an official filing in your states family court that determines paternity (that you are, in fact, the parent of your child) and that you have some form of custody on file with the court as well. Even if it is a joint custody form with only a few hours of visitation it is a document that shows the police that you have some form of custody of your child. The police outright refused to help me in my situation without showing proof of custody and paternity from the Arizona Family Superior Court. 

Here is a link to the original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/762kne/my_daughters_mother_was_in_a_car_accident_and_is/

Update:

Recently I was able to get an official ruling from the court and feel more comfortable posting an update publicly. 

I was able to pick up my daughter from her grandparents home the next day with filing a ""Motion for Temporary Order Without Notice."" The Motion requires you to fill out quite a few other motions and schedule a joint custody trial as well as create a parenting plan before you can submit it for the judges approval. I had to explain, in writing, to a judge why there was an emergency factor involved with me needing to pick up my daughter immediately and the judge, after reviewing my motion, had to draw a temporary full custody order that I could show to the police and other parties involved to allow me to pick up my daughter. 

I talked with a lawyer who was nice enough to tell me the names of the forms I needed to file and how/where to file them without charging me a fee. The down payment for starting a custody case was quoted to me at over $2000 with the other lawyers I talked to before they would even look at the case and another lawyer offered to just charge a per court appearance fee but not help with any forms/paperwork as a cheaper option. None of those options really worked for me so I took the first lawyers advice with the forms I needed to file and did everything on my own.

**I was lucky I had a few hundred dollars available to spend to file this order. I was lucky it was a weekday and the courts were open. Do not count on being lucky. File joint custody paperwork with your state immediately if you have children and haven't done so already. Do not put yourself in a position where someone can take your child and you not be able to do a thing about it.**

After receiving temporary full custody things were pretty straight forward. The document expired every 30 days so there were status conferences set with the court every 30 days until the other party could appear in court. 

I am happy to say there is now a permanent custody agreement in place officially and if anything happens in the future it won't be such a nightmare, I won't feel so helpless and in fear of my daughters safety, and I will be able to show proof that I am legally responsible for her. Hopefully I never need to use this document for this reason again but please don't end up in my situation and file official custody paperwork with the court in your state if you are unmarried and have children. It may save you from a situation such as mine.

Edit because I didn't make it entirely clear: For those of you concerned, my ex has woken up and was able to attend court which is how there is now a permanent custody agreement in place and she seems to be making a recovery.

KryptonianWarrior,2018-01-31 14:32:27+00:00,Can I sue for emotional damages?,"[Ohio] I’m guessing this is a big resounding no but I figure it can’t hurt to ask.

A few months ago a 13-year-old boy broke into our house at night, snuck up to my 11-year-old daughter’s room, took off his clothes, and proceeded to attack her. He had a knife with him. Thankfully, my daughter had enough courage to scream at the top of her lungs as soon as she was woken up by him. He freaked out, we woke up, and ran after him out of the house as fast as we could. Yes, he literally ran out of the house naked in 10° weather.

Anyway, the police found him a couple of hours later and he’s been in jail since then. Yesterday was his sentencing. If he exhibits good behavior, he’ll be out in nine months (one year total from the incident). The rest of the details aren’t really important to my question here.

This whole thing has turned our lives upside down more than I would have imagined possible in such a situation. All of my kids are terrified to be at home even three months later. My daughter that was attacked has been sleeping in our bedroom every night. She can’t be left alone for even five seconds. I’m talking she won’t go into the kitchen alone to get something from the fridge even if we are sitting in the living room next to the kitchen. She reports that she thought he was trying to kill her and thought her life was over. Extremely traumatic for an 11-year-old. Yes, for those interested, she is in trauma therapy.

Last night we “hypothetically“ asked her what she would think if this boy got out of jail sooner than we had originally thought and she instantly crumbled, bawling hysterically. It broke our hearts.

The boy’s family lives two blocks from us. Rest assured I will not have my daughters sleep a single night in our home if he is released from jail and his family has not moved away by then.

Since no property damage took place, and even the trauma therapy is covered by a government grant, I’m wondering if there is a possibility for suing for emotional damages? I am not the type to jump at suing someone or trying to solve my problems with money, but talking with my wife this morning about the possibility that we may have to move, sell our house, etc., even though we are the victims and that’s entirely unfair to us, it might be a real possibility/necessity.

My insane Christian MIL hates me. I listen to Metallica and Megadeth, therefore I am the reincarnation of Lucifer.

Yesterday I was changing our son's (6 months old) nappy, he had poop all over the place, because he's a baby. I cleaned around his anus and my MIL shreaked at the top of her lungs:

""You just sexually abused your son! You fucking vile pig."" Our son, obviously almost jumped off the changing table with shock and was in hysterics. 

MIL started slapping me around the back of the head, shoulders and back.

Wife came in and almost had to carry MIL out of the room. I'm in a state of shock, I have to calm our son down and finish cleaning him. Can hear MIL and FIL raging in the background. Hear the front door slam.

MIL now says she's calling CPS and has reported the ""sexual abuse"" of our son.

What's my recourse here? When CPS show up, do I bar them from entering and explain the waste of time they're in for? Do I let them in? Do I hire a lawyer and look for a cease and desist?

I'm worried about letting CPS in because people have told me that they will take a dim view of me (the father) being the one looking after him while my wife is working. Is there any truth to that?

I'm fairly certain she will call CPS because she has called the police on me in the past for driving my wife's car.

ftdogein,2018-01-29 02:20:56+00:00,(IA) City planted trees and then put in a sidewalk. Now tree roots are growing under sidewalk and they want me to pay for repair.,"9 years ago the city decided to plant trees along my street.  I specifically requested that they exempt my property from this and attended every meeting on the subject, but they did it anyway.

Last year they put in a sidewalk as well.  Again I wasn't a fan, but again I couldn't do anything to stop them other than ask them not to (and be told no).

Now I have received a notice from the city that the sidewalk is uneven and damaged, and I need to pay to have it repaired. They said I can choose one of a number of local companies and hire them personally, or the city will get it done and bill me.

A family friend came out and looked at this, and he said that the sidewalk issues are definitely being caused by tree roots.  He said that I could technically go for a cheap repair that involves spraying foam under the sidewalk to level it, but that he doesn't believe it would hold very long in this case. The sidewalk is also cracking in several areas and he said that once a square cracks, it will typically just get worse and worse until it starts to crumble. In other words he thinks the sidewalk needs to be ripped up, the roots need to be dealt with (as they will otherwise continue to grow) and the sidewalk will have to be redone. He did not know much about the tree other than that it is a much larger tree than is usually planted in the right of way area, and he believes that is why its roots are so bad. He also said that he thinks the tree has a long way to maturity and the root problem is only going to get worse.  However he said that he thinks (and I agree) that the city should be the ones footing the bill on this, not me, and that I should urge the city to take care of it themselves.

My obvious gripe here is that I bought a property with NO trees and NO sidewalk, they arranged for both, and now I'm stuck with what are looking like very expensive consequences.

At first I figured the city just didn't realize that it was their own tree causing the problem. I responded to the city in writing and followed up with several phone calls explaining my position, but am pretty much being told ""tough luck"" because upkeep of the right of way in front of my house is my responsibility. The city even agrees that the issue is caused by the tree roots, they just don't care. Frankly I have been annoyed enough having to pay for leaf cleanup and snow removal and now being told I am on the hook for what could be several thousand dollars adds a lot of insult to injury.

I am wondering if this is likely to be worth fighting / if I have a case.

I have the whole thing on video.,"Yesterday my neighbor’s rabbits got out of their cage. They ran into my front yard. She comes over and tries to catch them with her grandson and granddaughter. 

One of my cats walks close to them. She tells her grandson to “get it” and he proceeds to kick the cat repeatedly until it runs away and hops up on my front porch. (I should add the cat was nowhere near her rabbits. He is just a very friendly cat and was coming to greet the neighbors.) Then the grandson hops up on my porch picks up a large plastic bowl my kids left out and starts whacking my cat in the head with it. His grandmother was watching the entire time and said nothing. 

I caught the entire thing on my nest cam. I wasn’t home at the time or I would have confronted them as it happened. What should I do? Should I even try to call the police?

Edit: Called the police. Showed them the video. They said the boy’s actions were not ok, but filing a report would basically amount to nothing. They did offer to go speak with them. My husband walked outside and heard the lady yelling at the police officer. 

Thankfully Mittens is fine. https://i.imgur.com/JQ4hk36.jpg

luckysilverbell,2018-01-20 10:31:10+00:00,[UPDATE] $400 pet fee for a cat I don't own,"First things first, thank you everyone for all the help! I've settled things with management, and no longer have to pay the fees. The reason behind that is something I just had to share with you guys.

I managed to catch the cat after leaving a few bowls of food, and it turns out he does have a collar. It's just hard to see under all his fur. So I looked at the tags, hoping to find an address. There was one engraved into one of the tags, but there was just one small problem: The address was mine.

Luckily, there was also a phone number, and this one wasn't mine. So I dialed the number, and it turns out this cat (Butter) belongs to the people who used to live in my apartment. They moved to a condo across the street, and forgot to get new tags for Butter.

I explained my situation, and asked if they could tell management what was going on. They did, and less than an hour later, I got a call from the leasing office. They apologized for the ""misunderstanding"" and said I no longer had to pay the fees. Naturally, I made sure to get that shit in writing. I don't think Butter will stop visiting my balcony, but as long as I'm not getting in any trouble because of it, he's more than welcome to drop by whenever he feels like it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7rpoz7/update_400_pet_fee_for_a_cat_i_dont_own/,legaladvice,2773,2,0.0
mallow_baby,2018-01-18 11:14:21+00:00,[PA] UPDATE: My ex has nude photos of me and threatens to send them to my current partner - can I do anything?,"Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7r12hs/pa_my_ex_has_nude_photos_of_me_and_threatens_to


My post was not hugely popular, but I have a small update. Thank you to everyone who commented on my previous post, I read all of them, even the ones I didn't reply to immediately.

I called the police last night. An officer came out to my house, he read the messages, saw the photos, and said, ""Yeah that's illegal and I don't think it gets much easier to prosecute than this."" He had my fiance send him screenshots of everything and then the photos separately. He took my ex's information, our information, and the surprisingly ample amount of information I have on his girlfriend. 

My ex is currently on both probation and parole, so the officer is reaching out to his PO today for a current address since he refused to provide it to me. He'll be calling my ex today, and if he hangs up on him or gets smart, he'll be prepared with an address to just go talk to him. He also knows where he is working this evening while the officer is on duty, so that is a last resort.

He is also going to run the evidence and our statements by the DA's office today and get the green light to proceed with charges, which apparently will include an actual arrest once everything that needs to happen happens. I'm not clear on the details exactly, I just know that they are almost certainly going to be charging him with a misdemeanor 2. 

Additionally, I am almost positive that my ex's current girlfriend, who he has been with for roughly 9 months now, was involved in some manner. She is an RN, so if it comes to light that she was complicit, she could also be charged and lose her job. I don't know how it would impact her license as an RN, but I did work for the hospital she works for currently, and any charges, no matter how minor, result in termination. The officer confirmed this, as well. 

And I took everyone's advice - I contacted my attorney. He is drafting a cease and desist letter to send to both my ex and his current partner. He is also going to request a copy of the police report to add to the already massive stack of evidence of reasons why he should not get custody of either of his kids, he should remain strictly on visitation, if he's lucky enough to even get that.

Thank you everyone, I have a small amount of hope that this will work out favorably. My current partner doesn't care what he has to say or what pictures he sends, he sees it every day. He also knows that my ex is vindictive and is grasping at straws in an adult temper tantrum. Hopefully this will end the years of this crap from my ex, as this is not the first partner he has done this with. It's just finally a charge in PA!",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7r911r/pa_update_my_ex_has_nude_photos_of_me_and/,legaladvice,14062,3,0.0

Original Post: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/76strr/tx_pecan_tree_severely_cut_back_by_trimmers_who/

So my MIL had an arborist out who judged that, with some work and care, the tree should be able to survive the damage. By his appraisal, there was around $5500 in damage to the tree. Sadly, the photos my MIL was able to dig up weren't enough to let the arborist give a good estimate on how much the tree's nut production would be impacted, so she just went forward with that number.

She had a lawyer friend draft up a registered letter to the tree trimmers explaining the arborist's appraisal and her intentions to pursue repayment through whatever legal means were necessary. The trimmers came back with an offer to pay that amount but in 3 installments over the next year. She countered half immediately and half in a month. Two weeks later she gets contacted by the trimmer's insurance company and they sent her a single check for the full amount.

Wife is 12 weeks pregnant we decided to be proactive and talk to our employers after telling close family so they can hear it from us before the rumor mill.  Wednesday this week I sat down with my boss to let him know and discuss how to best plan projects around the time I'll be out in six months.  On Thursday I got a meeting request for a ""planning meeting"" that afternoon, not thinking anything about it given the previous days conversation, until my boss is walking me down to HR.

HR informs me my position is no longer needed and that the layoff is not performance based.  They offered a small severance and then inform me they'll be hiring a new position in the department and that I'm welcome to apply.

This was a non-union job.  There were no other layoffs in the company. There have been no talks of restructuring or downsizing in our department.  I had a good performance review last quarter, just like every year I had been there.

Besides the loss in pay, we used my medical insurance and my wifes employer doesn't offer any, so I'm feeling pretty hung out to dry about the whole thing.  Aside from trying to negotiate a better severance package, was this on the up and up?

EDIT: Not on the up and up.  Per Gavinmac, FMLA notification is a protected action upheld by Wehrley v. American Family Mutual Insurance Co, and after reviewing the case law to confirm that it's a good fit, I am contacting an attorney this morning.

I'm currently a law student (2L) and my mom is really starting to make me worry.

She's a very verbally aggressive and entitled person. Anytime something doesn't go her way, she immediately starts screaming law suit when 100% of the time she's at fault or doesn't have a claim anyways.

Recently, she took her cat to the vet to get vaccinated. A few days later, the cat was very sick and would scream if carried. My mother took the cat to the vet, but informed them she was refusing to pay for the visit or any tests because she just knew it was their vaccine that made the cat sick and therefore the office was at fault and should eat the cost. 

Understandably, they said no. My mother announced she was going to sue them, that it was unconstitutional for them to deny her cat free care (I don't even), and that I, her child, was an attorney and was going to sue them for everything they had. She left them my information. 

I got a call from the vet's attorney who wanted to talk about the matter. I immediately interrupted them and let them know that (1) I was not an attorney, (2) I never agreed to represent my mother in the matter, (3) I could not legally represent my mother in the matter, and (4) I was terribly sorry about this. I explained how my mother did this all the time. The attorney understood and let me go.

While nothing bad came out of it, I'm worried someone will report me to C&amp;F for unauthorized practice of law if my mother keeps this up. I have repeatedly asked her to knock if off, but she just won't. She's also given her friends my information to get legal advice from me and I have to keep telling them that I can't help them.

I called my daughter last night to pick her up but she wouldn't answer. I didn't think too much of it because she usually doesn't pick up on the first try. I went to the place she was supposed to meet me at 9pm. She didnt show so i called her ""friend"" she was supposed to be with and she wasnt at her house either. Eventually she shows up around the corner, stumbling. She was clearly intoxicated and her breath confirmed it as she got in the car. I questioned her and eventually got the truth out of her. She was with her boyfriend. Ok, i get it she wouldnt want to tell her dad about it but why are you drunk?. Who is this guy that has access to booze? How old is he? She revealed his age and my whole perspective changed. 31 yrs old. Older than my oldest son. 
It broke me. 

As a father, and most importantly as a man, i assumed the worst. And sure enough, it was the worst. I opened up her phone only to sink even lower. I dont know how a 30 year old man can talk to a teenager like that. there was a plethora of  sexual exchanges between them in writing and pictures. She met him at her job at a local furniture shop. She was doing good in school so we thought she would be able to handle a little more responsibility, she had the desire to work, after all. We started seeing a radical change in her attitude and persona. We caught her on drugs, skipping work, skipping school and all those times, he was with this person. 

This is where my dilemma comes in. I am dead set on sending this guy to jail but i dont know how to proceed. Do i have something here? Should i contact the cops, a lawyer? What should i do? Im a little desperate and i feel like a failure. I know kids are supposed to be this way i just never thought they would be mine. Thank you in advance for you responses

Friend reports this to the other manager working that day and is told to let it go because that’s just how the other manager is. Friend then reports it to corporate HR and gives her statement. 

The store manager then let’s her go at her next shift before she got a chance to hear back from HR.

I have called multiple law offices but no one is returning my calls. Somebody please, please help me.","About three weeks ago, I was admitted to a psychiatric hospital due to various problems. It's a long story, but the short version is I have schizoaffective personality disorder and I was not taking my meds properly. After I was stabilized, I was discharged, but it has come to my attention that something is terribly wrong.

The hospital has placed a wire in my arm that I believe acts as a tracking device. It is quite obvious, especially when I flex my arm-- I can see it bulge in my wrist. I tried to take a picture but imgur is not letting me upload.

This has caused me great distress. I stay locked in my house because I'm afraid of going somewhere or doing something ""wrong"" and getting forced back to the hospital. I've also become concerned about my medications. If the hospital staff inserted a wire without my consent, what have they done with my meds? I have Zyprexa and haldol, but I dare not take them now.

I have a few questions about the legal aspect of all this:

1. The insertion of the tracking device without my consent-- surely that's not legal? My understanding is the patient has to consent before a medical procedure is done.

2. The distress caused by this, does that count as damages? Should I sue?

Bostonsexylathrow,2017-12-28 18:09:07+00:00,Update: Landlord threatening to evict me for having (gay) sex in my apartment. Good news!,"Well, here's my update! And with good news!

So first of all, I just wanted to say: wow. The amount of support I received, both in replies and in PMs, was absolutely amazing. Everything from fantastic advice to hilarious commentary. The person who said ""Sand is a weird name for a guy"" had me in stitches.

That said - I feel like people assumed a much worse picture of my landlord (people telling me to buy cameras, etc). He's a nice enough person, but has some very problematic views. He grew up in rural (Arkansas, I think? That or Alabama) and came to MA later in life. This was his first time being a landlord, so he still had the idea in his head that it was ""his house"", so to speak. That, coupled with the fact that up till now he'd avoided even talking with people who were openly gay, led to a lot of ignorance.

I know some of you were hoping I'd screw him over for all he's worth, or torment him with daily updates of my gay agenda, but alas, I decided to take the calmer approach, and it seemed to work. 

Yesterday I sat down with him, and first laid out the various information that you guys helped me find. Everything from sexual orientation being a protected class, treble damages, and the fact that those old laws and 100% completely unenforceable. He realized VERY quickly that he was in the wrong, and he has fucked up bad. He also admitted that even he didn't know what he defined as ""the sin of homosexuality"", or how he'd enforce the fine. He just kneejerk reacted to the (to him) shocking news. 

We ended up chatting for about 2 hours then, and it started with me dispelling a lot of misconceptions about gays (some of his notions were comically bad - like, if I weren't having the conversation with him I'd think he were a caricature). He's a lot older than me, and his kids recently moved across the country (and he was renting their house for him), so I think he had some notions of being a father figure to me, and thinking he could ""lay down the law"" or ""set me straight"". He seemed genuine, and seemed to be legitimately concerned for me and my soul. I reminded him to hate the sin and not the sinner, and that seemed to resonate with him.

He still doesn't agree with homosexuality or my lifestyle, but he's willing to accept it. He seemed to be earnestly trying, and in my mind that counts for a lot. He agreed to write both me and my boyfriend a letter of apology (which I will be keeping copies of in case this matter comes up again and needs to go to court).

The past few days have been super stressful, but it seems to be resolved. If things go well, I might even potentially renew the lease come September. I'll still be on guard for any shenanigans, but I think I'll leave the issue where it lies for now. If this was all a ruse or him backpedaling, I'll go at him with everything I can in the future - but for now I'm satisfied. I'm truly appreciative of all the people who offered advice and moral (and immoral!) support in the original thread.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7mo8qv/update_landlord_threatening_to_evict_me_for/,legaladvice,17445,4,0.0
BbyLemonade,2017-12-28 14:17:26+00:00,"My employee contract said I would have health insurance, but is now my boss is saying we don't have it because ""we don't need it."" What do I do?","I left my old job for my current job in June, and part of the agreement was signing an employee contract with a non-compete, that also included other tidbits of information like my salary, vacation time, ect. It also spelled out in this contract that I would pay $214 and they would pay $214 for my employee health insurance which I would be eligible to enroll in the employee health plan after 90 days. They also attached a plan that was an HMO to show me what my coverage would be and said, via email, that I would get a larger packet upon employment. 

I've held onto my signed contract (they never sent me a copy of the contract they signed) and when months passed after those 90 days, and I still wasn't enrolled, I asked her about it a week ago to see what was going on. She said that there is no employee health insurance plan because we don't need it, but that we could ""shop around"" after the first. I asked her if that would be the same plan that would be in my contract and she said ""no, it would be a new plan."" I made sure this was all communicated via email. Yesterday, she comes into verbally tell me that she's still waiting to hear back from the insurance people and that they'll most likely be purchasing a standalone plan from this company for me as an individual (different than the one that was sent to me) and that I would probably have to physically go to their building to sit down with an insurance sales person. I looked it up, and they don't offer HMOs and I'm assuming this is going to be more expensive than what was offered. Part of the reason I took this job was because the HMO was similar to the one I had at my old company.

Another weird thing that happened before getting hired (I also have this in email) is that the manager said I was one of their top candidates asked how old I was because they used that to ""factor in costs,"" of top the candidates for things like ""health insurance."" This leads me to believe I might be making less money because of that.

I don't know what to do next, how to continue approaching my boss or what to say to her, and if I'm in the right or wrong here. 
Any and all advice would be GREATLY appreciated. 

********Update: My employer called me into her office to say this is 1. My fault since I didn't say anything sooner, 2. That I am going to have to call an insurance company myself because there's nothing she can do because I don't live in NJ and open enrollment is over and 3. Tried to pretend we talked about this before and say that I ""knew."" I told her I had no idea what she was talking about.

When I pushed about the numbers in the contract, she acted like it wasn't there, so I resent it to her and she said ""I don't know why it says that. That's not true. I don't know where those numbers came from. That insurance plan we sent you was a sample plan.""

So I'm contacting a lawyer before I quit to make sure I have my bases covered. Thanks for the advice and hope this never happens to anyone else because I feel like I'm going to have a nervous break down!

I rent an apartment from a man who lives down the street. It's a nice enough apartment and up till now I've had very few issues.

The problem is he's rather... conservative, and I'm rather... gay.

Once he found out that my boyfriend wasn't just a friend who spent a lot of time with me, he tried to bar him from coming over. I told him to ""pound sand"", as it goes.

Now he sent me a letter stating that effective immediately, there shall be a $250 fine every time I ""commit the sin of homosexuality"" in my apartment. If I refuse to sign the addendum, he claims he will file to evict me due to breach of the lease, specifically the clause that the premesis shall not be used for illegal activity.

He cites MA state code that criminalizes fornication (sex outside marriage), and ""crimes against good nature"", which he insists means homosexual relations (the statute does not define it any further). 

I looked them up, and they are evidently real crimes. I know they're not enforceable by any stretch, but have I technically done ""illegal activity"" in my apartment?

I really don't want to move early (lease started in Sept), or have an eviction on my record.

I know this seems absolutely silly, but the fact that they are still technically crimes in the book gives me a little pause.

Do I need to take this seriously, or can I start coming up with more ways to say pound sand? What should I do if he does try to take further action?",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7m9zdu/ma_landlord_wants_to_fineevict_me_for_having_sex/,legaladvice,6541,227,1.0

GrubbyButthole,2017-12-25 04:14:42+00:00,[OR] My neighbor is asking for compensation after I cut down my apple tree,"On Monday I cut down an apple tree that has been on the property I own since the 1950’s. The apple tree sat 5 feet back from my property line on either side. But did hang over into my neighbors property.

On Friday my neighbor behind me came out yelling and complaining, that I have ruined his home property value by cutting down the tree. He also demanded that I pay him for cutting down the tree because apparently the tree was one of the reasons he bought his house. He also said that he will be missing out on the fruit now that it is gone. I figured I could ignore him, but tonight I came home to a letter demanding that I compensate my neighbor for the tree.

It was my dang tree that was diseased and my neighbor wants me to pay him... Can he really do that?  Or is he just blowing smoke?

Edit: I went over this morning and spoke with my neighbors wife. She was a bit nicer than her husband. I explained to her that the tree was diseased and needed to come down. But that I had plans to plant a new apple tree and possibly a peach tree as well. I also notified her that the other tree on my property (a very large red cedar tree) will be cut down early in January. She said her husband will probably be upset by this as well.

Totalityclause,2017-12-24 15:53:55+00:00,Fired from hotel for refusing to check in a guest making death threats,"I'm gonna try to make this quick easy to follow. Franchised chain hotel in Colorado. CO is an at-will state.

A couple weeks before this happened my GM told me that my AGM was wrong in saying that we had to get approval in putting someone on the do not return list or refusing to check someone in. We are the ""front line"" so to speak.

A guest has been staying with us: a homeless man, living in our hotel or his truck, has been making a new reservation last minute online every day for crazy cheap. He has also been making some awful comments about other employees that worked there. Slurs, things of that nature, as well as the phrase ""I don't have a gun, but if I did I would shoot her"" in reference to a female employee he'd already insulted multiple times.

He made a new reservation a couple of days ago, and came to check in while I was talking to my AGM. I told her I wasn't comfortable checking him in because of death threats, harassment, and I think that's more than enough, and that I didn't think he should even be on property.

Long story short, she refused to listen to me, even after reminding her what her boss had told me but a week or two ago about us being a ""front line"" or whatever. I fully refused to check him in, moving past ""not comfortable"" hoping she would understand how severely I believe this person shouldn't be here, but instead she checked him in in front of me.

Two days later (Christmas Eve of course) I get fired for ""insubordination."" It's around a week until my 1 year, and I only had one warning on file for showing up late without calling.

Now the at-will nature of my state makes this difficult to do much more than getting unemployment, please correct me if I'm wrong, and I'm not horribly worried about getting new employment, But is this not the employer allowing harassment? And encouraging an extremely unsafe work environment? 

Any advice would be appreciated. This just feels very.. *un*just.

EDIT: Please guys. I don't give a shit that I was fired. I give a shit that someone is allowing harassment and threats to continue in a workplace, and need advice on making sure my ex coworkers are okay or literally anything.

Stop trying to lecture me. I got fired over my morals and I'm perfectly fine with that.

KayleighAnn,2017-12-23 12:56:08+00:00,"[UPDATE] [MI] I sell handmade items on Amazon and Etsy. A website is taking my photos and descriptions and selling them as their own, I am not the only one.","Last Sunday, I checked my Amazon account and started browsing the seller forum, and found a thread about a website that was stealing listings and from Handmade on Amazon sellers. I was curious and checked the website, and sure enough about 80 of my listings were there.

[Previous post here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7kdvic/mi_i_sell_handmade_items_on_amazon_and_etsy_a/)

I had no idea my post would get so much attention! Most of the advice was very helpful, some was a little misguided, and only very little was unhelpful (to the guy who pm'd me because you're not allowed to comment on this sub, there's a reason for that).

The first thing I discovered that was incredibly frustrating, Amazon sellers are NOT allowed to watermark our photos! I am looking into workarounds, like printing out my logo on a card to photograph with the product.

To clarify a few things quickly: 
- I am not raising my prices to match the drop-shipper, it's not fair to my true customers and in all honesty a plastic bracelet is not worth $20 in my eyes. 
- I know that drop-shipping is legal, that wasn't the issue at all. The problem was they were using my photos and listings without my permission, some of which were outdated photos and didn't represent the items correctly anymore (mostly due to color changes, different materials, ect). This resulted in several returns that I have to pay the shipping on, and can't collect a restocking fee on. 
- When they make the order from my shop, they are creating a temporary account for their buyer. All I got was their username, which matched the shipping address. No easy way for me to determine if they were a direct customer. 
- I do include a business card with every package. I am also going to start including invoices, it takes an extra step to do but it's not something I should have been skipping. Etsy prints them for me automatically, so I was just being lazy.

I did contact their ""support team"" and got a generic message back. With the team of Amazon sellers I was working with, we all submitted DMCA takedown requests on Shopify, and it was resolved within a day. The website has been shut down, and we are much more familiar with how to take care of this in the future. I'm setting up a Facebook group for the sellers later so we can communicate easily with each other as well. I'm also registered on Pixsy now, which may help in the future if someone is using my photos for their own profit again.

In the meantime, I am taking a well deserved break. There are still a few orders trickling in, but I will tackle those after Christmas. I am sold out of ornaments and candles, and have had several good reviews popping up on Amazon which makes me feel great!

Confusedparent32,2017-12-22 16:53:28+00:00,"North Texas school is threatening to expel my 11 year old son for ""Gun paraphernalia."" Or a Halo shirt for those with brain cells.","So my son's school normally wears school uniforms. However as a sort of christmas present to the kids they let them wear whatever they wanted last week. (They are out this week.)

Each day my son wore a different video game themed shirt with no issues. Last Friday he was written up for an inappropriate shirt and was given detention to be served that saturday by one of the assistant principals. The shirt in question has masterchief holding an assault rifle from Halo 5. Yeah...

So I go up to the school last Friday and get the punishment eliminated by the principal. He thought it was stupid to punish a kid for a video game shirt in the first place. 

I thought that was the end of it. Nope. Today, as in 3 hours ago , my wife calls me up and says to come up to the school. They called the two of them in to talk about punishment for my child. 

The word I kept hearing is gun paraphernalia over and over again in this meeting. They wanted to expel my son. Not suspend, not detention, not even alternative education, expel my son for a fucking halo shirt. 

It was clear that the superintendent was trying to force the issue as she kept directing the principle and assistant principals in what to say. During the meeting they treated him like he had done something wrong as well. They legit made him apologize for wearing the shirt. My wife interrupted him and told him he did nothing wrong and had nothing to apologize for. I then demanded an apology for their treatment of my son. 

They didn't. We left. 

I am pretty furious right now mainly because they chose TODAY to do it. Three days before christmas when they damn well know that  we wont be able to do a damn thing about this until Jan 3-4th. 

Not entirely sure what to do here. Do I need a lawyer on this? I know one of the school board members, her husband and I used to play halo 1 and 2 when we were teenagers so there is that.

ChurchillianDawn,2017-12-22 08:16:06+00:00,Child Buried in My Family's Gravesite,"This all took place in New Jersey.

Years ago, my brother passed away at the age of eight. He has been buried at a local cemetery, and since his death, my parents purchased the plots of land to the left and right of him, so that when the time comes they can be buried next to their son. They have the documentation to prove that they have been the rightful owner's to these spots for several years.

We visit the grave often, and up until about a few years ago, my parents were there every week. My parents are now getting older and becoming less fit to maintain the grave's upkeep. Since I'm now a teenager, I often drive down to the cemetery to check on the grave (brush away any fallen leaves, plant flowers, etc.). 

About a week ago, I went to visit the grave as usual. 

Upon arriving, I came upon something incredibly wrong: there was a baby buried in a gravesite that my parents own, right next to my brother. Someone had dug up a grave that belongs to my parents, and buried their child there. 

My first reaction was to call the number listed for the graveyard to report this mistake. A man picked up, and once I explained what had happened, he quickly informed me that he was the owner of the graveyard. Turns out, the baby is his grand daughter. His daughter had a baby that passed very shortly after birth, and she selected an open plot owned by my family to bury the child in. 

I was completely struck dumb, and couldn't think of much of a response. He then (for reasons I still don't understand) put his daughter on the phone.

She told me what had happened, and explained that she wanted her child to be buried with ""other children"" (my brother). We both shared our experiences and heartbreak. We cried on the phone together, and when she began to thank me for my understanding, I brought up that while I sympathized with her, I didn't agree with what she had done (essentially stolen from my family). 

Instantly, she was swearing at me and calling me ""heartless"" and ""a monster who wanted to dig up her baby"". After another string of insults, she informed me that she could bury her baby wherever she wanted on her ""daddy's lot"". 

After I again tried to explain to her that my parents had already purchased the plots, she quickly hung up on me.  

I understand that she's not at all in the right frame of mind to be discussing this now. Losing a child is beyond heartbreaking, and something that both of our families have experienced. I am deeply sorry for her loss, yet do not think that losing a child entitles you to anything that you may want.

Since our conversation, the owners have never responded to any of my calls or emails. 

My parents also sympathize with her, and understand her grief. They don't want to dig up her child, but rather would like some new open grave spots for my brother and them.

I'm at a loss for what to do. I'm a freshman in undergrad studying legal studies, but this event has been so bizarre and unlike anything I've ever studied for school or seen mentioned on here. Should I take action? Do I have a right to take action? Is there a way to approach this without offending anyone? 

There's a huge emotional variable that plays into this, and I'm absolutely at a loss for how to handle this situation.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7lg4us/child_buried_in_my_familys_gravesite/,legaladvice,1225,136,0.0

ThrowTheFudgeAwayPlz,2017-12-21 00:27:40+00:00,"(UT) I am renting a landlocked... Bedroom. ""neighbors"" won't let me out.","Yup. Whoever built this house was a MORON and decided it would be a fantastic idea to make it so that my room doesn't open into a hallway. I have two options. One, go through a wooden sliding door into the bathroom, or two, go into a second bedroom. I guess option three would be using my window. 

Option one isn't my favorite. The wooden sliding door doesn't have a lock on either side. Meaning if someone is taking a dump I could walk right in. It also means my room steams up, but nevermind. 99 percent of the time this isn't an issue as the door has huge gaps at all edges and I can see light/hear noises. The other 1 percent I walk right in. It's down a mini hallway in my room that's been converted into a closet so I can't always hear, and people don't always turn on the light. Bonus points, the door is right in front of the toilet. More bonus points, opening it requires both hands and means I'm usually facing the shower stall when it opens. Yeah, there's no handle. 

Option Two is what I've been doing for the last year. The people (it's large enough to comfortably have three beds in and still put in an office) who lived in the next bedroom were my friends, and were totally okay with me coming and going. They moved out, and two chicks moved in. I'm a guy. You see the issue. They have now locked the door from their side via big dresser. 

So I've been going through the bathroom. This is fine usually as they're SUPER into their looks and make tons of noise. The problem? They're SUPER into their looks and can be in there for up to two hours showering/blowdrying their hair/whatever girls do in the bathroom. This is... Not great. It's made me late for several classes, and work. They usually open the door when I knock, or will work around me to let me out if I let them know I need to leave at X time. Sometimes however they can't get out quick (middle of shampooinig their hair apparently means it takes at LEAST 20 minutes to get a robe and let me through) 

My landlord lives out of state and seems to agree with them that I have no right to enter their room. She also says to ""work it out"" with the bathroom. Like, write down my schedule and paste it on the bathroom door so they know not to use it at X time. That's great, but ruins my privacy, and also doesn't count for those last second things like finding out my friend was in an accident. I can't plan for every single unexpected incident and write it down for them to maybe see. 

So my legal question is, do I have any rights to get out of my room? I only rent the room, normal ""I printed this off the internet K"" lease which ends in October, renewed yearly. Girls are on a separate two year lease. We split utilities and both have access to the rest of the house. 

If I don't have rights to get out of my room, can I at least demand a lock? Both for my privacy and theirs. What if the steam from the shower damages my stuff? I have to keep my window open in the middle of winter to keep my electronics from getting wet. 

[Is this room even legal to rent??](https://i.imgur.com/XcERBjN.png)


Edit: So it looks like my first call is to the fire marshal tomorrow, and then code enforcement(?) to see if it was an illegal addition. If you all want I can update what if anything they find. Thanks everyone for digging through the code for me

It looks like the situation is degrading fast, so I'll probably ask the landlord about a break lease. At this point I'm just done. They're nuts.

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5g52v8/update_terminated_company_says_i_cant_sue_ny)

Everything has resolved, and I've been wanting to give yo guys an update, but had to wait until my lawyer gave me the ok to talk about things.  

So let's start from the beginning. I pulled one of my direct reports, Deborah, into another room to discuss a few mistakes she made, but did not discipline her further. After this, she went to Joyce, one of the managers above me but not in my direct line of report. Equal to my boss in terms of reporting structure.  When Joyce heard that I had taken Deborah into another room without any witnesses, she said to her that it was unprofessional.  

Apparently her exact words were, ""You know, you could accuse him of being inappropriate with you, and I would have no choice but to believe you."" This was repeated several times, with a strong emphasis on ""no choice"". Joyce then asked Deborah if I had been inappropriate with  her, saying, ""It will only happen again if you don't speak up now. If you do now, we can take action.""  

Taking the not at all subtle hint from Joyce, Deborah accused me of exposing myself to her, and I was placed on leave pending an investigation.  Joyce immediately sent out an e-mail that nobody besides the secretary was to speak with me without an attorney present, and told the IT guy, Paul, to deactivate my access.  

James, my boss, had a resume from Terri, an employee in Joyce's department, applying for my job before close of business that day, and she was hired.  

Paul and I talked, he provided me with video proving my innocence. The company continued to stonewall me, and refused to talk to me.  When they did, they attempted to push me into arbitration, and to retroactively sign an arbitration agreement.

I cut my losses, took another job, and was ready to move on. Sandy, an employee in Joyce's department, broke protocol, talked to HR at the new company, told them I had sexually assaulted a subordinate, and cost me the job.  

So that brings us up to date. My attorney and I launched a civil suit against the company and Deborah. Bet you're wondering how I know the above. Well good old Joyce said she'd protect Deborah if she came forward. Unfortunately, that only extended to her job. So when she was named individually in this suit, corporate told her they would not be providing her an attorney. After realizing that she'd be putting her house up for collateral, she was all too willing to throw Joyce under the bus.  

Joyce went to Paul, the IT guy, who was one of her reports and gave him a list of footage to be procedurally wiped as part of an archive clearout. He pointed out that the incident with me was on that list and part of an ongoing investigation.  

Joyce told him that it was no longer needed and to go ahead and wipe it. He refused citing the fact that it would still be requested in the event that the suit moved forward. She told him to pack his things as he was being terminated for insubordination.  He called the company attorney and informed her what had happened.  

The aftermath:  

Several things happened at once, so I'll try to keep them as chronological as I can.  

Deborah's attorney contacted mine stating that, conditional on me dropping the suit, she would admit that she lied and explain what went on behind the scenes.  

Dana, the company attorney, got the call from my attorney with the details from Deborah shortly after she finished talking with Paul about him being terminated for refusing to destroy evidence.  

Deborah and Joyce were terminated for cause that day.  Paul was told that his job was safe.  

My attorney received a call, and it was made clear that the company didn't want this to go any further and wanted to talk settlement.  

I won't go into all of the details, but what I can say: I was offered my job back with a very fair increase, I received back pay from the date of suspension, and a public apology was offered from the very top. Terri is now working in Joyce's old position, she's incredibly cool about things, and felt horrified when she found out what happened. James and I are good now, and he has personally apologized for not sticking up for me.  

This will likely be my final update, there is still some legal battle ongoing, but I can't go into that too much.  

Thank you for all of your support and encouragement. You guys rock! 😁",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7kmuj3/final_update_terminated_company_says_i_cant_sue_ny/,legaladvice,1198,1,0.0
iamlitgod,2017-12-18 01:57:34+00:00,"My deceased neighbors kids are trying to sell their dead dads house, but people keep driving through my parents driveway and onto our property and through our vineyards","EDIT: THIS IS IN CALIFORNIA

So about three years ago our neighbor died in a plane crash. He was a great guy, we attended his funeral and it was really heartbreaking to hear of his passing one day on the news. However, he left behind a house that was built on ""landlocked"" land. There supposedly is supposed to be an side roadway to the house from the main road on the far right side of his property, but it hasn't been used in years and would probably require an easement agreement between his other neighbors instead of us. 

Like I said, he was a great guy. One of the most genuine men my family knew, and was a very caring and loving man. So, my parents allowed an easement between his property and ours so that his property would not be landlocked. This ""easement,"" basically allowed for him to access his property by driving through our gravel road, pass the front of our house, onto his own property. This genuinely worked completely fine up UNTIL he died. To my knowledge the easement agreement says the easement is for ""services"". Now of course his shitty kids are trying to sell the house for profit, have placed the house on AirBNB, and other sites which have led to issues between them and my parents. 

Firstly, we live in the country on a ranch with vineyards we own. My mom on multiple occasions has stated that individuals renting the house through AirBNB have caused massive amounts of noise and walked around on our property and left trash and gone through our vineyards both during the day and night. I've personally heard loud noises and music and weird occurrences during renting as well. My dad also has a massive car garage detached from our house near the property line, and my mom insists she thinks people have either tried to rummage through his cars tools and work equipment or walked around on that part of the property at night.

Secondly, we have dogs. 4 to be exact. And chickens. Random cars with random people both trying to look at the house and rent it out have barreled down our gravel driveway causing dirt and rocks to fly everywhere without any respect for their use of the road and has given my mother a huge scare a couple of times that someone is going to hit one of our animals. This happens multiple times of the week, day and night.

Thirdly, random cars and random individuals have actually DRIVEN into our vineyard and on our property trying to figure out where the house is that's for sale, and onto our barn and ranch property. My parents do NOT like this for obvious reasons and neither do I. 

Fourthly, MULTIPLE individuals have stopped by OUR own house and walked around it and tried to get inside thinking that IT is the house for sale. Touching random things and trying to open doors! We have no idea what people do if no one is home but the couple of times I have experienced this and had to tell people they have the wrong house these individuals have *insisted* that this is the correct house and have tried to tell me I'm wrong. My dad had to chase one man and wife OFF our property once and get in his truck to follow them out and threaten that they are/were trespassing. 

My parents have negotiated and tried almost everything, including speaking to the kids and even considering buying the property themselves because the annoyance and disturbances of both renters and people too stupid to use google maps and read addresses correctly has become such a nuisance. The main reason they won't buy the house is because these kids are asking for WAY more than that property is worth. An absolutely ridiculous amount. We've even tried to get individuals we know that are looking to buy country houses to buy the property but the price range is just outrageous. BY THE WAY, they also tried to set up a realtor sign on OUR property which my dad promptly kicked down and threw back onto THEIR property. Since then, my dad has begun the process of welding a huge gate at the very front of our long gravel driveway.

Does anyone have any legal advice on how to proceed or what can possibly be done about the situation? The kids haven't necessarily threatened legal recourse but they mentioned it in a meeting with my parents and my dad spouted the same back. 

EDIT: well this blew up. I'll try and get my hands on deeds and surveying plots as suggested sometime today. The advice in here has been super helpful so far and I've been talking to my dad about it and asking him questions. I really want to figure this out as my parents don't have the time or resources but I do since I'm on school break and to be honest those kids behavior towards my parents and our property has been utterly disrespectful and rude and disgraceful after the kindness we had received for years from their passed father. 

EDIT: crude drawing I did under my surveyor fathers instructions. I labeled it as best as I could for those that asked! https://imgur.com/a/TrYTM

To clarify, the service easement is what my parents set up with the deceased father, however, my dad thinks the main access easement for the other four neighbors we have is also meant to run to the selling kids property, but we won't know this for sure until we pull up a bunch of deeds and documents and find it 100% in writing.

IndistinguishableSus,2017-12-17 16:28:32+00:00,UPDATE:Co-worker attempted to film female co-worker in restroom at party,"[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7jg4up/coworker_attempted_to_film_female_coworker_in/)

So it's been a few days and a lot has happened. As I said in the previous post, I called the SARC and she directed me to get in touch with NCIS. For whatever reason, they never answered their damn 'on-call duty agent phone' that day.

I had to go into work, and it was really fucking difficult working next to the guy that night. I ran through a dozen different ways to tell the right people in my head, but circumstances made me wait. About halfway through our shift I was able to tell the victim in a private setting. She was obviously very upset, then I immediately went and told our superior officer of our crew. He agreed to take care of it. I finished the shift without seeing the victim (my female co-worker) again. 

I left work and immediately drove to the NCIS office on base. The agent there was awesome. We went through all of the details and I started writing out my statement. While doing so, my officer in charge called me to get details so he could pass it up the chain. I told him that I was already at NCIS and he was pleased. He thanked me for coming forward and ensuring our co-worker would be protected. By the time I finished writing my statement, the whole command was aware of the situation. I was pleased.

I already knew that the victim was going to get a night off. What I didn't know is that the suspect (host of the party) would no longer be with us anymore as well. The official explanation was ""trouble with his security clearance."" This is speculation, but I think while investigating the camera aspect of this, they found evidence of him using illegal betting services. The government doesn't take that shit lightly, especially if you have a security clearance. I think this because the same day he wasn't at work, they warned the staff that if you use illegal betting services (a bookie), to stop.

That's it. He's under investigation and I remained anonymous. My officer knows, but I trust him. I was on the same ship with him for years. He's a great guy. Now hopefully he will never be able to hurt someone like this again. Thanks for the great advice, even though I knew generally what to do in the first place. Sometimes it's just good to get some validation on my thought process. 

**TL;DR: Host of party removed from staff duties, is under investigation. Possibly caught using a bookie and will lose security clearance.**

KayleighAnn,2017-12-17 13:54:24+00:00,"[MI] I sell handmade items on Amazon and Etsy. A website is taking my photos and descriptions and selling them as their own, I am not the only one.","EDIT: I am aware that drop-shipping is legal. They are copying my photos and descriptions. They are copying from my Amazon primarily, I am not having these same issues on my Etsy shop.

I have been selling my handmade items since 2009, and occasionally run into people on Etsy who copy my designs, but that's easily dealt with with a message. 

Now, a lot of other sellers are finding their listings on this website, which appears to be drop-shipping. They take our photos, descriptions, and mark up the price by a lot. For example, one of my ornaments that sells for $8 is marked up to $20. 

This is my only income after losing my job from a work related injury, I don't know what route to take because several sellers have already messaged the website, issued C&amp;D, and threatened legal action (though I doubt any of them can afford to follow through either). 

I don't know what route we can take, as a group or as a single person. It is hurting my business because I recently updated some photos and have gotten a few return requests since the photos they have don't represent my updated products accurately. 

EDIT 2: 
Some of this has been really helpful, since a lot of my items are Christmas items I'm going to just disable them from Amazon since the 19th is my cutoff date for Christmas delivery anyway. Other items I am going to update with new photos (including watermarks). 

I do know that drop shipping is legal. My issue is that I sell through Amazon, which does not really allow me to reject a return. The drop shipper purchases the item and has me ship it to their customer, and when the customer doesn't want it or changes their mind, the drop shipper requests a refund that I have to pay return shipping on. They are taking my photos, which is not legal. 

Finally, I am not raising my prices. I would say that at most, 20% of my recent sales are because of this drop-shipper. I am selling a lot of items on Amazon, and all of my newest listings that have been selling quickly are not listed on their site, since they haven't seen/added them to their site yet. I don't want to alienate my customers by jacking up prices, as I want them to come back for items year round and remember my brand as trustworthy.

EDIT 3: Amazon does not allow me to watermark my images. 

EDIT 4: This really got a lot more attention than I expected! I've been contacting Shopify, Amazon, Mastercard, Visa, basically anyone I can. I am working with some other Handmade on Amazon sellers, we are all contacting the site and demanding that they remove our photos, updating our listings, and making sure we include business cards, inserts, and invoices. It may cause some more returns, but the website does not make enough sales off of us to raise our prices above theirs, it would alienate our customers like I mentioned above. 

Thank you to everyone who has been encouraging and helpful, I am needing a break because they are repairing the roof on our apartment, so between this and the noise I am wanting to rip my hair out :/ Hubby has offered to take me out for some wings.

 Location: Indiana

They received a letter stating that a hog farm would be built directly next door to their property, putting them downwind of the farm.  We have read horror stories of hog farms being built and people having to move away because of the smell and run off.  Every article talked about how much property value drops once the farm is approved.  This property is her parents dream and their main life investment.  They were planning on turning it into a wedding venue at some point.  The property used to be an old camp, so there are multiple buildings and they have transformed it into something that is really beautiful and now they think that is all going to be ruined for them and they are not sure what they can do.  They have already started trying to make it an official wedding venue and starting an LLC.  We are really looking for any advice or if anyone has experienced fighting a pig farm.  The pig farm has not been built and they have 30 days of comments, but only notified people within a half mile of the proposed farm.
  
Edit/Update - Thank you for all of your comments and help. Her parents have been going door to door to handed out flyers for a ""neighborhood"" meeting.  The people trying to setup this pig farm have specifically chosen the holidays to start the questioning and notification period, so a lot of lawyers are on vacation.  The last council meeting is scheduled for when her family has planned to go on a holiday vacation.
  
Edit 2 - Again, thank you to everyone for posting comments and offering your help.  I will keep trying to reply to each question that has been asked so far.  They have a ""neighborhood"" meeting planned for today to go over everything as a group.  We have taken notes and we are still doing research, which most of new talking points are those that were posted on here. A friend is a property value lawyer and has offered to look into the issue and hopefully be able help to write any legal letter that we may need. I will try and update this post as new things develop and hopefully we will be able to deliver a positive update post in the coming weeks/months.

I am an idiot.

I intend to to move out, leave a file for my Dad with all evidence I find after I talk to him about it (as well as keep copies for myself). My fraud-accountant friend is close to a good lawyer that does stuff for people like me pro bono. I have their contact info.  

My Boss gave me keys to her house and the keys to a guest camper in case I need a place to crash. Her sister did this to her a few years ago and she is still suffering. 3 different people have offered me a place. Very glad to have amazing friends and boss. 

I am going to burn this mess and salt the earth so nothing ever grows here again. (Figuratively speaking)

Original post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7er15w/theyre_taking_my_child/). 

I haven't heard from my kid since the service for my wife. 

I spoke with my family attorney, and he said that the state of Kentucky passed laws a few years ago that essentially reinforce the concept that the step-parent has no laws, rules, policies, or anything at all in the family dynamic. So, I'm fucked. 

We've tried to be amicable to the father. I've called, texted, no answer and no response. He came by the day after the service to get her school bag, a pair of shoes, and a doll her mother got her. And since that point, no contact. I'm going to keep trying, reaching out to the various family members on his side trying to get him to even pick up the phone, let alone talk to me. 

As for the legacy of my wife, I'm taking what remains of the life insurance policy after the payout for the service, and putting it into my kid's college account. Anything left in my wife's checking account is going to a custodial account for my kid, so that when she turns 16/17 and starts looking at a car, she has a down-payment for something that's safe. 

And then we just endure.

ArtistOutlawIGuess,2017-12-11 15:46:52+00:00,Update: Art Cartel,"I posted a while ago about a business in town claiming I was running a cartel.
https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7a3xi4/apparently_im_running_an_art_cartel/


I figure I owe a follow up to all the crazy that has happened, even though most of it is social small town drama and not ""legal"".  Still, it's been an insane month.  For ease, I'm just going to refer to both people and places as Gallery A, Gallery B and Gallery C.  (Also I got a lot of guesses as to my shop and town. Also I got a lot of guesses as to where I live. At least one was correct but I'm not going to verify because I don't want John harassed.)

Coming off of the first post I made, John was continuing to make weird statements online.  I had a few people who are friends with him agreeing to take screenshots.  In one, he was petitioning for funds to bring a lawsuit against The Three Banditos.  Someone asked what his proof was that we were hurting his business, and he posted a weird combination of google pictures of our storefronts, an ad for one of our events, and a listing in an old ad for downtown businesses that was printed a year before he went into business.  He also linked to a several year old interview from Gallery A about supporting high school artists.

I had my meeting scheduled with my lawyer on Tuesday Nov 7th, but he called on Monday.  When I answered the phone he joked ""I'm really disappointed in what a terrible art cartel you're running.""  It turns out my lawyer's secretary had been at the coffee shop when John was trying to get money and kept a copy of the list of grievances.  When I arrived for the meeting on Tuesday, my lawyer had a downright sassy letter ready to go for John which told him that any future threats would be taken seriously and then helpfully referred him to the definitions of a cartel.

For a few days, nothing.  Then my lawyer, I and the other galleries all get a copy of John's list of grievances in the mail.  This was the first I read it, but essentially pinpoints me as the head of the art cartel based on the fact that I was the one to sign the contract for the advertising page we took out in the local tourist book.  He also points out we have similar hours of operation we established without consulting him.  (A note about this.  We don't have the exact hours.  We just all are open similar times to the other businesses and restaurants around us because of traffic flow).

He also claims Gallery A is committing fraud as they show original pieces but also sell framed prints of the same work at more reasonable prices.  A new addition was the commentary that I (me, personally) had conspired with an ice cream place near him and told them to reduce their hours for the winter in order to hurt his traffic.  (The fact that they always reduce hours because ice cream doesn't sell in winter apparently wasn't it). There were a few other points, but those were the most bizarre.

My lawyer CC'd me on a letter that can be summed up ""Seriously, knock it off,"" and told him he was banned from my shop.

On Veteran's day, I got a call from the high school art teacher.  She told me that John had called her and told her not to work with local galleries anymore.  He said that if she ceased working with us that he would give her brochures for ""legitimate"" art schools for her students.  When she said she planned to continue working with us, John said that she was leading her students to poor practices.  She contacted me afraid that there would be issue with her students.  I said I didn't foresee any issue, but thanked her for her information.  I said if it escalated, I'd ask her to speak to my lawyer.

A few days later, I get a screenshot of John's Facebook page that has listed ""the Three Banditos are at it again"".  It links to two upcoming events we were advertising for the holiday crowd.  It also included a fantastic photoshop collage of myself, the other gallery owners and a local jeweler, each wearing a black cowboy hat and bandana.  Later that day the jeweler called to jokingly ask me if there was an initiation process to join the Banditos.  We have no idea why he is included, he wasn't part of the promotion John linked.

I found out at this point that John previously attacked a Paint and Sip that's run by a local business on the local tourist Facebook page.  He posted a pic of one of their previous group photos with ""This is not art"" written across it. He pulled it after several people pointed out his high end gallery shouldn't feel threatened by a paint and sip.  But before he did Gallery C responded by posting Magritte's Treachery of Images, which is so funny in so many levels.

Then things escalated again.  On Nov 13th, John posted a pic on Facebook of Gallery B, which is located on a corner, with sidewalks only on one side.  He pointed out that if someone were to take the corner too quickly, they would crash into the building.  Then asked people to do the ""right thing"" and drink and drive around the block a few times.  It turns out Gallery B and John are in the same professional organization, and they look poorly on threats.  Gallery B sent screenshots as well as a copy of John's list of grievances and John was put on probation with the organization pending review.

The next morning, John is outside my shop screaming that he knows what I did and that I have spies.  He didn't enter the premises and left when I threatened to call police, but I did get video of him on my phone.  The same day he removed anyone local from his Facebook.  That afternoon, John apparently went to a local restaurant and hassled the owner for details about what we are doing to ruin his business.  The restaurant eventually threw him out, but up until then the owner hadn't heard any of this, so he called me to ask what the heck this was about.

Nov 16th, I was opening shop when a friend sends me a picture of John in handcuffs.  We rent advertising space at a historic site where local information is kept.  John was found vandalizing our poster, its frame, and the acrylic cover.  He did this during the day when employees were around, no clue how he thought he would get away with it.  He got a fine for his troubles, but it got more gossip out there.  Turns out I wasn't the first threatened with lawsuits in the community.  I passed this onto my lawyer.

The weekend before Thanksgiving, there was a meeting of the group that handles the downtown events, projects etc.  Most shops are fairly active with the group and the meetings are open to the public.  As far as I know John has never attended a meeting until this one.  They were discussing the finalization of Christmas tree lighting and Christmas events when a John asked for time to speak.  He handed out this paper to everyone present which had a summary of his financials at his old, city gallery and a summary of his financials at his new gallery.  Then he apparently said ""I think we all know whose fault it is that theres a difference.  I'm not naming names.""  Then he glared at everyone until they got him to leave the podium.

I was given a copy of this by someone who attended the meeting.  John isn't doing well financially. I turned it over to my lawyer.

The day before Thanksgiving there was a notice posted on the community bulletin board.  It stated that there is a conspiracy in town to put new businesses down.  It then refers to ""certain individuals"" and ""certain unnamed shops"", and has several of the same bullet points as John's list of grievances.  It also says those certain individuals have paid off all local lawyers from representing the person who put up the poster.  This notice was removed from the bulletin board as everything posted there needs prior approval.  Gallery C happened to hear about it and fished it out of the trash.  We turned it over to my lawyer.

I had hoped things would de escalate now that I was downgraded from Bandito to the Nameless One, but no such luck.  That Saturday, the 25th, we hosted an event with refreshments.  The way this works is that we sell admission and you get a wristband and go from participating shops and galleries for food.  John did not participate, as usual.

At some point during the afternoon, two of the participants went into John's shop.  When he saw the wristbands, he went into the back and came out with a scissors.  He told them to be in his gallery, they had to cut the wristbands off.  When they refused, he grabbed at the woman's hand still holding the scissors, and was yelling.  The two left the gallery and reported it to a police officer.  Their next stop was Gallery B, where they told this story.  My lawyer has been unable to get verification for this incident from police.  (This is also, as far as I know, the last time the gallery was open.)

The next day, Sunday, I got a visitor in my shop who was acting weird.  He was asking my employee detailed questions about the business:  where did we get our artwork, what did we pay, how much was rent.  When I overheard this I came over and realized the guy bore a striking resemblance to John, only younger.  Let's call him John Jr.  I introduced myself and he asked me if I had any upcoming promotions.  In response, I handed him a copy of the monthly booklet the town puts out, which has basically everything happening in the area, including our events.  John Jr looked surprised, and asked me where else he could get this booklet.  I gave him a list of places offhand.  He then asked me if everywhere got the same copy.  I said they did and it was also available online.  I was really hestitant that I was giving John information , but figured by only giving easily found public info, I was ok.

John Jr left, but I found out he went to a coffee shop and asked if they had a copy of the booklet and asked a ton of questions about it and my shop.

Gallery C contacted me last Monday to let me know that John had gotten into a heated argument with a man matching John Jr's description on the sidewalk near Gallery C.  John Jr had left and driven away.

By last Wednesday, John had a sign on the door of his gallery stating it would be closed any day there is a planned downtown event listed online.  As there's something happening nearly every day for the holidays, this would mean he will be closed essentially all of December.

The next day, Gallery C got a letter from John.  It told him to stop walking by the front of John's store, and claims to have ""hours of footage"" of him passing by.  He then threatened to sue Gallery C for using the public sidewalk. (Gallery C and John are on the same street and Gallery C needs to use the parking lot past John's store, so he does pass by twice a day.). At this point, Gallery C decided to retain my lawyer.  He was told to cross the street instead of passing directly in front of John's gallery for the time being, but our lawyer also sent a response letter.  Gallery C informed me of this after their meeting.

At this point, I also found out through the grape vine that John had attempted to hire my lawyer some weeks prior in order to sue me, only to be told it would be a conflict of interest.

John responded by sending our lawyer a rambling, multi page letter that had some elements of his list of grievances and other additions.  While it probably was in response to Gallery C, most of it was directed at me, so my lawyer showed it to me.  it was mostly insulting my business and saying I purposefully am putting him out of business.  It also includes that John attempted to get this put in the local newspaper some weeks prior, but they turned him down.  We are trying to get verification of this.  My lawyer basically says if John does anything else, he is bringing the hammer down on him, and sent a letter to this effect.

At dinner, I heard a rumor John is behind on his rent and the landlord is planning evictions after the holidays.  Because his gallery has been closed, I haven't seen John since Thanksgiving weekend.

Gallery B sent a Christmas card with a cropped pic of himself in a black hat and bandana from John's Facebook, framed in a wreath.  He wants us to take a group photo in black cowboy hats and bandanas for next year's local business review.  I'm debating it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7j2zfu/update_art_cartel/,legaladvice,5227,2,0.0
DrF4rtB4rf,2017-12-11 04:57:11+00:00,My GF got abducted at a bar while I was being physically restrained from stopping it. The bar staff was in on it. The cops wont do anything. I don't know what options I have.,"So Friday night my girlfriend and I are at the bar we frequent a lot. We go there and get drinks at least one night a week sometimes more. We live a block away, maybe a two-minute walk from the door of the bar to our porch. The door guys all know us, they know that we’re together, we come in together, we drink together, we never get too intoxicated, we’ve never caused any trouble or drama. I would say we are model patrons, we drink light and tip extremely well (she and have been bartenders for a long time, we know how to conduct ourselves). 

Friday, my GF gets a little too drunk as she had been drinking with some friends who were celebrating a birthday. No big deal, it happens. I was relatively sober, I had had maybe 3 red stripes. Its about 1:15am, I tells my friends I have to take my GF home. After saying goodbye to the friends I find my GF talking to an unfamiliar woman. Neither my GF or I have ever seen or met her before. She very rudely tells me that I can’t interrupt their conversation. Ok, whatever. I politely stand about 15 feet away and wait for whatever their talking about to finish. I assumed the woman was bumming a cig. I see my GF is wobbling, having difficulty standing. I go over again, this time I’m a more urgent. “hey I really have to take her home now”. the woman says “she’s not going home with you”

What? I thought maybe this woman thought I was an unfamiliar creep. “Um yes she is. She’s my girlfriend, I’ve known her since we were in kindergarten together. we’ve been best friends for 20 years.” That’s when some guy grabs me and pulls me away from the woman and my GF, physically restraining me from them. They then go out the back door, and I follow but again some guy physically restrains me and refuses to let me talk to my GF. At this point I ask the door guy for assistance because he knows us as regulars, and his response is to let my GF, the woman, and the guy back into the bar and bars the doorway, saying I’ve been 86ed. He tells his door guy buddies not to let me in as well. 

Now I’m starting to panic because this is incredibly creepy behavior. There is no reason this should be happening. I walk around to the front and the door guys in the front are waiting for me. I don’t even try to get back in, instead I find a couple of police officers a few doorways down. I tell them I feel that my GF is getting abducted. The ask where. I say in the bar. They say “nah, I don’t think so” and shoo me away. I go back to the front of the bar and wait. About after about 5-10 minutes woman and man come out, leading my Stumbling GF. I immediately go to talk to her, but before I am even 5 feet away the door guy comes out onto the sidewalk and grabs me. Physically restrains me, rips my shirt. While I’m getting restrained girl and guy put my GF into an uber. It was very clear that they had told the doorguy and he was complicit in their plans. Going from the bar into the uber and dodging me was all orchestrated. While the uber is waiting in traffic, I find a new cop, not the one I talked to before. I tell him what’s happening in a panic, so I admit I probably looked and sounded like a drunken crazy person. He doesn’t believe me but he checks anyway. goes over and sticks his head in the uber for about 10 seconds and comes back. “no one was getting abducted in there” I say it’s because she’s shitfaced drunk. He says it all looked fine to him. I say “are you prepared to say you did everything to prevent her from getting raped?”, he responds with “do you want to go to jail?” I turn on my heel and walk away. The last thing I wanted as to get arrested for drunk and disorderly

I spend the entire night calling her and stressing. She doesn’t answer her phone. She comes home at around 9am the next morning. she has no memory of last night. Doesn’t remember the people, doesn’t remember leaving the bar, doesn’t have a clue where they took her. she had to take an uber home. Says they were “nice people” and refuses to make a report, because they “meant well”. she didn’t see me get restrained and thought that I had left her. I think they probably told her that I left her. she is completely on my side that no one should have treated me like that and says she would never had gone home with them if I had been there. she just thought they were nice people helping her out. She didn’t know they were not taking her home. 

I am furious. I am shaking I am so mad. I have no Idea what to think. I eventually said fuck it and called the police today myself. The officer I talked to said bluntly that no crime took place and the department will not make a report. I feel completely violated and assaulted. I am beyond angry. The man and woman who took her did it maliciously and should be arrested. The doorguys who knows me and my GF should never have let unknown people take her when she lives a block away. Everything about this is fucked up. Thank god she wasn’t harmed. 

The only thing I know about the man and woman is the address my GF took an uber from to get home. I don’t know what to do. I want justice. The cops won’t do anything but this is fucked up. The officer I talked to said the doorguys were completely righteous in their actions because they can claim they thought I was trying to harm her. At the very least I want my shirt paid for. It was an incredibly rare vintage button down. What options do I have to bring justice to the abductors and the bar staff who assaulted me and took my GF?

TL/DR: my GF got too drunk and some people physically restrained me while they abducted her. the cops claim that no crime happened ad will not take a report. I don’t know what legal recourse I have, but feel they should not be allowed to get away with it.

Edit: Also a friend of mine who was at the bar says the guy who was involved in taking her is a math professor at the university. I don't know if that matters, but with all the sexual assault training and classes we take as students, and how serious sexual assault is, I feel that the university wouldn't be too happy about one of their professors being engaged in inappropriate behavior like that. If there is a way to report him, I want him to get into a lot of trouble over this. 

Edit 2: to clarify the entire exchange between myself and the unknown woman happened at the back door of the bar, which at the time was empty except for the woman, my GF, me and the doorguy who's only job is to sit at the back door. no one else was there, my friends were inside on the other side of the bar. The door guy was very much aware that me and my gf had not been fighting, or were having trouble. like i said we are model partons of the bar and we are always very well behaved. as far as i know not a single other customer was witness to what happened at the back door. and of course i got kicked out so its not like i could go back in. 
My GF was incredibly freaked out over waking up in a strange place. she had no clue what happened, she doesn't remember the night, all she remembers is that the were nice to her in the morning. she was still heavely intoxicated when she arrived home and doesn't remember it well. She is very distraught over this entire event and horrified that i was put in that situation. it has been traumatic for her to say the least. she's just an incredibly loving person who thinks the best of people even if she may be wrong.

Edit 3: also While I had never seen the woman before I had met the man earlier in the night. we was the guy making the rounds on all the women and striking out one-by-one. thats how i know he's a university prof. he was attempting to hit on my female friends earlier in the night. I don't know how the women and man were connected, maybe they knew each other or maybe he saw the initial exchange go down between me and woman and thought he'd be win some points by helping out a damsel in distress. GF doesn't know who's house it was, his or hers. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7izxxl/my_gf_got_abducted_at_a_bar_while_i_was_being/,legaladvice,1336,369,0.0

How do I go about reporting it now?,"https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7btzy4/i_27m_was_raped_in_san_francisco_this_summer_and

I called the SF police, they set up a Skype interview with a detective. Making the report took well over two hours. It was tough. But doing it at all felt like a personal victory. 

A few weeks later the detective emailed me to say that, unfortunately, the club's cameras were not helpful. They did catch something on a nearby apartment complex's front door camera though. The footage is too grainy to make much use of, but they were able to see his approximate height and build. If someone is caught doing something similar nearby with a similar build, they *might* be able to get him to confess to it.

Not very high hopes, but it's something. At least I can say that I tried. 

Thanks for all your advice. I was lost and you helped me find the way. It's much appreciated.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7ipv5w/update_i_27m_was_raped_in_san_francisco_this/,legaladvice,5007,2,0.0
NoTansForYou,2017-12-08 01:37:38+00:00,[UPDATE] good news about my competitors fiancee trying to set us up!,"https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7ghyp4/being_threatened_with_a_lawsuit_and_being/
^Link to the previous post

 First and foremost I want to say thank you to everyone who responded to me with all of the advice. And I want to apologize if I offended anyone since I didn't do my due diligence in finding out if this was truly illegal or not. I should have made an effort to double check this instead of assuming what my past bosses/work experience said. I fucked up, I admit it and I am very sorry. I now have an updated waiver which includes pregnancy which my lawyer helped me with.

 Now for the juicy part you are all waiting for! The woman and her fiancee appear to be in some deep shit after I posted everything I had. Quite a few people had no idea she worked at a tanning salon herself, let alone she was  marrying my direct competitor. Public opinion has turned on them big time and both of them have disabled their FB's as of today although their store page is still up. I even got a nice phone call from them screaming at me and threatening to sue me for harassment which I just hung up on after telling him to sue me. Fuck them, I welcome them to sue me and have to admit their own actions are the cause of this. 


 Also some people were misunderstanding when I was referencing Acutane. I know that it's highly unlikely for a mid 20's pregnant woman to be taking it. The only reason I brought it up was it was the first thing on the top of my head that causes you to have an increased chance of burning. There are a number of OTC medicines that can cause this issue. It's the reason why I have a specific spot on my waiver about using your judgement while tanning on any medicine and a list of specific meds/antibiotics that have known reactions on the wall of each room. 

  Finally, Facebook and Google have been absolute bros with helping me out with removing the false bad reviews. Yelp on the other hand is a different story and we are looking into what we can do. They have basically told me that unless I pay to advertise with them(again) I can expect absolutely no help at all. They have also hidden all of my good reviews, new and old, all you see are the negative 1 star reviews. NEVER do business with Yelp no matter how much it seems good.

A teacher from the school we all go to commented that ""Don't bother with that loser, it's not a coincidence that Asians like him have a small penis.""

Then there are several other comments from other people mocking my friend and his supposed small penis due to being Asian. The Facebook post was only shared with some people, the poster says in a comment that ""it's safe, nobody we don't want can see any of this"" but he was wrong, because I could see it and I'm not even in that friend group.

I have confirmed that the profile was indeed the actual profile of the teacher, not a fake profile that other students made. I already have screenshots and printouts.

I'm sure being racist is unacceptable for a teacher, so is calling students names and commenting on their genitals. Who is the best person to go to with all of this? I want to make sure that the teacher gets consequences for this AND I want to make sure there's no retaliation by the school staff against me or my friend who was the target of the abuse.

scagatha,2017-12-05 03:12:41+00:00,"[CA] Police searched and trashed my house in the middle of the night, detained myself and my roommates and we were never shown a warrant. We were cleared of any wrongdoing. Do we have any recourse?","This happened about a week before thanksgiving. 

I woke up in the middle of the night to banging on the front door and yelling ""this is the police from (city 30 minutes away), open the door, we have a warrant to search your house"". I go to the door and open it, and a flashlight is shone in my face and I am told to come outside. I am immediately grabbed and handcuffed and the sweatshirt I was holding to cover my chest is thrown to the ground and I am made to sit on a wet curb (it had been raining) in only my thin pajamas in 40 degree weather. 

They proceed to do the same to my two roommates and ransack our house. They do not tell us what is going on for the entire 40-ish minutes they are searching. I am shaking head to toe from exposure to the wet cold and my roommate asks about covering me with something. The cop watching us says she will ask about it when they come out. 

They come out and finally they tell us they are looking for a ""red toolbox containing a laptop and a power drill"" that was stolen from one of their cars. They say GPS tracking is leading it to a closet in our house. They are questioning us as if we are criminals and we know what they are talking about when we are clueless. 

Finally one of them has the brilliant idea to look in the trash bins outside our house and they find what they are looking for (along with my cat litter box waste, hah). Someone had dumped the stolen goods in there and we were obviously innocent. Finally they release us and say ""thank you for your cooperation"". 

Our house was completely trashed, especially my bedroom. I was humiliated in front of my neighbors, exposed to the wet cold wearing only a thin layer of fabric and could've gotten sick. We were treated like criminals and they never even showed me a warrant! What judge would sign a warrant in the middle of the night for a damn laptop and power drill?

pwnie123,2017-12-03 14:11:26+00:00,I sued Equifax and won. They filed an appeal. What's next?,"I'm in California and I sued Equifax via small claims court and got my judgement at end of October.  From what I've read, Equifax has 30 days before I can start collecting.

However, a couple weeks ago they've served me an appeal but the service paper does not have a new court date.  The service paper said to not contact the small claims court and the court will contact me.  How long do I wait?

Update:
- I checked my case status and got this
https://imgur.com/a/Ve7m4

Does this mean the court rejected the appeal?  Oh nevermind, Equifax probably just didn't pay for their appeal.  But does that mean they didn't file within 30 days so they're SOL?

Judgement was on 10/25 so did Equifax screwed up?

https://imgur.com/a/wU0eh

Update for new comers:

- Judgement is $360 + court fees on 10/25.

- Equifax served me Appeal on 11/8 via USPS.

- Clerk sent rejection letter for non payment of filing fees on 11/15

- It's been more than 30 days, time to collect?!?!

- The main basis of my case was that I should be able to choose my own credit monitoring service rather than use a service that's ran by Equifax, the company who lost my data in the first place.  The service offered by Equifax does not fully cover all credit bureaus in the US. They admit it as well and it's on their service description.

- Sounds to me like this won't fly as well in Civil court so I will probably try to find a legal angle to this.

- Obviously if I do come up with any argument I may not post it here since Equifax may be reading, sorry guys.  I'm only disclosing what I've already disclosed prior to today.

- Step by step process will be reserved for when I do get to collection to not encourage others to follow suit.  While I welcome what's to come, it may not be in your best interest and like others have said, even I might be in over my head.  Oh well.

- Worse case scenario, I lose $150 to Equifax for court fees due to:
&gt; Code of Civil Procedure sections 116.780 and 116.790. Section 116.780(c) provides that the court may award the winning party attorney’s fees actually and reasonably incurred in connection with the appeal, but not exceeding $150 (as well as lost earnings and transportation/lodging expenses not exceeding an additional $150). Section 116.790 allows the court, if it finds the appeal “was without substantial merit and not based on good faith, but was intended to harass or delay the other party, or to encourage the other party to abandon the claim,” discretion to award the other party actual, reasonable fees that do not exceed $1,000 (as well as an additional $1,000 in lost earning and transportation/lodging expenses).",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7h9tn2/i_sued_equifax_and_won_they_filed_an_appeal_whats/,legaladvice,3642,313,0.0

throwaway50847,2017-11-30 18:06:20+00:00,[NE] HOA towed away my car and built a chainlink fence on my land,"So this is part 3 and most likely the final update for now.

Link to past: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7cirxu/continued_ne_sold_land_around_my_house_to_a/


So I was away for the holidays and I came back on Monday to find my project car was towed out of my driveway, my pond was emptied out and filled with gravel and sand and a fenced off 2 acres (2 chains by one furlong) of my property closest to HOA. I immediately called the police and filed a report regarding the stolen property. The car wasn't registered and was just an empty shell so I have no idea where it is nor will it be easy to track. It's not worth a lot (maybe $2,500?) but it's the principle of that jackass president of the HOA.


I had my lawyer draft up the C&amp;D and sent it nearly 2 weeks ago and they haven't contacted me in any way except this. I hired a local salvage company to come tear up the fence this weekend and they are doing it free of charge since I'm letting them keep the fence to sell as scrap metal or whatever they do with it. 

My lawyer suggested I send up a letter demanding payment to fix my pond as it was filled in with gravel and sand. A local landscape company quoted me nearly $8,000 to get the pond back to the way it was so that is what he suggested I ask and another $2,000 for loss of use of the pond. The HOA has lawyered up so I think it's best I no longer post anything else on here until it's settled. I didn't want to leave you all without some closure since you all have been an amazing help. I've put a picture of the layout since a few people asked. It's bad but should convey the land.

My hair is currently dark purple, but in my license picture it's black, it looks almost exactly the same in a dimly lit bar anyway! So I tell the bartender I have a passport and he is confiscating my real ID and he says he will believe me when I bring my passport. 

I retrieve my passport, which clearly shows my age, and this time I ask to speak to the manager.

He went on a rant about how I tried so hard to act ""of age"" and had all this fake proof and a fake life. By this point the venue is almost empty and the bouncers kick us out.

It was without heartbreak, like me she was disowned by my father. He is stubborn and set in his ways, he won't change. 

Edit:

Wow another overwhelming response to our plight, I'll try to answer any questions in between shifts today.


First. My father isn't an evil hateful man. There is no threat to our physical safety, we hope with time and as progressive liberal values breach religious ideology we will amend our relationship.


Second point on arraigned marriages, my families standing ensured that our agreed suitors were of similar means; our rejection and flight hurt his standing. I know this concept is foreign to my American friends, but our marriages were very much a singular point in a greater interwoven network of dealings. I'M NOT JUSTIFYING the practice, its abhorrent; but its a custom in a large part if the world today.

We both gave up ""wealth"" for individual freedoms. While our risk was low due to our family standing, relocating to a country with tighter controls on freedoms made the potential for exploitation a real possibility. The real tragedy is women of low standing forced into marriages that are one sided, that's the tale of caution told to me, I shared with you.

I noticed it while it was happening so I went up to the tow truck driver to try to get him to stop. If I'm not mistaken CA law states that if a tow truck is still on private property then one can insist that they drop it. (AB 2210) I got in between him and the car and he punched me in the face and groin. He then called the police, who arrived and charged us both with misdemeanor battery. He then towed my car. 

The car is under my mom's name. The tow truck company is insisting that she must be the person to retrieve it, despite me having a notarized letter granting me permission as agent of the owner to retrieve the car. But she's located hundreds of miles away.. 

The tow truck company also is trying to charge me for the time the tow truck driver spent talking to police. It's been in the lot for 2 days so far. They want to charge me $820. 

My neighbors have also had run-ins with the same driver. He grabbed a woman earlier last year and dragged her out of her car. Also I found a neighbor who witnessed me being struck repeatedly.

kentuckyfriedcheese,2017-11-25 16:26:53+00:00,"Older woman made a large donation to our group, turns out she used a stolen card. We can't easily refund the donation. IA.","My son is a high school student and part of a school-sponsored club. Recently his club decided to do a toy drive for a local organization (same idea as toys for tots) for the holidays, and set up at a nearby store that let them have a booth out front. When people entered the store they asked them to consider buying a toy to drop back off on their way out of the store.

A woman who was maybe 55 or 60 made an extremely generous donation of two carts full of gifts. She told the kids to work hard and get good jobs but don't forget that money isn't worth anything in Heaven, so don't let money run their lives otherwise they'd end up an old lady with lots of money and no family to spend it on. She had a gift receipt for the products and had spent over $3000, having purchased a number of big ticket items. This is obviously extremely, extremely generous. However, considering that she had a valid receipt and a Walmart employee was helping her push the second cart, and the little speech she had given about having a lot of money and no one to spend it on, we saw nothing obviously wrong with the transaction, just a heartwarming gesture from a kind person.

Yesterday for Black Friday the kids took the donations to the location of the local organization, where they wrapped gifts and the gifts were mixed into all the other donations the group has received. So, we can't easily take the bunch of toys back to Walmart and get the money back.

This morning we have learned that this woman was mentally ill. She had used her daughter's credit card for the purchase. The daughter was able to figure out enough to get in touch with the school about the situation.

The school is saying that since the kids did this with good intentions as part of a school club, administrators are looking into the incident directly. They were clear in that they don't consider the kids to have done anything wrong, but are notifying me because my son organized the event and it was publicized a bit with his name, so in the event that we are contacted directly they don't want us to be blindsided. I spoke with an administrator on the phone this morning who said that a police report has been filed.

I'm wondering if there is anything we should be doing specific to our son's involvement, or just sit tight. Thank you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7fg6xf/older_woman_made_a_large_donation_to_our_group/,legaladvice,1925,258,0.0
Plantalones,2017-11-24 09:14:13+00:00,I’ve have had the cops called on me 3x by my downstairs neighbor and I don’t know what to do.,"I live in a busy city and surprisingly I am fed up with my downstairs neighbor. My gf and I moved into a new apartment last May and have gotten complaint after complaint from our downstairs neighbor. It began as angry notes pinned to our mailbox which, at first we felt ashamed for walking too loudly, but after the 5th message when were were at home doing nothing besides watching TV and going to bed at 10-11pm we realized our neighbor might be crazy.  We notified the property manager and he said he would tell her no more notes. We were good for a bit, but then she started calling the cops directly. 

Now I am writing this after being woken up in the middle of the night for the third night in two weeks from a violent knock on the door from the city police telling me that a noise complaint was being phoned in from my downstairs neighbor. The police felt as embarrassed as I did when I opened the door in my boxers with them asking  me if I was  having a party. I have no idea what to do legally and what rights I have, but this seems like harassment to me. There is nothing scarier than being woken up in the middle of the night by policemen at your door knocking like it’s a big drug raid or something when you are fast asleep. I know laws in California tend to favor the bottom tenant but this seems completely unreasonable.

 Anyways the times we have talked to our downstairs neighbor she has yelled at us and told us we are not “being like adults” and “stepping too loudly”, but we are simply living in our apartment. We both work relatively late, but take our shoes off when we are at home and are careful not to run the dishwasher at night (after an angry note telling us not to do so). A big part of me wants to knock on her door, stomp on the floor and wake her up in the middle of the night too, but I don’t want to start an even bigger battle.  I have no idea what to do or legally what I can do. File a harassment suit? Complain once again to our property manager?

The cops told me to talk to the landlord which I did, but I just got woken up again tonight so I guess that didn’t work out too well. My gf is fed up, as am I after tonight, but not sure what steps to take next. I live in San Francisco/CA which I know has all sorts of tenant-landlord laws so I feel completely helpless here. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.   I can post images of the notes if needed.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7f6by7/ive_have_had_the_cops_called_on_me_3x_by_my/,legaladvice,2576,256,0.0

&amp;nbsp;

We've gotten some renewed interest around the fight to preserve net neutrality within the United States, so I annoyed enough /u/zanctmao until they agreed to get sticky with me. 

 
&amp;nbsp;


First off, what is net neutrality, you might ask? Essentially, net neutrality is the status quo. It requires ISPs to treat all packets equally. The information from your 2003 Geocities page is just as important as the latest Youtube sensation. For a more detailed explanation that doesn't involve lame throwbacks, see the wikipedia page below.
 
&amp;nbsp;

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_neutrality

 
&amp;nbsp;


Now, what can the average citizen do to help fight for net neutrality? If you're like me, you don't have the funds to hire a high-powered team of attorney's to fight Comcast, AT&amp;T, and their *ilk*. But you can complain! Complaining is free. Here's an oldy but goody Reddit post on how to get a hold of the FCC and tell them you don't like what they are doing.

We did talk to another lawyer about suing for the cost of the vet bills. They are more then what is allowed in small claims court so we would definitely need a lawyer. She said we may have a chance if my daughter could speak in court about what she saw and heard. We took my daughter to the court house and into a court room to explain to her what shed need to do and it is not going to happen. She was scared and had a meltdown and that was an empty room with her therapist beside us. There is no way she could do that so we are done. She's been traumatized enough. 

My daughter still cries most if the time and only goes to school about twice a week now. It has been absolute hell and I am extremely frustrated with the ""system"" even if I understand why it's this way. As far as my neighbor he's still an asshole. He threw fire crackers over our fence in the middle if the night but because we didn't see him do it the cops couldn't do anything. He was sitting on his porch when the cops came though. 

We've spoken with other neighbors about it and it seems he's not well like but some just want to ignore it, which I understand. One awesome neighbor works for a security company and brought us security cameras and installed them all at no cost to me! He told his work about our story and they donated them. We've had them about a week and have had no issues yet. We still haven't had luck in finding another puppy to train. We've reached out to everyone we can think of and either they still want more than we can afford or they can't help at all. I won't give up though. My daughter needs this more now than ever. Our vet is also going to donate the first 2 years if normal vet care for our puppy when we get one!

Farertion,2017-11-17 19:23:55+00:00,Public North Carolina High School. Says my son's hairstyle and color violates school's social norms. (Update: Found a way around it),"https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/789wcm/public_north_carolina_high_school_says_my_sons/

I want to you all for the help and advice that you gave us. I realized that this, while stupid, is probably within the rights of the school. But that didn't mean there was nothing we could do. A lot of you brought up the idea of a using a wig. Sadly, wigs also weren't allowed except for ""legitimate religious, cultural or medical reasons with prior approval.""

However, what did surprise me was that there were two girls who were on a green dye for months without a problem. This definitely sounded like gender discrimination. Allowing that dye for girls and not boys. So I went in there to speak with the principal again, I told him that I'm recording the conversation and after speaking about wigs, told him that they're allowing girls to do that but not boys. Principal said this is a matter of judgement because unnatural hair colors doesn't diminish the feminine attributes of women, but unnatural hair colors for men does diminish their masculine attributes. I got it then, that nonsense is all this has been about. They think a long and blue hair on a boy isn't manly enough.

I reminded him that this is gender discrimination and gender is a protected class. He remained silent for more than a minute, I expected him to say it's fine and they'll backtrack but I was shocked when he told me that I'm right, they'll reinforce this requirement for girls too. ""It's best to get rid of these unnatural colors from our school.""

I hate what I did. The last thing I wanted was to cause trouble for those girls or start a chain of actions that could have ended up with them being forced to change their favorite hairstyles. They were contacted too, and were given the same choice.

Two days later my son came to me and said he's spoken with the girls and they have a solution. They want to dye their hair a very white silverish color. It's naturally occurring because you get it when you get old, and some people are born with it as well. I know the more mature thing would have been to tell him to end this game, but I was a teenager once as well and I was even more stubbern than he is now. So I allowed it.

The school didn't like it. The three of them were called to the principal's office where they argued their case that their hair color is naturally occurring now. They said it's the same color as one of the teachers who is quite old, ""are you gonna suspend Mr. X as well over his hair color?""

The principal laughed at them and backed off. It's been a couple of weeks since then and there hasn't been any issues. And this new color looks good on my son.

So long story short... my neighbor sued me for $10,000 in damages. I also countersued and wanted my neighbor to reimburse me for any court paperwork that I had to do, the fountain he broke, and the time I wasted.

The judge concluded that I was not responsible for injuring my neighbor's kid and that the fountain was properly secured to the best of my ability. I also showed him the video of the kid playing on top of the fountain before it fell. Judge told the parents that ultimately it was their responsibility to look after their kid especially when the video showed over 3 minutes of the kid playing on top of the fountain before the collapse. 
They knew their kids were playing on the fountain and they did not tell them to stop.

Judge rewarded my request for the damages to my fountain. Now my neighbors are hating on me. Just weeks ago, my house was egged on Halloween, away from the view of the camera and I was the only house that was egged! Very suspicious that I would be the one house that was egged and know the position of the camera unless I have shown it to them... like in court. Are there anyways to protect myself?

Not a single guest received the full menu that we paid for. We paid over $13,000 for two meats and three sides for every single guest (165). Everyone was missing at least one of the meats and one or two sides. One of the sides was not even the correct food. 

The worst part is some did not get fed at all. It wasn’t a buffet- guests were served at their table. The food ran out so some guests were splitting plates and some went hungry. Some said by the time the food got to them it was hardly scraps. The most troubling report I’ve heard from several guests is that while walking around waiting to be served they saw the staff eating the wedding food!! Before all the guests could even eat!

My parents and I have reached out to multiple people from the venue, and are either being ignored or told they’ll get back to us later. We have a contract with them and an invoice that outlines everything we were supposed to receive. Would it be a legal nightmare to try and get some of this money back? I know it’s outside of the realm of small claims, so I’m completely lost on where to go from here.

throwaway50847,2017-11-12 22:46:56+00:00,Continued: [NE] Sold land around my house to a developer years ago; HOA formed and being forced to join it and liens on my property,"Original Post: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7bil4z/ne_sold_land_around_my_house_to_a_developer_years/

So I met with a real estate attorney that was refereed to me by a Redditor on here and did the title search and I'm in the process of trying to find the old developers' master plans.
So far here's what's been dug up.

I sold my land to Developer A. He owned the land for about 2 years and then filed bankruptcy and lost the land to the bank. That's when the maintenance of the land went to shit and I was mowing it and taking care of it, cause the bank didn't care. Bank sold it to Developer B and that is the person that built the current neighborhood. We got in touch with Developer B and he said he was no longer part of the neighborhood and in fact, the HOA is in charge of the entire area. His company just owned the lots and they sold/built on them for the families and they have 0 say anymore. I asked him about the master plans and if he thought he owned my remaining 10 acres, and he said absolutely not. The entire neighborhood sits on old land + the 20 acres that were purchased from in. So he was helpful and it was clear he had no wrongdoing.

I spoke to the lawyer to see if we could file and adverse possession on the land I maintained but he said it would be a waste of time and money, but I was just going to do it to spite the HOA. The title search and everything came up clean. It showed my parents as the previous owners and then me. So no way could they have owned my land. The records go way back, and there is a clear chain of ownership as my lawyer put it and it's incontestable.

We sent a HOA a cease and desist letter as well to stop contacting me unless they have actual signed documents that show I was part of a HOA. They never got back to me. I was out of town on came back last night to my mailbox missing. It was cut clear off the post with a chainsaw (wooden post with a metal mailbox on top). I told my lawyer this and he says that it is a big deal and that USPS would send the person to jail? I repurchased an identical mailbox and set up cameras all over the property. If they try it again, I'll have them on tape.

But the biggest thing we uncovered was that we found out what they are planning. Turns out that the HOA wants to put in ANOTHER community playground and a pool/clubhouse and they need land! They can't expand in any other direction since they're almost on the end of a highway on 1 side and the other sides are zoned for agriculture, they decided they'd try to take over my land. They have yet to also file a lien on my property so I'm guessing they were trying to force me into the HOA to make them sell my land below market value?

Either way, they showed their hand and now I'm on alert. We filed a complaint with the police regarding the stolen mailbox and we have a paper trail for that now. It's just a waiting game to see what they do next I guess.
Should I send them a letter saying I know their plan and there is no way they can get my land? They have their monthly meeting every 2nd tuesday of the month, so it's in a few days and I'm sure I'll be the topic of discussion. Should I go to it?",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7cirxu/continued_ne_sold_land_around_my_house_to_a/,legaladvice,1013,321,0.0

After reviewing the custody agreement with a lawyer we found out that the agreement about written permission from my wife for out of state travel was only until my daughter she was 16. I had completely forgotten about this and always assumed it was until 18. So this was a lot easier than I expected.

We went to California for a couple of days to both see some extended family members and she had the abortion there. My ex is very upset and furious at me but she can be as upset as she wants, she decided to punish my daughter for what happened by isolating her from her friends.

nalimokmok,2017-11-10 09:09:47+00:00,I [17M] got into a fight with my mother yesterday. This resulted in her transferring 1200$ from my account to her own as “punishment”. HELP!,"So, basically title. But first, a little background. 

I live in Sweden with my mother (I’m an only child) and attend my last year of our version of High-School. I’m 17. In Sweden we students receive 105$ from the government every month for attending school, and since I’m under 18 that money is sent to my mother’s bank account, and then immediately transferred to mine. I had managed to save about 700$ of my CSN up until now. Moreover, this summer I had worked for almost a month and earned 700$ there as well - this means my bank account contained around 1400$ until yesterday.

My mother is abusive. I recently started opening up to people about the shit she has put me through, and I’ve also started standing up to her. Yesterday... well, I forgot what we were fighting about from the start. Anyhow, she chased me around the house with a knife/a pair of scissors. She said “even if I kill you I won’t go to jail, it’s your fault I’m doing this anyway”. I’m going to be honest, I was afraid for my life.

Afterwards, she called me basically every name on this earth. She said that I owe her my life, basically. For example, I said I’d contribute money for our trip to Croatia that we took in August, but she promptly refused then. Now she says I owe her money for said trip. She said I owe her money for my phone, my video games, my clothes, my headphones etc. Then she said she’s find some rich men so she could sell me to them, so that I’d earn her money back quicker. “All in all, you owe me a few million bucks. Get working now. Actually, I think being a prostitute would suit you well, if you weren’t such a fatso, of course”, were her last words to me yesterday.

In the end, she took all my money and transferred it to her own account. Since I’m under 18 my mother does indeed control everything on my bank-account; she can check what my expenses are, when I spent money, and she can also freely transfer money to and from it. I told her she can’t take money that’s rightfully mine, that I worked for and that the government gave me. Her response? “Sue me, bitch”. 

So, here I am now. With only 120$ in savings my escape-plan for when I turn 18 was sent down the drain. I’m wondering, is this legal? Should I call the police? Should I call social services? The optimal situation would be for her to lose custody of me and give me back all my money. I’m tired of living in this hellhole. Any help would be appreciated.

Update: The police told me what she did was illegal. I relayed this information to her and received my money back. I’ve decided to speak to her on sunday (going to friends’ place this weekend) and explain that if this (or anything similar) ever happens again, I’m calling social services. I shall now also start documenting any forms of abuse. Thanks for the help, everyone! I’ll update you if anything happens. Baii~

Edit: Once again, thank you. All of you. The responses and support keeps pouring in and I’m sorry I haven’t responded to everyone but the amount of comments has overwhelmed me a little. I want you to know I’ve read all of them and taken the feedback to heart.

Tyranny_sucks,2017-11-08 18:34:05+00:00,Feds came to question me about eBay purchases,"Connecticut, USA

Hi, so something interesting happened this morning to say the least.

Two federal agents came knocking on my door to inquire about my historic eBay purchases. I am a university chemistry student and I have an interest in amateur chemistry, so I have made various chemical purchases on eBay over the last couple of years, though I haven't ordered anything in the last 5 months or so since I've been at school most of the time concentrating on studies.

The federal agents want to question me later and they want permission to search the house. They're threatening me telling me that if I do not comply, they will reach out to my workplace and university so they can tell them I am a ""person of interest"".

I am definitely going to consult a lawyer regarding this, but I'm wondering if anybody here has advice pertaining to this kind of thing, or has heard of similar problems elsewhere that could shed light on my situation? Also should I consult a particular kind of lawyer?

The federal agents also asked me ""why I purchased so many flashlights"" and said ""flashlights can be used for making pipe bombs"".

She was going into the woods behind our house a lot recently and wouldn't say why so I followed her today. I saw her go into this hideout thing she'd made, a bunch of branches leaning against some rocks. It looked cool. I went in but, when I got inside, I saw all these bodies of animals laying out. They were dead and bloody. Some were cut up. 

She got mad at me for following her and said she's just curious. She used a knife to kill them and then she dissects them like in a lab. I'm sooo creeped out that's so gross and creepy. 

I feel like I need to tell our parents. There could be something seriously wrong with her, who does that??? She didn't care bcause she said, ""it will take you at least 20 minutes to bring them here and I'll just hide everything, I know everywhere in these woods and you'll never find anything I don't want you to find."" My parents always believe her over me, because she's younger. Plus I used to get in trouble a lot. There's no point arguing with her so I just went home now I can't stop thinking about it.

jt2893,2017-11-06 13:36:16+00:00,(Texas) Dealership gave repo company my vin instead of the correct one. Wake up and car is gone. My car is paid in full.,"I purchased a car 6 DAYS AGO, I've been waiting for years to buy and I've loved it so far, until this morning. The auto group that sold it to me called me and explained to me on Friday that they had accidentally given the repo company the wrong vin. 
         
Same car, wrong vin. So I've been parking it in the  back where hopefully the tow truck would be too big to fit in the tight space but I guess they pulled it off cause now my baby has disappeared.

  Where do I start off? I'm pretty livid that this happened 3 days after he said he tried to contact them.

[UPDATE 1] The General Manager just called and asked if they seriously came and took it after they left a ton of messages to the Tow company to not to take the car. He said whatever is wrong with it will be made right and he quickly got off the phone to jump someone's ass about the situation. Let's see how this goes.

[Update 2] I'm considering asking for my money back from the car, the warranty I purchased, my first months car insurance, and for them to pay for a rental while I find my replacement. They royally screwed up and I don't want to deal with the headache of them having to fix the car and it possibly never being the way it was.

Edit: Just to add the car in question is a 2011 Cadillac CTS-V coupe. So hopefully my worries about it being damaged heavily are more easily recognizable.

EDIT 3: Called the police and they told me it's a civil issue (go figure) and I talked with my attorney. He told me I have grounds for a full refund but I should have the car professionally inspected by a reputable Cadillac dealership and find out the damage and how much to make it right first and make a decision there. He says it's complicated for who is to blame because of the scenario. I'm going to contact another Police department and see if I can get an official report and call the repo company and inform them of the mistake just in case the dealership hasn't. The last contact with the dealership was over 3 hours ago. Still with no news to the whereabouts of my car. I had to find it myself.

[BIG UPDATE] after contacting the Tow yard they told me the dealership never paid for the car or after they got it from auction, so there was still a lein on the car so I basically bought a stolen car from the auction. I cannot deal with them after this. This is the shadiest thing I've ever been a part of and I'm dumbfounded I've found myself here. 

[Another EDIT] so they're trying to work with the finance company to get my car taken care of but it turns out my car wasn't the only one affected. This is happening to multiple cars all purchased through this company and I'm not going down without a fight. I'm getting out if this deal, it's way too hot for me.

[Update 6] dealer says they had bought the car on a ""floor plan"" which he explained is how they use the bank to buy a few cars from auction all at once. They closed this and paid the bank but the lein still exists until its sold and the automated system didn't pick it up that the car had sold and only saw a title transfer so it assumed I had taken it and just retagged it as mine. The dealer has offered me a loaner and says the car will be back tomorrow. He told me they could refund the deal if it really comes down to it but I would lose the money I spent paying taxes on it which is understandable. I'm gonna have the car professionally inspected and see if there's any damage and I'll decide then on how I want to proceed. This has been a roller coaster today.

[Edit thoughts] they say the car will be back tomorrow and I can use a loaner for however long but after finding it's been through auction I'm not sure on trust the car itself. I'm sitting on a spiky fence of letting my dream car go back and getting  my money back and finding another or just making the dealer fix the car. I feel like this is going to be a long road for me. I've missed a day of work and haven't come any closer to finding my car.

TalliVianl,2017-11-05 15:12:48+00:00,(Texas) My step-mother spanks my little brother as punishment and it's psychologically affecting him. [Update],"https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/77aer6/texas_my_stepmother_spanks_my_little_brother_as/

Okay so it's time to post an update as there has been progress. Thank you for your help. I told my brother to tell the school counselor. Someone from child's protective services visited him at school and later talked to my step mother and me. From what I understand there was nothing they could do. They did tell her that spanking isn't a good way for discipline but that was just a suggestion.

My dad and step mother figured I was behind this and decided to punish me. Step mother insisted on spanking, apparently she had consulted the pastor and thinks it's still appropriate to do that to a 16 year old. But my dad didn't agree. However I did point my butt towards her and told her she's free to hit if she wants. I was grounded 1 week for that (totally worth it as we laugh at it now).

But we're not hopeless. I searched a lot on teen websites and forums and there was good information about how to deal with parents who spank. We basically need to make fun of the situation. If she sees we've turned it into a laughing matter she won't do it anymore. So my brother is going to laugh when she does this, is going to volunteer himself and I will volunteer as well, just to make this a laughing matter. We've also bought a party prank poo smell spray and we used it once. She wanted to spank my brother for making too much noise, my brother sprayed that on himself a little and she sent him to take a shower, no spanking!

I know this is not the most mature way to deal with this but she is also not mature and this situation is not mature. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7ay2oh/texas_my_stepmother_spanks_my_little_brother_as/,legaladvice,1060,1,0.0

All I needed was a more with-it police officer. I went in person with all the documentation proving that my car is my vehicle and with my brother, and stated clearly that my car had been stolen and sold and we knew who did it. The officer I dealt with this time treated everything seriously and listened to us both.

I had my car back within two days. My parents had taken it and hadn't sold it like they claimed but were renting it to someone they knew. The car was retrieved from the rentee's house. I hadn't yet made a claim on it so it was returned to me the day after retrieval. My mother has been charged, and I've also been questioned about my parents drug use. I'm over the moon that what they did trying to rip me off has shone a light on more of their behavior. 

I'm still trying to gain clarity with my insurer about possible internal damage to the engine or transmission and having that thoroughly checked out, but that's beside the point.

As a bonus this was the last straw for my brother. He'd been still living under our parents thumb and this gave him enough reason to also cut them off and commit to acting against them. I have my car back and my brother back more than I did before.

What should I do with it? (Arizona)","She accused him of rape years ago. She was 18 and he was 22. It was false and never happened. He was arrested and eventually convicted. When he served his stance and got out he was broken. From what he told me, he was heavily abused during his prison time by other prisoners. He tried to get back to his life and he couldn't. His record, his name on the registry and lack of options. He went from being a student in a top college in the country to having almost no prospects. Within a year of being out, he committed suicide.

Yesterday was 3 years since his death. This cousin sent word through a friend that she wanted to speak with me and seek my blessing on visiting my brother's grave. I said yes, but figured something doesn't seem right. I went and had a recorder with me and recorded the conversation. Also had my boyfriend record a video of our meeting from a distance (it was in public). She told me she's sorry and my brother didn't deserve what happened to him. I asked why and pressed her for an answer, she broke down and said she didn't know who did it and she accused him because he had refused to lend her money she desperately needed and she was angry at him.

The voice recorder got everything, and the video also has audio in parts that match the voice recorder perfectly.

Are these evidence useful in overturning that decision? I want to make my brother's slate clean. Not only for his memory but also because he has a son he never saw (his girlfriend was pregnant when this happened, he lost his parental rights as a result of this conviction). His son should know this is not the kind of man his father was. If so, how do we begin the process? Do we need a lawyer here, or do we need to go to the police?

What consequences (criminal) will she face? Will she go to jail?

And, does my brother's estate have a claim against her for damages? Of course this belongs to his son now although I don't know how that would work with respect to his parental rights being terminated (doesn't matter, as we'd want his son to be supported more than anything else). And can his son have a separate claim for damages against her? This conviction deprived him of a chance to know his father, because parental rights were terminated.

I know this won't bring my brother back but it can at least provide some comfort to us and to his son, and maybe making things more fair.

badskeleton,2017-11-03 02:30:53+00:00,An old French woman is destroying my life [NY],"This is a long, very boring, and very stupid story. Bear with me. 

In July a 90-year old woman moved into my apartment complex. She lives in both a different building and number than I do but keeps getting her address confused with mine because she is insane. In July she called Time Warner Cable and managed to have my internet, phone and television service disconnected. It took four hours on the phone with TWC for them to figure out what had happened and reconnect me. They couldn't (wouldn't) give my original rate back, though, and would only give me internet for the price that I'd been paying previously. That was fine with me, because I never use the cable or phoneline anyway and because they gave me a reasonably generous credit to my account to make me go away. 

However, due to another series of wacky hijinks, they accidentally sent the balance of my old (cancelled) account to collections. After another two hours on the phone, TWC realized they goofed up and voided the balance of my old account. They say that they sent the paperwork to the collections agency, but the agency is still calling me. TWC says that it will take 30-60 days for the agency to clear the debt and that, in the meantime, I should keep telling them when they call that TWC has cleared the debt and giving them the date on which they did so. This is, unsurprisingly, not convincing the debt collection agency to leave me alone. 

Meanwhile this woman keeps calling TWC, getting into my account, and messing things up. I have now instituted a series of elaborate verbal passcodes which, in theory, one should need to supply before getting access to my TWC account. We'll see. Also, all of her mail is coming to my house. Like all of it. I've told the leasing office and they've spoken to her repeatedly but I'm still getting all of her mail. She's also signing up for things and having the bills sent to my house. I have no idea what else she's doing. 

Is there anything else I can or should do to protect myself (and my credit score) from this woman's confused blunderings? Can the repeated bills being sent to my apartment have an effect on me? I would think the answer would be ""no"", but then I'd also think she wouldn't be able to cancel my internet and get my account sent to collections, so what do I know.

youknowwhatyoudid_,2017-11-01 09:23:03+00:00,"My girlfriend was raped. The rapist is now trying to tarnish her character on social media, and the cops are moving painfully slow.","I'll start this by saying some areas of this post will be left intentionally vague to protect identites. Location is Oregon.


A few days ago my girlfriend went to a party at her friend's apartment. She is 19 and they are in their early twenties. Everyone was drinking at the party, and at some point a stranger showed up. He was an old friend of someone in their social circle. 


At the party he voluntarily drank. He made many of the party guests uncomfortable by being a little too touchy and trying to kiss random girls. However, since he was from out of town they didn't feel like kicking him out. 


My girlfriend doesn't regularly drink and went far past her limit. At this point most people at the party had left and they were winding down. My girlfriend could no longer stand, and the hosts brought her a sleeping pad and blanket. There was a guest sleeping on each couch, and another in the corner of the room. This left the stranger and his friend. My girlfriend invited her friend to share the sleeping pad, and the stranger forced himself in-between them. After about an hour the mutual friend decided to leave and offered the stranger a ride home, which he declined. 


At around 4am my girlfriend woke up still very intoxicated, but face down on the floor. In a couple second she realized she was being pinned down and raped by the stranger. She screamed and everyone in the living room woke up and threw him out.


I should mention that my girlfriend was raped two years prior, and had an extremely negative experience with the police and hospital where she was basically bullied into not pressing charges by the detective. She came home at 8am and didn't call the police until 3pm. Because of her previous negative experience at the hospital she was unwilling to do a rape kit, but the police officers took her clothes and the pad she slept on. Her rapist left a hat at the apartment which they also took. 


Some people at the party found his social media and let everyone know what happened. Now he's saying my girlfriend is a whore and was asking for it. After people responded he changed his story to saying someone at the party drugged him.

Now onto my questions:

1) Since he chose to drink would his intoxication during the event count as recklessness?

2) No one at that house tolerates drug usage, will his claim that he was drugged hold up at all? The police recorded his Snapchat story that we showed them where he was making lean and drinking.

3) At the party my girlfriend definitely kissed people, mostly girls. I don't have a problem with this and don't want relationship advice, but could that fact help his argument that she was asking for it?

4) Can we take action against him for the emotional distress he's causing my girlfriend?

5) He fled town after he heard the police were called. He has no permanent address and all we could give the police was his name and phone number. How long will it take before an arrest is made?

6) Do we need a lawyer?


EDIT: As many have pointed out the cops are not moving painfully slow. That was an overreaction on my part. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7a2hbb/my_girlfriend_was_raped_the_rapist_is_now_trying/,legaladvice,1478,161,0.0

As for the post subject himself, he's going around claiming that he knows ""who did it"" (and his evidence is flimsy), but no action can be taken because he has no legal grounds to. No IP address, no ISP logs. He got a police report against him for falsely blaming someone else, so he's been very quiet about it lately, I don't know much more because I keep my distance from him, especially on social media.

AngryJigglypuff,2017-10-29 20:04:15+00:00,[GA] Was badly assaulted at the haunted house I work at. It's been strongly suggested I file a civil suit but I don't know what to do.,"This sub is an addiction for me but I never thought I would be posting here. 

Background:

My current haunt is the top in the nation. It's been open 21 years. I have been here 5. I have worked a previous 5 years at another haunt before moving near this one. Because of the size and noterity of the haunt we have lots of police stationed there on the weekends as well as a staffed paramedic. There are many different types of spots you can work at this job but this season I am a ""lead."" I'm assigned 5-6 people of similar costume/spot to take care of. I walk through and check on all actors but I only give breaks to my assigned actors. All my spots but one are female actors. I break statues and our mermaid. I'm 5'6 and 130lbs and my people are in that range. 

Having spent the last decade of my life working at a haunted house I know you get hit. I can't even count the amount of times I've been hit, kicked, slapped, shoved, and stomped on. There are three types of hits you get. 1) ""ohohoho I'm so funny I'm gonna touch/grab the minimum wage actor."" 2) ""oh shit you scared me good I'm sorry I hit you."" 3) ""you kinda scared me but I'm an asshole with a tiny c**k so I'm gonna hit you a few times and laugh and keep going.""

This guy, though, was something I have never seen in my career. 

The incident:

I was cycling through my first round of breaks and was breaking a girl in basically a tall rectangular box. It's open in the front where you can reach out and scare the people walking by. It's maybe 3 feet deep. And the inside is rough saw wood. This spot is at the very beginning of this attraction. The first actual actor to scare you when you come in. A group of about 8 20-somethings African Americans came by and I scared the first two then went back to Statue Mode. 

A male (approx 6'2 and 220lbs) at the end of the group reached in and grabbed my arm. I said to him: ""Do NOT touch the actors."" And he let go and said ""Or what?"" And I  replied: ""Or I'll throw you out.""

He yelled: ""The fuck did you say, n****r?"" Then slammed be backwards into the wooden box. He started punching me in the side of the head. His presumed girlfriend (maybe 5'8 and around my weight) yelled: ""Not again"" and wedged herself between us facing him. She was yelling for people to help get him off me. She was attempting to protect me but also left me pinned with my head exposed. He continued to reach around her and continued punching my head. I was able to turn my head after several blows and he then grabbed my hair and was slamming my head into the wooden box wall a few times before he was pulled off me by my casting director. 

The spot I was located in was directly between the two curtains leading to our main backstage area. The female actor about 20 feet away (but around a turn) was able to run in and get immediate help. 

I remember immediately stepping out once he was pulled back and his girlfriend was able to move but then nothing for the next few minutes. I apparently made it a few steps before falling and seizing for approximately 45 seconds. Our staffed paramedic was on me by the time I hit the floor. I had epilepsy as a child but it was all light triggered. I haven't had a seizure in 7 years before this. 

He was immediately arrested and taken to jail. I was immediately put in an ambulance and sent to the hospital. My cat scan result were fine. I have two black eyes, lots of swelling on one side of my face, a 1.5 inch cut in a downward diagonal from the end of my eyebrow, and two smaller cuts on my face. I also am starting to get a lot of stiffness in my neck which I was told could be whiplash. 

He was charged with assault but I was told the DA is going to try to bump it to felony assault because of the seizure and cuts. There is security footage of him turning back to start hitting me and then me having a seizure but the closed box made it unable to see him hitting me directly. 

I have been advised by practically everyone to also file a civil suit against him. This would cover medical expenses and lost wages I believe. I'm missing a week of my regular job and two nights at the haunt so it's around $456 without taxes being taken out.

Do I have any grounds in a civil suit? How do I go about even finding a lawyer and such? My only court experience is watching Judge Judy.

This is going to be short, and has been proof read by my lawyer.

The short version is, we were sued. During discovery it was found that the window that was broken was not the ships original window, and it was not even close to spec. If his boat was anything more than amarina queen and fair weather sailer, it could have broken under way under typical use.

He tried to seem ""reasonable"" by accepting he was just as at fault as the rest of us parents, and he'd pay an equal share, which was not the end result.

In the end, we didn't have to pay a dime, he didn't have to pay our legal fees but they were not too bad, and I am absolutely amazed at how quickly this all got settled.

Last thread :
 https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/785da8/well_it_started_as_a_custody_case_but_10k_later/


**TL;DR** - No luck with contacting CPS, but great signs of hope from my daughters, their doctors, and Sheriff's Dept.

Let's call my oldest daughter RD and my youngest daughter MD to make it easier.

RD was supposed to have an appointment with her regular doctor this morning.  My ex wife texted me last night (10/24) around 10:45 saying the appointment was cancelled because : ""The Dr doesn't want to handle RD's medication now that she has a psychiatrist."" This IS the same Dr that has had RD on Vivanse and Adderal for years, so I'm not sure what the problem is now.  I texted back asking if I could pick up the girls tomorrow after school already knowing her answer.  She said no and that we're sticking to the parenting plan. I remained civil. 

I tried calling CPS 4 times today (Wed. 10/25)  No answer from the ""main investigator"". She was at work, so they gave me her cell phone as well. No return call, no answer.
I still made it down to FL in time for RD's afternoon appointment with the student psychiatrist. I arrived at 4 PM. MD was in the waiting room with mom and step dad. I pasted on a smile and did the best I could.  MD's face lit up when my wife, my son, and I arrived and hugged us.  RD was going to the back to speak to her psychiatrist.

When RD came out of her appointment, she had her school backpack with her. She smiled and asked if we were going out to eat.  My ex said they were going home and she and step father started to leave.  RD and MD followed 10-15 steps behind with us.  RD told me showed her psychiatrist all of her writings in her journal. I asked her ""All of them?"" She said ""Yes. I'm done with this, I'm standing up for myself daddy."" I nearly melted. I told her ""Well that's great!"". I was so proud of her, but in the back of my mind I also couldn't help but to think how rough the night was going to be when she got home. She was acting a good bit more bold tonight. By this time, we were in the lobby. We put in our final hugs and kisses, and they left. Step father was calling their names, and being overall rude.

Afterwards, I went right back to the Psychiatrist's office and left her a 15 page document explaining my situation, along with copies of text messages and a timeline. She did not look at it as they were closing, but I'm assuming maybe she is tonight, or possibly in the morning. I figured if my ex wanted to go in and tell her ""Story"" that I can go in and share my facts.

My wife and I left.  On the way out we ran into the ""main doctor"" from the family psychiatry clinic by chance.  I reminded him he had just met me at RD's follow up at his office a week ago. I told him that I think it's a bit of a sign, that I have something important to tell him, and I asked for 5-10 minutes for a quick rough run-over which he accepted.  I explained the timeline to him and when I got to the medical records -- specifically a section were RD noticed blood on her toilet paper in 2011... he had heard enough. He told me that I needed to get a GAL.

I informed him that I had a few others recommending that, but my attorney said it would be $3,000. He said they should be free in my case, and I needed to check and see again. I then told him that my fear was that I didn't want their mom and step dad to find out. He agreed that they didn't need to know yet. I could see the sincerity in his eyes.  He told me that he would make sure to talk to the other Dr. about it before her next appointment. I have to be honest, it felt great for him to listen to me. I didn't hype up anything, and I didn't lie. That's at least a good feeling in all of this, and that is, even if I'm doubted, even if I'm ignored, I know I'm being 100% honest.

We left there motivated. My wife and I went to the Sheriff's office. We waited in the lobby and a deputy came in to talk to us. I had all of my paperwork ready to go. I broke it all down to him, and gave him the 5 page timeline/cliff notes from 2010-2017 of every major event that has occurred that backs up RD's claims of sexual abuse. He was taken back a bit. He said that it was apparent that I wasn't just throwing stuff out there and making allegations. He agreed that I had a very legit reason to be concerned. 

He called his chief, and an investigator. He informed me that they would be going out and talking to the children ASAP, and that he personally would make sure that it was handled correctly. I mentioned to him that they all needed to please read all of the facts I provided. He made copies of a few more documents and even joked that ""It's not a problem, I just wish some of the people I deal with were half as thorough as this"". He said that he ""can't even pretend to know how I feel"" and told me I was doing a good job. 2 in a row? Could it be... that we are finally being heard?

I told him that while I loved the sound of ""ASAP"",  I didn't want them to go question the children only to send them back inside the house. I fear that's only going to make matters worse on them. He said that more than likely they will remove the children from school and conduct interviews with them both tomorrow. Oh.. I don't think I'll sleep much until I hear back from them. But I also fear that my children may be scared. (This is after all the same uniform that just sent RD to a psych hospital.)

Either way, our story is being heard, and I can't thank you guys enough. I feel like I was possibly stuck in a rut (denial even?) and needed the extra insight. Instead of being flooded with bad puns, every single person contributed in a positive way, with solid advice and help. It's uplifting to say the least. 

Today was one of the very few days that I can actually put a mark on the calendar of being a good day. I didn't get much time with the kids, but I made progress towards it.  I just had to update... I didn't sit and stress, I stood tall and fought, and although I know today wasn't a home run, at least I got on base.

I'll try to keep you updated.

yesimpettyhelpme,2017-10-25 03:45:44+00:00,[Update] (CA) Neighbor keeps inviting people to park in my gated drive-way. What happens if I lock the gate and refuse to let neighbor's guests access their cars?,"I'm glad to report the neighbor's guests parking in my driveway are no longer a problem.

The reason I always left the gate open was because it was busted. The gate will slide close, but will not open without extreme force (basically a bunch of people pulling/pushing at the same time.) There was something preventing it from just rolling back open after being closed and I was too broke/mechanically challenged to get it fixed so I had no idea what the problem was. 

A few nights ago neighbor has a party and invited a bunch of people over. Last time this happened, neighbor had a bunch of people park in my driveway of course and I guess some people got double parked in because some genius decided to solve this problem by parking in my driveway and *closing my gate*.

Well, come time to leave he realizes he can't get the gate to open. He asks me for help, but I tell him two people ain't going to cut it, I'm injured anyways, and that I'm going to call the police and report him for trespassing if he can't open the gate and get his car off my property. He can't open it, and it's too late at night to call anyone so I tell him I won't call the police if he promises to come back bright and early the next day with enough people to get the gate open again. 

He showed up the next day with a repair man who fixed my gate and paid the full cost himself. 

I now have a working gate that I can close so douchebag neighbor can't tell anyone to park here. Or at least he still can, but fuck him, my driveway is CLOSED.

I did what you all told me to do. I wrote a letter, had my mom sign it and sent it to the superintendent's office. I also called them. They said they will speak with the school.

I was called into school and the principal's office and was told to take the test there in his presence. I did that, the math teacher came and looked through all my answers and said it's another perfect score and wanted to leave.

I said loudly ""I think you owe me an apology.""

She said ""yes, I should not have accused you of cheating.""

I said ""Yes, and another apology for saying I don't have the mental faculties to get a perfect score.""

She said ""I'm sorry"" and left.

The principal said ""don't push your luck kid.""

I said ""It wasn't luck, and you also owe me an apology.""

He apologized and said my suspension is reversed and it won't go in my records. I then went to the counselor and told him that now in his 24 years, there is one student who was accused of cheating and proved the teacher and administrators wrong, so he shouldn't give bad advice to the next poor student who is in my place.

So things are sorted out now. But also, I'm not going to be arrogant or aggressive like that with people. I only spoke like that with them because they have said incredibly mean and insulting things to me and I was very pissed off at them. And the counselor had given me horrible advice.

ThrillSky6,2017-10-24 11:53:16+00:00,Oklahoma state. School disbanded our humanist student society for offending religious values. We only quoted the bible.,"Okay so we received notice that our humanist student society in a public school has been disbanded because we have offended religious values of the good student of our school (exact words).

There is a Christian student society who do not like us at all, because we are seen as the cooler group among younger students and we attract smarter people and now our numbers are comparable. They don't like this at all and have done everything to cause trouble for us.

Recently they put up a poster with our logo crossed and quoted the bible 1 Corinthians 15:33: *Do not be deceived: ""Bad company corrupts good morals.""*

We reported this to school and argued that it's targeting us and it's insulting and rude, and school said they are only quoting the bible which is their right. We asked if we can counter that, and they said we can't because that would be alienating people for their religious beliefs. We think this is an unfair privilege.

We first posted a poster quoting Mathew 7:1: *Do not judge others so that you will not be judged yourselves.* Then said that if you're looking for people who actually agree with the philosophy of Jesus rather than pretending to do so, join our society. 

School put this down, said it's targeting them because we're arguing they are not true to their faith and that is us unfairly targeting them. We asked how we can use the bible, they said as long as we are quoting the bible and not implicitly referencing another group, it's fine. Even though that society is *explicitly* referencing us in a very negative way and they don't seem to think it's an issue.

I admit that we were quite frustrated, decided to take the offense here and posted a poster quoting Colossians 3:22: *Slaves, obey your human masters in everything.* Then wrote that if you don't like what you read in the bible, you can join our society.

It was removed and we were notified yesterday that our humanist society is now disbanded because *our philosophy and practices* were an offense to religious values of the majority of students and we were advised to join other religious societies, every single one of them are Christian societies. Do we have a first amendment violation here?

And what is the best way to challenge this decision? We can contact ACLU or other secular organizations. We can put our money together and hire a constitutional lawyer, we can try contacting the superintendent's office, we can rename our society and start another one. We don't know which one is the best choice for us.

So I went through the hassle of writing up an eviction notice for ""Alisha"", the girl I allowed to couchsurf. I gave her a formal notice for 30 days. She ignores this. Eventually, I move this dispute to court. 

Alisha made the claim that she is paying rent, and has done nothing wrong. I tell my side of the story as well, all of it. The judge says it doesn't seem like Alisha has done anything wrong or broken any laws, and that she is paying rent. Judgment comes up in her favor, and she is allowed to stay. Judge says I can appeal at a later time.

Yep, Alisha is still living with me. She knows I loath her, she doesn't care. I've moved most of my stuff to my bedroom like my TV, consoles, etc. She's taken over the lower half of my home. The only reason I even venture down there anymore is to get food from the fridge which she still mooches off of. So I mostly have to put non-perishables in my bedroom to keep away from her. I lock the door with a key. 

Alisha has a job now at a retail shop so she's making money and at least is out of the house for some time.

Boise, Idaho


Here is an update since my last post. 

My wife got her friend to confront the friend and her boyfriend who they thought took him. They were recording the whole interaction. The friend and her boyfriend pretended they had no idea who my wife was- even though the girl has came over to our house multiple times over the years and is best friends with my wife’s sister. Our dog banjo was at the door when they answered. 

After my wife’s friend confronted them and told them they were going to get the police involved, they slammed the door in her face. 

My wife talked to a cop but was told they couldn’t do anything that night since the couple that took our dog lived in the next by city. My wife gave them information about it all and gave them the girls number who took the dog. The cop called her and left a voicemail after she didn’t answer. 

The cop then called my wife and told her to go to their house with the cop on the line. They then acted like they didn’t have a dog, even though they just saw the dog when they first confronted them. The cop told my wife to leave the house because the girl wouldn’t even come to the door to talk to my wife. 

The cops told my wife they will call her back once the girl responds to the cops voicemail. Ten minutes later, the girl who stole the dog texted my wife saying they will give her banjo back as long as they don’t involve the cops (sketchy). 

They met up with them and got banjo back while being cussed out for stalking them and finding where they live. 
Banjo is now home and I’ve never seen my wife so happy with tears of joy. 

As for my wife’s sister who is currently living with us and was a part of the whole process.. is playing dumb and acting like she didn’t know about it until a couple days ago. 
We will be having a sit down discussion with her once she gets home and will be giving her an eviction notice on when she needs to be moved out. I will let her know and will be recording the whole conversation as well as writing an eviction notice document. 

My wife is beyond upset she would be betrayed by her sister, especially after we were only charging her $50 a month on rent with her own bathroom, letting her use our car to get to work and even feeding her, so she could save up for a vehicle for herself. As much as I hate being mean to people, I can’t allow her to live with us any longer and will be cutting off letting her use the car today.

I just really hope she learns a lesson from this, just as much as I have. 

Thanks everyone for the advice and opinions. We really appreciate it. 

Now onto my next updated:

I’ve read every comment you guys wrote and I completely agree with you all. 

First off, I’ve never really had a dog before because I am not an animal person sadly. My wife on the other hand- is the biggest animal lover I’ve ever met. See would literally adopt every animal she has come across if she could. 

I wasn’t aware pugs had such issues sleeping outside, even if he slept in a insulated doghouse. Some more background information is we didn’t let him sleep outside until two months ago. He would be inside all day until around 7 pm and sleep in his dog house. Around this time, the outside temperature was averaging 70 degrees outside. 

Another piece of information I’ve learned is my wife has actually gave banjo his worming shots and that tick stuff you give a dog. We live in a subdivision with a decent sized gated backyard. So i wasn’t worried about animals attacking him. 

Because of the feedback you guys have given me, I have talked to my wife and we will be making banjo an inside dog from now on. We will also be making sure he gets taken to the vet and get all of his shots and checkups. 

I apologize if I upset anyone about the way we treated banjo. I didn’t put enough effort into thinking about his sleeping and veterinarian needs. I am currently in the process of potty training our 2 and 1/2 year old son and have been putting more effort than anything else making sure he is learning and using the potty. 

So we will be working our hardest to give Banjo the best life he can. My wife loves him more than anything and treats him as another son. I’ve honestly never seen anyone love a dog as much as my wife loves and treats Banjo. He is super happy and excited to be home and my son gave him a big hug as soon as he got here. 

Thank you again for everything you guys have helped me with. Advice, thoughts and your opinions. I will work my hardest to make sure we can be he best dog owners we can possibly be. I’m just glad he is home. 

Thank you guys again!

NotSoSadNow98765,2017-10-20 01:11:05+00:00,[AL] Contract termination by religious employer because of medical emergency [UPDATE],"Some of you may remember me. I posted [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6p4uko/al_contract_termination_by_religious_employer/) a few weeks ago but I couldn't remember my password. Things have shaken out and I want to provide an update for people who want to hear it.

First, we were able to trace back the source of the information transmitted to my employers. Due to a legal agreement I will not be sharing further information about this part of the situation. I ask that people respect this decision, but rest assured that I am satisfied with the outcome.

I didn't get my job back. Those who stated that the reasons for termination are irrelevant in the Church's teachings were correct. My administration was willing to let me appeal the decision if I could get the support of the Bishop (even though he didn't make the decision, they did). I knew that was probably not going to happen, and I reached a point where I didn't want to beg for a job that barely pays a living wage. Especially not over a personal and heart wrenching choice that was never supposed to be their business in the first place. I'm taking the school year off and working on coursework for another degree.......... and nesting because we officially have a little one due in June 2018! It's very early, but what little they can see this early looks like it's where it's supposed to be this time and is measuring normally, so we're keeping our fingers crossed. I will always grieve for the one that didn't make it, but I am thankful for this one.

towingthrowaway123,2017-10-19 12:55:21+00:00,Car improperly towed. Huge repair bill. California,"I drive a 2016 Nissan GTR. It was towed yesterday from my driveway. A neighbour had my vehicle accidentally towed (she said a blue Nissan, the fucking idiot tow driver ignored the illegally parked Altima and took my car). Anyway, for those who aren't car people, the GTR has a rather bespoke all wheel drive system and if not towed properly, it can cause damage to the drivetrain. 

I picked the car up and the diff has been grenaded. Even worse, I called Nissan up and they said if you tow the car improperly, you void the warranty. I'm now looking at a multi thousand dollar repair bill. 

I went to the tow company and they told me to take it up with the HOA, as they're the ones who have contracted the towing company. The HOA has told me to go after the towing company.

Jeza6829422,2017-10-18 13:03:31+00:00,Update - My brother went missing 6 years ago. Police came yesterday to ask if we have seen him lately but didn't say why? How do we get more information. Illinois.,"https://redd.it/74we5z

I talked to the officer in charge of the investigation for my brother being missing. They found his name written in a notebook which belonged to a drug trafficker. The officer who was looking for him was wondering if my brother was still missing after talking to the officer in charge of that investigation.

There days later we received the call that they may have found my brother's remains and they needed DNA samples to confirm. DNA confirmed it was him.

What happened was that when he went out that day he saw his friend and they went to see another friend (of his, not my brother). That was a drug dealing location, things went bad when my brother was there and someone was heavily beaten up which my brother and his friend saw. That's when they decided to... His friend was kept silent under the threat for his life (he was dealing for them). Recently he was arrested and confessed and reported my brother's murder to get a better deal.

The officer says my brother didn't die in pain. It was multiple gunshots. You'd expect after 6 years of playing this possibility in our heads we would have been prepared for it but we weren't. We had a funeral for him. Now there's a place that I can go and talk to him and at least feel a little closer to him even though he's gone.

I thank all of you who helped.

RollingExpat,2017-10-16 12:56:10+00:00,Update! [California] Neighbour constantly blocking my wheelchair access ramp,"[Here's the link to my original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6dj4qh/california_neighbour_constantly_blocking_my/?st=j8u5lhg8&amp;sh=e0c0b34e)

Hello!

The person who directed me to this legal help forum mentioned that it's customary to give updates once significant progress is made in a case. So, since I'm currently sitting in a car, still a couple hundred miles away from home, this is as good a time as any to tell you guys what's been going on. :)

Following your advice I contacted the authorities to have the area around the ramp marked out as a no-parking spot. They weren't able to help me since the street is owned by my neighbourhood's homeowner association. Now, my house is one of the few in the area that is not part of that organisation, but I decided to contact them anyway. The president turned out to be a wonderful lady who was of immense help to me. She helped resolve the parking situation by designating the area around the ramp as a no-parking spot. I felt bad about inconveniencing my neighbours, but the homeowner association agreed to my idea of extending the street parking zone by a few yards on the other side of my neighbours' house, that way they still have somewhere to park their fifth car. She did all that as a gesture of goodwill without me being a member of their organisation, which made me fall in love with the neighbourhood even more. Also, I'm really glad I didn't have to involve the police.

Since my accessibility issue has been resolved I've decided to pull the trigger and buy the house I live in. I'm currently in the process of finalising the purchase which is taking slightly longer than usual due to a complex ownership situation, still at this point my estate agent is assuring me that there should be no more roadblocks, which makes me really happy. Once I'm the owner of the house I'm planning to join the homeowner association as well. I've also been asked to become their accessibility consultant to help make sure all of their future projects are wheelchair friendly, which is a huge honour to me and makes me confident that this is the right place for me. :)

On top of all that, I've reached an agreement with the homeowner association and two other couples to build a second ramp a little further down the street and split the cost between all of us. Every party, including the homeowner association will be covering a quarter of the price and we have a promise that this time a no-parking spot will be marked out immediatelly. :) The project is set to begin once the purchase of my house is finalised.

Thanks once again for all your help! What started out as a nuisance has become a fantastic adventure that reassured me that I've found a place I can truly call home!",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/76qa6o/update_california_neighbour_constantly_blocking/,legaladvice,5169,2,1.0
Erica-seli,2017-10-15 19:34:50+00:00,"(update) School wants my son's Facebook password &amp; email, also wants us to hand over any phone or computer that he's had access to in the last year. WTF? [Florida]","This is an update to [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6pcmwx/school_wants_my_sons_facebook_password_email_also/).

I went to school and asked what's going on. I did that both to confirm that the call was genuine and to see why they want to violate my son and our family's privacy on such a massive scale.

First, the call was genuine and it wasn't a scam. Second, the principal explained the situation to me. It had to do with another student who attempted suicide because of bullying during the summer. Thank goodness she is now alright (and has since moved to another school) but this was part of the school's investigation to figure out how it happened.

When I asked how is it any of my son's business, they said they've seen them hang out together and while they don't think my son was involved in the bullying himself, they'd like to read his conversations with her because she may have confined in him about the students involved in bullying. I asked why this information wasn't obtained from the parents of that student, the answer was that they weren't willing to work with the school about it and she had left so they had no power (strange use of words in this situation) over them.

I told them to leave my son out of this witchhunt and the way they're speaking to us they sound like they're trying to bully us into helping their anti-bullying investigation which is troubling and absurd. I told them that if they ever approach my son or try to take his phone or anything by force or threat I'm going to make a big deal out of this, talk to the superintendent and hire a lawyer.

Up until this day, they haven't said or done a thing.

I talked to my son about the girl and what happened to her, he knew her and they had some mutual friends but they weren't exactly friends and he wasn't aware of her suicide attempt. He only knew that she had left the school. He showed me their conversations and there wasn't much there except talking about movies and tv shows.

In short: they backed off after I made sure they understood that I won't take any harassment or violation of our privacy lightly.

Small edit; thanks for the couple of who messaged me the mistake. Someone messaged me and asked me if the parents of the girl had allowed the school to share the suicide news with me. I will try talking to them to make sure. They deserve to know if the school is not respecting their privacy, it's something they seem to be good at.

Drummermitr,2017-10-13 13:49:12+00:00,[MN] School is accusing me of cheating with no evidence. I'm now suspended and want access to my social media and email to prove my innocence.,"I'm being accused of cheating in a math exam. I am 16 years old. I got a perfect score in the exam and the teacher asked me to stay after the class and she told me that she knows I cheated. I didn't cheat. My math has always been good except last year when I was dealing with depression. She says she knows someone of my mental faculties will never be able to get a perfect score so I must have cheated.

I told her that I didn't cheat and I'm offended at the accusation. Two days ago I was asked to see the principal who said the same thing, that I should confess to cheating and tell them how I did it so that they can stop other students from doing it. He more or less threatened me ""this can go very well or very bad for you depending on your cooperation with us.""

I told him that I'm happy to retake a new exam right now or at any other time to prove that I didn't cheat but he said that I could have had time to prepare since the time my teacher talked to me. I told him that if their evidence for my cheating is my lack of mental faculties then no amount of studying should make a difference? He still did not agree for me to take another exam to prove that I could get that score.

Yesterday I was asked to his office again and he told me that he knows about how some students are cheating and offered me a clean slate if I let them access my social media and emails to find out who they are and if I give them evidence of other students cheating he will let me retake the exam. I have no knowledge of what he is talking about and I declined access to my social media and email.

I'm now suspended for disobedience of school staff and lack of cooperation for proving my innocence from a cheating charge. This to me sounds very unfair and I can't help but feel like I'm being targeted here for maybe a personal reason? Because this does not make any sense. They have no evidence that I cheated and refused my offer of retaking the exam and they insulted my intelligence.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/764vzw/mn_school_is_accusing_me_of_cheating_with_no/,legaladvice,7501,407,0.0

noethe99,2017-10-11 15:49:33+00:00,[UPDATE] Falsely accused of rape by my Mom.,"Justice has prevailed. The police called me saying that they investigated and that they are concluding that the claim is bogus. They are dropping it completely. I'm so relieved. Now to commence picking up the pieces and getting power of attorney or guardianship or whatever so that this doesn't happen again.  Thanks to everyone for the support. It really helped during this really terrible time. 

[update] Mom tried calling me. I immediately pass the phone to my brother. Apparently, she wanted to come home. He tells her that it is not a good idea and that she can't just make an accusation like that and then proceed as if nothing happened afterwards. She didn't seem to get it and talked about the devil is trying to break up the family.
[Update #2] My mom called me again asking to come home or at least to bring her some of her stuff. I told her I can't talk to her and can't see her.

Original story is below:
So I've been taking care of my mom along with my dad for years. She has MS and her mental health has been tenuous for years. Talking to herself, and just questionable behavior in general but usually rather level headed. She once falsely accused a doctor of doing or saying something sexual during a procedure and since they're were like 5 people in the room during it. It was easily dismissed as well crazy talk. We continued to care for her at home. We attributed her extreme behavior to a thyroid condition/ the MS. I take her to specialists. She gets on medication for the thyroid and the MS brain... well I figured from what we read the confusion was apart of it but it's never been to the point where my dad and I didn't feel like we couldn't manage her.

Now fast forward to today. My dad is going through heart issues and has been hospitalized for days. Leading to today where apparently he tried to hurt himself and is now on psychiatrist hold in the hospital and won't be discharged today after all. I make the mistake of telling my Mom this. She seemed fine but like 2 hours later while I'm walking the dog. She calls the police. I come home to an officer outside of my front door asking to be let inside. I'm mentally like not again ( she had called the fire department like a year ago when my dad was again in the hospital about a non-existent fire) and I let him inside. My mom then proceeds to tell him that I raped her the night before. I'm like completely caught off guard. I tell the officer everything. They decide to take her to the hospital for evaluation. At this point, I'm just done. I really want nothing to do with her ever again. The feeling of betrayal is off the charts with me. She needs more help than I can offer. But now the police want my DNA.
[Edit:] I realize she's not well. My initial anger has abated and now sadness over just everything is my chief emotion.
What should I do? I'll give the DNA but should I get a lawyer? I don't have much money.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/75pxxi/update_falsely_accused_of_rape_by_my_mom/,legaladvice,2805,2,0.0

I watched the VHS tape and it was of my uncle going on a 25 minute speech about government conspiracies and how banks cannot be trusted. That's why he kept his savings in cash. He didn't even trust a safe deposit box. That's why they were kept in his walls. And it was $120,000 as he said it in the video. I found the other $20,000.

I went to a lawyer and showed her the will, the video and she said  it's surprisingly common for people to leave cash inheritances in our area. She talked to the executor of the will as well, and then wrote a letter for me to give to the bank which explained this is from a cash inheritance with contact details of the executor in case the bank needed to contact them.

I scheduled an appointment with the bank. When I told them it's for a cash deposit they told me I don't need an appointment for that but I told them it's for a large deposit. They still said no appointment is necessary, but then I said it's a very large deposit. So they booked the appointment. Everything went smoothly at the bank. They made a copy of the letter that my lawyer had prepared. Money was in my account a few hours later.

I made payments and my student loans and car loan are both paid off and I now have a larger emergency fund.

Marleycatold,2017-10-10 12:27:24+00:00,(Massachusetts) Lawyer threatening to sue my wife's cat rescue for not adopting out cats to him.,"My wife runs a cat rescue in Central, MA. Her rescue's process is to show cats to prospective adopters. If they like a cat, then the rescue takes an application and then checks references including the potential adopter's veterinarian. They have been adopting cats out this way for more than 10 years.

Yesterday a lawyer wanted to adopt on-the-spot. The rescue refused. He filed an application but did not include a vet reference. 
 
The rescue denied his application. Then he threatened to sue using MGL 93A. 

As it turns out this lawyer has a history. He is known to the police and animal control. A dog of his killed another dog. After repeated calls into the rescue, the rescue asked him to stop and said that if he didn't stop the rescue would ask for a restraining order.

Any recommendations? Support?

stabbedandfired,2017-10-08 16:27:21+00:00,Update. Stabbed at work and fired for my troubles.,"So before I give the Update, I wanted to say a few things. 

First I am not some Jiu Jitsu, Muay Thai, Taekwondo, Krav Maga, or Patrick Swayze Roadhouse style bar bouncer. I am not a veteran who obtained my sick martial arts skills in the streets of Mosul. What happened was simply addrenaline and a decent amount of martial arts training I received when I was a kid kicking in. Although I do occasionally work out at the gym at my work so I am stronger than your average network admin. Also for those calling bullshit in the PMs saying that a punch to the jaw will not knock you out, well I have a small lesson. A well placed punch to the jaw can cause minor to major brain trauma as the act of your brain shaking about in your head can overload the nervous system making you lose consciousness. Your muscles instantly relax and you fall to the ground with no memory of the last few seconds. 

In other words go watch some UFC... 

Second. To the people in the thread and in my PMs, I did not punch him in retaliation for stabbing me. His knife was still inside me and his hand was on the knife when I punched him in pure fear. More like 100 percent pure terror. 

So on to the update. The company I worked for is a wholly owned subsidiary. This will be important later. The CEO of my company was unwilling to hear my side of it no matter how many times I tried to approach him.  The best response I got was when his secretary gave me the line of ""trusting the decisions of HR."" Several emails and 2 phone calls got the same response from him and his assistant each and every time. Because of the fact that no one at the office is willing to even hear my side, I decided to go to a lawyer that was recommended through a friend. Friend contacted a lawyer he used in the past who referred me to someone he trusts. Upon hearing my story the lawyer was very eager to take my case on contingency.  As an added bonus, he decided to represent the other three guys who helped out that day as well. 

The lawyer decided to name the parent company in the suit along side our former employer. His reasoning is that the parent company would have reviewed all corporate policies that the subsidiary has and that they would have had final say on the policies and procedure. This would have inevitably included the zero tolerance workplace violence clause that caused us to be terminated. 

Well the parent company, a company with many public contracts for city and state police in the area I might add, was not too happy to hear about what had happened. The event was apparently downplayed when it was reported to the parent company. They told the parent company something along the lines of ""A scuffle broke out in the office. As a result one of the employees was seriously injured. All employees involed will be terminated and Law enforcement are handling the criminal aspect."" Paraphrasing but that was the jist of it. 

Upon hearing about the truth of the matter, they were VERY quick to set up a meeting with us. This is a company that is in the self defense and security business. Not to be confused with people in the firearm business. They do not sell firearms, but do provide armor, non lethal options, and have security subsidiaries for police, security firms, and private citizens.  

Given the nature of their business, they know full well the damage that negative press could do if word got out that one of their subsidiaries fired a guy who fought for his life. This was the PR nightmare that gave us the edge in the negotiations.  The subsidiary I worked for is not in the self defense business. They are a security monitoring firm that only handles corporate contracts so they were not worried about that kind of press like the parent company was. Upon hearing the full details of what went down that day, the parent company went into panic mode. 

The three guys who held down my attacker wont be getting their old jobs back, but they were offered jobs doing the same thing at parent company's facility 12 miles away. They will also be compensated for lost wages at time and a half their normal pay rate for the time they were out of work. Parent company pretty much directed our old company to comply with this offer and our old company cut them a check. Since parent company has better benefits and better pay, this was a slam dunk victory for those three. Cherry on top for them is this means a closer drive for all of them. This offer was contingent on the three guys not going after either company for monetary compensation outside of what was offered, and the signing of a non disclosure agreement. With the NDA and a signed contract guaranteeing employment for at least a year, barring obvious reason to fire people, it would have been stupid of them not to take it.  

For me it was a little more complicated. They are very willing to offer me the same thing, but there are complications from infections that occurred from the stabbing as I developed MRSA in the wound. Fortunately it remains localized in my wound and has not spread to my blood stream, however if it progresses any worse than it currently is, my doctor thinks it may be prudent to cut out the infection. It is being watched very carefully and I spend probably 2 days out of the week in the hospital having the wound drained. In the meantime I have been offered the job, plus the ability to be paid while I work from home. This would allow me to get on their excellent coverage plan. (they only have a 1k deductible for single person) 

My lawyer basically told me that this was the best possible deal I could get without going to trial. He explained that the parent company can take the hit on the publicity and survive, but that since all they have to do is offer me a job and get the old company to pay me for the time I was out of work, why not? Minor expense to them and they do not have to worry about bad publicity. I took the deal they offered and signed a non disclosure agreement. 

So TL:DR of that one is that the each of us were offered compensation for lost wages and offered better paying jobs at the parent company. Far as I know our former job is paying the lawyer fees. We did not pay a dime for his services. 

As for the guy who stabbed me? I was very pissed off to learn he was offered a plea deal. His charges were reduced from attempted murder to aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. Since he was a model citizen before his knife wielding episode, and since this was a crime of passion, he was offered a mere 1 year in prison and a year of probation plus a 10k fine. I am told that there is the possibility that he can have his record expunged and that he can be out in as little as six months. I know that he has not appeared before the judge yet to take this plea deal. They were waiting to see if I would die as the charge would obviously change from agg assault to murder 2. Once they found out that I was stable and that the MRSA was not life threatening, they set a court date for the 12th. I will be there. 

Because of the fact that a lawsuit against him right now would be a lawsuit against his wife and child, I decided not to do anything on that front. Going after him would be a cash grab and would only hurt two people who had nothing to do with what happened that day. So I see no reason to sue him. 

Also before it is asked, yes I am taking extreme measures to deal with my MRSA. I have paid a company to come in and clean my house 4 times so far, I am taking my medications on time every time, and I am following doctor instructions for cleaning and replacing bandages. It is getting better, but my doctor thinks I will be dealing with this all the way until after valentine's day.

Jjones-zino,2017-10-06 18:50:54+00:00,UPDATE: My brother is in prison for something I did. I want to own up and make sure he's released.,"[OP](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5roeab/my_brother_is_in_prison_for_something_i_did_i/?utm_content=title&amp;utm_medium=user&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=frontpage)

I really really wanted to make things right with my brother but it seemed like it wasn't a good idea. I talked to a lawyer who went through everything and told me that if I confess my brother may get reduced sentence but maybe not as he will still be charged with possession and destruction of evidence and he will not be released from prison. So nothing will happen more than the chance of a small reduction. I will also get charged and will likely go to prison for a few years.

I talked to my brother and he doesn't want me to do anything. He says punishing myself will not help him and he'd rather I stay out of trouble so that him going to prison would count for something. He says if I also go to prison then what he's been through will be for nothing.

I've made a promise to myself. I'm gonna stay out of trouble, study well, work hard and make a lot of money and give half of everything I earn to my brother for the rest of my life. It's a big promise but I will keep it. He's there paying for my sins and it's not right. I hope I can stay strong and do whatever I can for him as he's been strong for me.

z00gie,2017-10-06 12:06:54+00:00,[AR] My husband hid notifications from me regarding custody of my daughter from a previous relationship. Now I'm afraid I will lose my joint custody because I never responded to these letters and calls that I never received.,"I have a 4 year old from a previous relationship. We have 50/50 joint custody. When I got married my husband changed and decided he didn't want to take me to see my daughter anymore so I was not able to see her for a couple months. I have a disability and have trouble getting around on my own, I can't drive because of it so getting to her without help just wasn't possible.

When I left my husband over this, I found a ton of letters from my ex's lawyer about an amendment of custody. Saying things like that I had agreed to give the father full custody, but I did not. I found out that my husband got onto my private email and emailed my ex and pretended to be me and told him that I didn't want custody and that he could have it.

So now I'm not sure what I can do. I did NOT write that email. I do not want to give my ex full custody. I never received one letter from my ex's lawyer, nor any phone call. I called them and found out that they have been trying to get ahold of me for months! My husband never told me they called. 

Is there anyway I can keep the current custody agreement that my ex and I have since my husband fraudulently ""gave permission"" to let my ex have custody? Also can my husband be in any sort of legal trouble for purposefully withholding my mail from my ex's lawyer?


Edit: To clarify, the father of my child is not my husband. He and I never married. The man that I did marry is the person who is keeping all of these legal documents from me.

collegehomethrowaway,2017-10-03 20:47:10+00:00,Can my dad really hire a bounty hunter to kidnap me from college and take me home? (MS/TN),"I'm a freshman at a good school in Tennessee. My dad is a really difficult guy and has just gotten worse since I left for school. To make a long story short, when I stopped checking in every day he started calling the dean, and when the dean's office stopped taking his calls he started showing up here. The school really had my back and banned him from campus. 

Now he's calling my friends and their parents and saying I have to come home (my mom won't take his calls anymore and the court won't make her). My dad says that I ""lack the legal standing for self-determination"" because I'm a minor, since in Mississippi you're a minor until you're 21. He says that he's hired a ""youth transportation service"" to ""escort"" me home. Like those people who kidnap gay kids in the middle of the night and take them to conversation camps. Bounty hunters for kids. 

I told him that the fugitive slave act is a goner and that I only have to obey the laws of the state I'm in, which designates me an adult with the right to remain unkidnapped. He said that I'm bound by the ""long arm statute"" and that I haven't even established residency in Tennessee because I've only been here since mid-August and I'm still registered to vote in Mississippi. 

So I guess my main question is my title: is he right, can he really send someone to kidnap me and take me back to Mississippi? My mom says this is just him being crazy and trying to intimidate me but obviously I want to cover all my bases.

If he's wrong, what can I do if that actually does happen? If some guy comes up to me and zipties my hands and says I have to go with him, do I? Can I fight back? If my friends are nearby and see me being kidnapped, can they help me? Since the episode that got my dad banned from campus, I've had a couple hefty guy friends offer to walk me back and forth from class. If one of them is with me and someone tries to take me, do they have to just let it happen, or do they have a right to help me not get kidnapped?

I think that's all my questions for now. Thanks!

Tl;dr: stopped talking to dad and he says he's going to have a bounty hunter bring me back to Mississippi because there I'm still technically a minor/child. Can he really do that?

Soon after I moved the signs I found a letter in my mailbox with basically a petition signed by a bunch of local parents asking me to take the disturbing sign down because their kids walk by my house on their way to school. This is exactly what I was worried about in the first place- people associating me with the signs. 

Soon after *that* my landlord emailed me back saying he has a right to have them up because they're ""fixtures, like fences"" and he is allowed to erect fixtures in the lawn. I ended up getting a big sign printed apologizing for the last signs and saying I was not the one who put them up and I do not condone them, to try to remedy my reputation with the community. I also wrote the same in a letter to the parents who sent the petition. 

As for my landlord, I paid a lawyer to write him a letter telling him that I have a right not to have these things in my yard, that it's disrupting my life, etc. My landlord came over all huffy but he did remove the signs.

Below is the official update!


I have called a lawyer! After some in-depth searching and a few calls, I have connected with a relatively local lawyer (I'm a bit rural) and we talked for about an hour. He wanted ALL the details I had, especially when I mentioned the arborist; he asked for the number and told me was going to ask for additional information from the inspection that would be important for a lawsuit. He also gave me the number of a surveyor, and told me I should call them asap. He then set me up with an appointment at his offices next week after the arborist's visit. As far as the criminal charges, he told me that was my call, but we could talk more about it next week. He did comment that making a police report was a smart move, so thank you reddit for that advice!! Lastly, he told me not to contact the neighbor anymore, to get a written/signed testimony from the witness neighbor, and to report any documents in the mail from either my neighbor or the company that did the job, as well as refusing contact should the neighbor come to my door. I asked if I could continue updating you all and he said that was fine so long as I don't disclose personal information (which I won't obviously!)

So it looks like I'm taking my neighbor's ass to court! I hope somehow I can get my trees back, even just having new ones planted.

About a month ago, I was driving on a 3 lane road by a beach in South Florida. I was on the right lane, and merged into the middle lane. After I was fully in the middle lane for 3-5 seconds, she merged into the lane from the left lane, hitting my car and causing damage to the body and door. She made eye contact with me and I gestured for her to pull over. 

She then took off, and drove away. I caught up to her, and my mother in the passenger seat took pictures of her car and license plate. We called the police and they quickly tracked her to her home. The police asked that if due to her age (she was 90) and the fact that she was terrified because of the accident, we could write it up as a normal accident and not press any charges. They also gave her a citation for improper lane change, and wrote the accident report as her fault.

I made a claim with her insurance and yesterday I got a call from Progressive, asking to get a verbal statement of the accident. I gave a full truthful account, but declined to mention that she fled the scene of the accident, as I was asked to by the police. 

Today I wake up to the news that her insurance (Progressive) is only paying 50% of the accident cost, and they filed a claim with my insurance (Geico). They say that because I was only in my lane for a few seconds there is no way to know whose fault the accident was. Its also worth mentioning that the insurance agent who called me stated that they were going to take full liability (but not during the recorded part of the call). I have a 1000 dollar deductible and don't want my rates to go any higher than they already are. 

So my questions are:
Should I sue her for the remaining damage? And if I do should I mention being coerced by the police to not mention the hit and run?

Is there any appeal I can file with Progressive/ Geico so my rates don't go up?

What would you do?

My landlord called me after reading my email. He was really shocked that the previous tenant did this, said the guy didn't have any criminal background and wasn't shady or anything. Whether that's true or not I don't really care because my landlord is awesome and made everything right.

He's coming over tonight to install a completely new doorknob and deadbolt set, and said he plans to have a locksmith rekey it between tenants from now on. He went to the old tenant's new apartment and confronted him. The guy claimed he thought it was his and it was an honest mistake and gave it back to my landlord. I call bullshit, because the house was completely empty when I moved in, this dude knew he didn't leave anything behind, but whatever. The guy apparently also said he didn't take any cash, but my landlord told me to just take $200 off the rent next month because he feels partly responsible for not changing the locks and doesn't want me to feel shitty about my new place right off the bat.

Now I told all of this to a friend at work who thinks the landlord was in on it and is just trying to fix it now so I don't report it. He thinks it's too good to be true that the landlord could get the laptop back that quickly and then be so generous to just give me $200 of his own money. My friend is kinda paranoid so I'm taking that with a grain of salt, maybe he's right but my gut says this was just a shitty tenant and a good landlord taking a small financial hit in order to have a happy tenant. 

I'm really happy with how everything turned out. I will be setting up a little hunting camera pointing at my front door so that if the landlord does end up being shady, I'll catch it if he comes in or anything. But for now I'm going to trust my gut and believe he's a good dude.

I heard nothing more until last month when her bf (now ex) turned up at my doorstep in peace and asked if I knew where my ex was. She’d disappeared without telling him or any of her new friends and workplace. I filled him in on how she’d done the same to me and to a group of friends after me.

https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6ebbq9/had_a_falling_out_with_the_girl_i_love_and_got/?st=j7t8o97k&amp;sh=7aebba6a 

Oh boy. I've been wondering for a while whether to post here again or not. I wasn't going to, but I know my last post ended up on a few other subreddits and I actually stumbled across it on my main account on r/niceguys and I read all the comments there. It was rough for me to read this original post, but it was a reminder of what my own mindset, and the mindset of so many men like me, was. I decided I needed to post again for some closure. I would have posted this on r/relationships, but they don't let you update posts they have taken down (yeah the mods there actually took down the post, not me). 

For those who didn't see my original post on r/relationships before it was removed, it included more detail than my last one here, so I'm going to link to a thread from r/niceguys from a few people saved the text of my relationships post in the comments. I want to take full accountability for everything, so I want to link it here:
 
https://www.reddit.com/r/niceguys/comments/6f696j/nice_guy_on_rlegaladvice_wants_to_know_his/?st=j7t8wz5j&amp;sh=badbe0c6 

First, I want to assure everyone that I didn't contact that girl ever again. Since I moved, I no longer see her or go anywhere by where she used to live, go to school, or work (I don't know if she still lives in the same area or goes to the same school. I have avoided getting any information about her at all). The way I acted and the way I hurt her and scared her so much still haunts me. Part of me wants to track her down and apologize, but I know from my classes that 1. that can re-victimize her all over again; 2. it would be a selfish thing to do because it would be to clear my conscience, not make her feel better. If she wants to get closure by talking to me, I'm sure she can find me somehow; and 3. I don't want to make the mistake of using an apology to make her feel manipulated to talking to me again. I learned in my classes that men do that a lot. I don't want to hurt her anymore, so I will work past the guilt while never talking to her again. 

I was distraught after my last post here. I admit I came here looking for validation, not help. I had a warped sense of entitlement that led me to believe that no one would possibly disagree with me, but obviously, hundreds of people told me that I was fucked up, a predator, a stalker, and that I needed help. All of these people were right. I don't know what happened, but something clicked in me after seeing those comments (despite how combative and abusive I was in response to the comments). I checked myself into therapy in Michigan the week after I posted here. I knew something was wrong, but I was still in denial. I thought I needed help with heartbreak. I didn't recognize that I actually needed help with identifying and combatting my messed up belief systems that I used to justify stalking and victimizing that poor girl. After a few sessions, I started seeing a psychiatrist too. I got on mood stabilizers and I started to realize that something was very very wrong with the way I was acting. Something that couldn't be cured by medication. After talking it over with my therapist, I decided it would be best for me to move out of state into my Aunt's house. Within a month of me posting here, I had moved into her house. 

After moving, I started the process of transferring to a new school next semester, working full time, and continued to take my medication and was transferred to a new therapist. I had a fresh idea of the issues I wanted to work on in therapy, but after a few weeks of having two therapy sessions a week, my therapist pointed out to me during a session that I was still exhibiting the same kind of obsessive behaviors over women that earned me a cease and desist letter in Michigan (though I wasn't stalking anyone at this point, I was just obsessing in my mind. Which is still bad, but I wasn't actively victimizing anyone). I realize that in addition to therapy, I needed more help. My therapist pointed me to a class run by a local agency that was designed for men that have committed violent crimes against women like domestic violence, assault, sexual assault, stalking ect. Most of the men in the class are court-ordered to go as a condition of their probation/parole, but you didn't have to be court ordered to go, so I signed up voluntarily. I attend a two-hour class session every week and have been attending for about a month now. The goal of the class is to help us recognize and change abusive/violent behaviors.  I know most of you are thinking: what kind of monsters can't recognize violent behavior? People like me. People like me in the last post. I look like a normal person. I grew up in an upper-middle-class neighborhood. Monsters come in all shapes and sizes and I fooled myself by saying because I didn't ""look"" like an abuser or because I wasn't ""like"" the abusers I saw on TV, that I wasn't one. But I am. I can't take back what I've done, but I can promise myself I will never victimize anyone else again. 

In conclusion, a lot had changed for me in three and a half months. I want to say that I do not blame my behavior on my mental illness or anger or the media or whatever. I made a conscious decision to stalk and terrorize another human being because I thought I had the right to dictate how others interact with me. The class is a year-long class and I have only been in it for a month, but I have already learned so much. I have learned from my group that abuse is always a conscious choice and a learned behavior. But I believe that since I've learned this behavior and it's voluntary, it's totally within my control to change it. I've also learned from my group about the importance of having a non-romantic support system, so I made some male and female friends at work that invite me over to play video games with them. Don't worry reddit, these are actual friends and not just people I am stalking or believe I am in love with (I talked about this extensively with my therapist and try to be cognizant of my obsessive tendencies). 

Thank you to everyone who told it to me straight and I'm sorry for how I decided to treat everyone who was just trying to give me the advice I asked for.

**tl;dr**: I ceased, I desisted, and I got mental health help. Thanks to everyone.

**EDIT**: Wow, just wow. I didn't expect this response. I guess this is a top post of all time. 
I wanted to say some things for anyone who reads this in the future:

1. I read every single comment in r/bestoflegaladvice even though I didn't reply to many. I cried a lot while reading them. 

2. I didn't post this to be gilded or to be patted on the back. I'm not sure why I did it, but I don't think ""congrats"" is quite the right thing to say to me. I don't know if I deserve praise for being a normal human being with normal relationships. But thank you all for being so supportive anyway. 

3. I've had at least 10 people ask me for the name of the program I am in. The program I am in is specific to my area, so I'd rather not disclose the name. However, I encourage anyone who is concerned that they are controlling or abusive in their relationships with partners, family or friends to google ""batterer intervention programs in my area."" I did some research today about the class I am in and that is what these types of classes are called. They all operate a little differently based on where you live and what program you do, but we use stuff like the power and control wheel and there are steps in my program. There is no official federal program I don't think.

4. I am not healed. I have a lot of obsessive thoughts and I have to try really really hard to have appropriate boundaries. My meds have helped with this, but it is a behavior and thought process I need to change and that cant be done with pills. I have a lot of mental health issues (duh, based on my first post) but honestly what you saw was just the tip of the iceberg. I have never had real ""friends"" until the ones I have now. Before Jaime, I definitely engaged in stalking behaviors with both women I had crushes on and men I wanted to be friends with. It was never as bad as it was with Jaime, but I still am sure I made people uncomfortable.  I also have some self-harm behaviors I am working out. So to the person who was worried that I would use all of the good praise to say ""oh I'm perfect now so I can do what I want,"" trust me, I know I am fucked up and I want to change. I want to have normal relationships and friendships. I want to not be known as ""that creepy kid"" at my new college. 

Please get help if you need it. Take it from me: all people are capable of changing for the positive. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/71cjfn/update_had_a_falling_out_with_the_girl_i_love_and/,legaladvice,26179,3,0.0

So my mom had manipulated me into lying that my step father had assaulted me. She also lied to the police and my step father has been in prison for three years.

This is just a short update. On the advice of many of you here I talked to a lawyer. After going through everything she told me that it's almost impossible to get guaranteed immunity before I confess. But the chances of me facing consequences for my false statements is about 25%. I decided to do the right thing and face the potential consequences. It was better than having something on my conscience.

I don't want to get into details. But I talked to my step father's lawyer and the police. My stepfather will get a retrial and he is out on bail now. No charges are filed against me but my mom is being charged. She is also out on bail until her court date. She has disowned me. It's sad but I did the right thing. My brother now lives with our grandparents.

I grew up in a Muslim household with abusive, controlling, manipulative parents. Although we were investigated by DYFS when I was younger, nothing was ever done about it. My younger sister and I have basically been prisoners in our own home, we were never allowed to do anything except study and practice religious customs. 

After I graduated uni, I was expected to marry a woman from our home country. That was when I ran away from home. This was a few months ago. Since then, my father and uncles have been following me and harassing me. I tried to get a restraining order but was denied due to lack of evidence even though I already started a paper trail of their harassment. The police seemed to just not care. I moved away from one state to another. They still somehow found me.

I feel like they are just going to keep finding me, likely because they have access to my social security number and other sensitive information. I don't have social media so it's not through that. My question is, is there any legal way for me to seal my information? Can I change my identity to avoid my family finding me?

013579975310,2017-09-13 09:26:52+00:00,[Netherlands] UPDATE + THANK YOU! Boss sexually assaulted me. You guys helped me. Yesterday he was convicted.,"Hi all,

I hope it's ok to post this here. I just want to say a big **THANK YOU** to this community. 

I can't find my original post, since I deleted my older account, but more than a year ago I posted on here asking for advice about sexual harassment during a job interview and some of you told me that what I had described was more than harassment, that it was assault. By that time I had already taken the job, for many reasons I won't go into and thinking that something bad couldn't possibly happen again - don't judge, the therapists and social workers explained how my reaction was in fact normal. Trouble is the man sexually assaulted me again, and also hit me.

Now, that's where you guys come in: commenters on here had suggested I talk to my boss about all that happened and tell him what he did was not OK, but said I should do this all **in writing**, which *I did*. Lo and behold, since the police refused to talk to the witnesses who were present (I couldn't believe it either), **it was the written messages *you* suggested I write that proved my case**! So THANK YOU!

But wait! There's more! After the incidents I was broken and couldn't work for 6 months. During that time, and because of the comments on here + the insane amounts of alcohol I found myself consuming, I did some research online and came across various resources for victims of sexual assault, which helped me rebuild enough of my dignity to keep going (rebuilding myself is an ongoing process). But my gut told me to press charges and so I did, and check this: the man was taken to court. Turned out he had raped another woman not a year before he assaulted me, and had I not pressed charges he wouldn't have been taken to court unless he assaulted someone else and *they* decided to press charges. So I think it's not presumptuous to thank you on behalf of the other woman.

As for the verdict, given everything I've seen here in the Netherlands, I wasn't expecting much but I felt I'd won a battle on behalf of victims everywhere simply by having my case taken seriously, and another when I learned he was going to be taken to court. The fact that he was found guilty comes as a bonus, even if his punishment is a couple week's community service. Yup, that's it, a little community service.

I sent a picture to my property manager and she said she was concerned it might be termites. She said she'd call a terminator to set up an inspection.

She then called me back and told me I had to be at my apartment during a three hour window she set up with the terminator in order to let them in the apartment and she would not be present for the inspection. I told her I can't just miss a three hour window of work to wait around for a terminator. She said the terminator can't give any less than a three hour window and they are only available during business hours during the week -- so there would be no time we would be able to reschedule when I am not at work. She finally agreed to meet the terminator this time, but she made it clear that in the future if there are any repairs or anything needed to the apartment that I have to make myself available to let the individual into my apartment. 

My question: is it legal to require me to be present for repairs? I'm especially wondering if this termite inspection indicates there are in fact termites, and there are follow up visits from the terminator required , am I going to have to be present for those visits?

Sidau6,2017-09-11 17:05:05+00:00,I was filmed against my consent at a party. (UPDATE),"[Last Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5b1zon/i_was_filmed_against_my_consent_at_a_party/)

History: Myself with another girl did nude dancing at a private party with our best friends. In a private villa where expected things to be private. A pervert had followed us and traspassed and took a video from a window and posted it online. I asked if we have legal options against the person.

We went to the police. Myself, the other girl and the host of the party (owner of the property) to report it and see if the police will do something about it. They didn't. They said the uploaded video itself is not evidence for trasspassing and the nude/erotic nature of the video will not count as revenge porn, as there were people present at the party so we couldn't have an expectation of privacy.

It sucked. I didn't care about the video being out there as the chances of someone I know seeing it is probably less than getting hit by lightning (and even if they do it's not a big deal) but my friend was devastated because her family are very strict about these things.

BUT this didn't end there. This perv didn't stop. He tried to sneak into our other parties as well but we knew better now and we had security. They got him and handed him over to the police. So he was charged with trasspassing and they also found a camera on him with footage of women's bathrooms. They took his stuff and found out that he's been posting a lot of revenge, hacked and stolen porn and nudes online.

He's now locked up. Our video is also down and his accounts on porn sites are suspended.

It took many months and him fucking up again but we finally got him.

stabbedandfired,2017-09-07 21:54:43+00:00,TX- Disgruntled ex employee came back to work a week ago and stabbed me. I am being fired because of it.,"I just now got out of the hospital. Last monday on the 28th, I had an old employee we let go on friday come in. Now this is not unusual as people generally forgot things when they leave. I asked him what he was doing here. 

He said he needed to talk to me about what happened. This guy was let go for budget reasons. Simple as that. We cut 5 employees and he unfortunately made the cut. 

I informed him that there was no real reason why he was let go. Just a business decision and that we would have glowing letters of recommendation for him, will not interfere with unemployment, and will actually give good references for everyone who called. 

This point he claims its bullshit and gets hostile. I try to calm him down as does many other workers nearby. His friend tried to say he would take him to lunch and pay. Basically everyone knew he needed to leave at this point. 

He seemed to calm down, but then pulled out a pocket knife and stabbed me in the stomach. I did not even realize I had been stabbed yet as I saw the knife and reacted. I grabbed his arm and held it firmly. The adrenaline was running through me so much I did not realize I had been stabbed yet until I saw the blood. I started to panic and punched him with my free hand in the jaw a few times. I guess one of them hit home as he dropped to the ground. 

I sat down in on the ground holding the knife in me as I knew it was probably the only thing keeping me from bleeding out. The other workers that were there held him down until the police arrived. The ambulance took me and I went in for surgery. 

Today i receive a phone call that I do not have to return to work. I told my boss that I would be ready for light duty on monday. He said that my health was not what he meant. One of the HR guys saw me punch the fired worker a few times and said that my face was like ""A vicious animal."" Exact words. 

I told my boss that this was to be expected when fight or flight kicks in. He agreed with me and said that he wished he did not have to do this. But that everyone who got physical with the former employee will probably be let go pending a review by legal. 

This will make me lose my insurance. I am worried about continuing medical issues. The stab wound is still infected, but I have been given both pills and a cream for this. 

I am mainly worried about losing the job. Is there any kind of suit I can bring up if I am fired for this? I know you can sue someone for anything you want, I am asking about suits that would have a reasonable chance of winning given a good lawyer. 

Also is it legal for my job to fire me and the guys who helped over this? The guy was only out for maybe half a minute so he was still a danger. It took the police 12 minutes to show up. Hello the ambulance was forced to wait outside for 5 minutes until the police showed up to secure the situation. This guy had plenty of time to harm other people.

I worked at one hospital during a storm and I was there for over 100 hours before I was relieved and I was paid for the entire time I was there.  They even gave us OT.  However, my leadership here is saying that we will only be required to be working for 12 hours per 24 hours we are here and therefor they are only obligated to pay us for the time we are actually at work.  We will not be allowed to leave the hospital when we are on downtime.  The hospital is setting up cots where we can enjoy our “time off”.


This doesn’t sound right to any of us.  My understanding is that if I am required to be at work, I am required to be paid.  I understand they are not obligated to pay us overtime until we actually work more than 40 hours in a given week.  But not paying us at all while we are at work seems ridiculous.  


I should also say that the hospital will remain open.  Closing will not be an option.  


I will also say that being available for hurricane staffing is a condition of employment that I and everyone else agreed to in order to work here.  Personally I am happy to be available during disasters as that type of dynamic is something I enjoy on a professional level.  


Finally, I have been through at least 8 hurricanes in my life including Andrew.  I am well prepared for this one.  I have water, food, cash, the shutters are up, the house is ready, the hatches are battened and the main sail is reefed!

comatorium53,2017-09-03 15:46:46+00:00,Fainted on +3 hrs idle airplane with no AC,"Last week,  I was to board their plane going to Paris from NYC. The flight was delayed several hours, and they had us on the Tarmac for over 3 hours without AC while they fixed an engine power problem - it was above 90 degrees on that idle plane, with no air circulation. The conditions were completely inhuman, which resulted with me vomiting, taking off my clothes and losing consciousness before being dragged off the plane with an oxygen tank and sent the hospital. There is video documentation of the entire event taken by another passenger.

To summarize, the entire scenario is a complete nightmare - passengers were screaming, trying to get off the plane but the flight attendants said no one was allowed to de-board the plane. People were crowding in the service areas trying to get tiny cups of water to stay hydrated, the bathrooms were backed up with huge lines, everyone was dripping in sweat. The police were finally called onto the plane after 3 hours not because I fainted, but because a passenger decided that the only way he would be let off the plane is if he broke the law - so he lit a cigarette, creating an extremely hazardous situation, and the airplane doors were finally opened.

I ended up in the hospital with no belongings - no shoes, house keys, laptop, etc.; everything was still on the flight to Paris. Because I had no way of getting into my apartment, I went straight to the airport from the hospital in order to see where my belongings were. Arriving at 5 AM, I was told to wait until 8 AM for the airline workers to come in, because they were the only ones who had access to the storage room, where my bags “might” be. When the employees finally arrived, I told them I needed to find my belongings immediately and needed to rebook my flight to Paris as soon as possible. 

The airline staff told me it is impossible to rebook or refund my flight because according to their system, the incident was never recorded. When asked about what my file said - it stated that the flight was delayed and that I never boarded! How could that be possible when my boarding pass was scanned, and my bags were on that flight? They said my only option was to provide my credit card info so they could use the info to buy me another flight, to which I coldly declined. This was the same conversation I had with 3 different representatives, one in person at the airport and two of their agents via customer service (phone).

Now a week later, I am in Paris with my belongings (except 160 eu that was stolen out of my carry on after the incident). The airline finally started responding to my claims after I made a public post about them on Facebook describing my incident. They offered me refunds for all my flights, compensation for breaking ""EU Regulation 261/2004 art 7,"" as well as several other expenses in my claim. However, i haven’t replied nor accepted because I am waiting to see what a lawyer can advise.

I am not sure how to proceed with filing a lawsuit. I have been searching for lawyers who have fought similar cases. Also, how does one select a lawyer that is best? What are some good questions to ask the lawyers that contact me back about taking my case?

Tl;dr - Kept on idle plane for over 3 hours with no AC, started vomiting and fainted - wheeled out of plane to hospital. Airline refused to refund / rebook my flight.

Me and my two sisters inherited this property from our grandparents. It was their rental property. We demolished and rebuilt everything from scratch for ourselves to use as the main home for our family. We built a pool and a sauna. We live here now.

During construction the HOA president visited me and told us that that our design violates HOA's renovation guidelines. He also said that the pool and sauna are violations of the bylaws. I reminded him that we're not members of the HOA and have no interest in joining.

In the last 6 months we've received numerous letters from the HOA either compelling us to join or inform us of our infractions. They're either about the pool, about the fact that we have 3 cars, or that we're not a single family (apparently brothers and sisters are not family now according to this HOA).

We also received letters saying if we join the HOA the fees will be waived for the next 5 years.

This last week though the president brought us a form showing that there has been 45 signatures by the neighbors saying our way of life and our non-compliance with the HOA bylaws has significantly devalued their properties and has cost them stress and they would want us to become a member. The president says this is enough to get a court order requiring us to become a member. He says the neighbors will be willing to testify in court as well. He says to avoid the legal fees on both our parts, he's willing to give us the 5 year waiver of the fees.

First I have no intention of joining this HOA. They've proven themselves to be exactly the type of HOA to not want to be associated with.

Second, is it true that a court can order you to join a HOA? This seems weird. Are they bullying us into joining?

I called payroll at my old job to figure out what I needed to do to move my retirement plan to my new job (my old job is a non-profit and the new job is a for-profit company, not sure if that matters). Old job has terrible retention and does everything they can to keep people from leaving (they refused to confirm or deny my employment dates for my new job, among other nonsense).

Payroll told me to call HR who is just one lady (pretty small company). HR lady said that retirement benefits are only for employees, and by turning in notice/getting fired I ""forfeited"" my retirement savings, which have been ""redistributed into the general company pot"". I told her that that is absolutely not listed in the employee handbook, and she said that by signing my employment agreement I agreed to follow all company policies and procedures, which can change at any time. 

I was only there for 5 years, so I know I wasn't fully vested and not eligible to receive the funds that they matched, but 3% of all my paychecks went to my 403(b), is it legal for them to just keep that? I've read on this sub a bunch that agreeing to an illegal policy doesn't necessarily make it legal, does that apply here?

Thanks for reading.

Tl;dr: resigned/was fired from old job, they said this means they get to keep the money I contributed to my retirement. Legal?

itsmeagain27,2017-08-31 01:33:46+00:00,"(california) Teenage daughter in middle school denied access to bathroom in class, has period accident and is harassed by teacher. What are my legal options?","My teenage daughter is in her first year of high school. We suspect she has fibroids because she has a heavy period. We don't have a formal medical diagnosis, but we never anticipated this situation.
She has one teacher who has made her uncomfortable. She says he made a few off color jokes about women not understanding some of the content of the class- he teaches history and english.

Earlier today, she desperately had to use the bathroom because she could sense wetness and knew her period was too heavy to be contained with a liner. Sorry if this is graphic.

The school bathroom policy is allegedly asking permission and it's up to the instructor to let you go or not. To my knowledge, they don't have passes or hall monitors? 

She raised her hand like halfway into the class to ask for permission to go to the bathroom. The instructor said no. He was giving a lecture and my daughter claims she asked politely. This instructor said she could wait another half hour or whatever it was. She said ""I can't wait"" and he said something along the lines of ""your hair looks fine, you can wait until the end of the class to brush it."" Some people in the class laughed. I interpret this to be mildly sexist, and I am willing to demand that my daughter is removed from the class.
She ended up bleeding through her pants, tried to wash it in the bathroom, and was late to her next class. She called me sobbing during lunch time because she had to borrow someone else's jacket and sit in period stained underwear for the rest of the day.

My question is: what is my obligation here to notify the school or report this? I am livid and want this teacher, who is treading on the line of being inappropriate to begin with, to realize that sometimes a bathroom emergency is not a hair emergency. I bought a recorder for my daughter to put in her backpack and record his lessons because he is borderline sexist and if this happens again I want proof to show.

What can I do? I live in Orange County, California.

First off, I am not an adult in Alabama until I am 19 years old, so the advice you can give may have to be a little different.


Anyways, on to the situation. My mom has owned a restaurant for 6 years. Recently, it's been doing poorly. My dad has been begging her to close it down and get a different job. Instead, to ""save"" her restaurant, she's been writing bad checks to food suppliers in order to keep it open. And these checks are in my dad's name. I have no idea how much they owe. I'm assuming around 1000$?


I got my very first real job two weeks ago and am also balancing college. (I have a full tuition + fees scholarship, and have an incoming Pell Grant that I want to use for books.) I was anticipating buying a backpack with my first paycheck but my mom said she needed it to pay the house payment. So I gave it ($180) to her.


Now that my Grant is coming in, my mom wants it too. 


I don't know what to do. Am I selfish for hesitating to give this to her? Should I give something to her? Is there anything else I can do? Please help me. Thank you.

CPSStalking,2017-08-27 21:13:56+00:00,"New York - I've been visited by CPS 8 times, to enquire about a child I don't have. At what point it becomes harassment or stalking?","There's a CPS agent that seems to be convinced that I have a child and I'm locking the child in my home. First time I was visited, I was very understanding. I allowed her to search my house without any restrictions. Everything seemed fine. Obviously no child and no evidence of one, because I don't have a child.

This was repeated 4 times in about 2 months by the same agent, until I stopped cooperating. I told her that from now on the only way I'm going to allow access to my property will be with a search warrant. A few weeks later, she came with a police officer, without a search warrant. The officer told me that it will be a lot easier if I allowed them to look at my house, I allowed the officer to do that by himself. Again, no child was found. His search was very thorough, looking for hidden basements or doors in walls or something like that. 

Two more times she has visited me to talk about my child and these times I have refused to talk to her. Once, as I left home to go to work she was there to ask me questions. It definitely looked like she was waiting right outside my house to get a hold of me. I called the police but it went nowhere. I have called the CPS office in my area 4 times to file a complaint but they go nowhere. This last incident happened this last Thursday.

This woman has contacted my neighbors, my brother and sister, my coworkers and my employer already. Everyone has told her that I don't have a child. 

This definitely seems like a personal obsession on the part of the agent. If this was a legitimate CPS operation with reasonable evidence for what they're claiming, I'm sure they could get warrants after all this time and even put me under surveillance I guess? But they've made no efforts to do anything as far as my complaints have gone. So maybe her superiors are in on it, or at least don't care at all.

This is really going too far and is affecting my life. I actually fear for my safety now. I will install security cameras this week and will call the police if I found her waiting around my house but they don't seem to care because she's with the CPS.

Do I have a legal recourse here? Like filing a restraining order against the CPS (or against her), or maybe informing some different authorities to press charges for stalking? This definitely seems like it, at least in the layman's definition of the term. Not sure how stalking is defined legally. What's the best way to stop her?

Iwork4thedevil,2017-08-25 15:11:59+00:00,My company certainly isn't the most ethical... but is what they're doing illegal?,"I work for a therapy clinic that works with patients (mostly kids) with SEVERE medical and behvioral issues. It's more expensive than a lot of colleges to attend, so a certain level of care is expected. I've been here over a year. 

Reasons I'm curious if they are crossing the legal line;

*They tell parents that there is a RN on site for medical emergencies. This is not true.

*They say that everyone that works here has at least a Masters, when in reality some of them aren't even finished with their undergrads when they start working here.

*They pay everyone differently; men make far more than women. A guy who has been here less time than me makes double my salary, and I have more experience. 

*They tell the parents of kids that the therapist working with their child has been thoroughly trained on them, when actually therapists often work with students they've never met before, not knowing the child's history of seizure activity, allergies, or level of aggression. This happens several times a day where someone is working with a child they are untrained on.

*They say they don't have money and need very expensive equipment  (as in $10,000 machine) and ask for the parents to donate it to us, even though our tax records say we make at least a million dollar profit every year and we spent a LOT of money on other expensive things.

*We bought a million dollar home to house families visiting for other countries.  So far though it has only been used to house the owners immediate family, which our clients are unaware of.

*Owner says she doesn't make a profit from here but on the tax records it states the Executive  Salary is six figures.

*Owners kids have very high paying jobs and titles, even though they do not have the qualifications, and one of them isn't even physically  capable of doing the work he's supposed to (I know this isn't illegal, but it is really annoying).

*We are sometimes asked to sign papers saying that we can't tell parents if a child has a seizure during the day, because they don't want the parents to worry.

*Parents are often lied to about where their tuition money is going,  what their child's day was like, and other things.

Could it be considered fraud that they say the money they are being paid is going to one thing, when it's really going to something else entirely? ? I'm so sick of the way this place treats their clientle.

Edit:  it is a registered nonprofit in Georgia.  Is there an organization I can get in touch with to anonymously report these things?

Edit: If I'd known this would get so much attention I'd have been more clear on some things. We are not ""therapists"" as in psychologists, but I didn't want to use the term we use at work for ourselves. We also have to sign a non-disclosure agreement when we are hired saying that we won't discuss our internal workings until a year after we've quit (yeah I know this is kind of breaking that). A lot of people are saying to talk to a lawyer but I am in medical debt up to my ears already and make less than a schoolteacher, so if anyone knows of a way to speak to a lawyer pro-bono, or one who would consider getting paid another way (maybe by the Whistle Blower award someone else mentioned?) I'd appreciate it, as I am just unable to figure this out 100% on my own, and I definitely can't afford a lawyer anytime soon.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6vz38z/my_company_certainly_isnt_the_most_ethical_but_is/,legaladvice,1443,202,0.0

Last year I received a job offer to work as an assistant professor in the German language department at a large university in Michigan. I recently finished my PhD and was really excited to fill a research position (and possible post doc position) in the specific field I applied to. 




Most of my time I give classes in German literature but additionally the university would like me to help students with writer's block so I joined an interdisciplinary workshop. 

There are at least 4 people connected to this workshop and we get along fine most of the time. Sadly there is one elderly woman who made me out as a rival day one. 

I do not know what provoked her but there is something about me that makes her mad.  Cue the incident...I had an appointment with a student, gave him some tips and instructions and left my bowl with gummy bears on the desk. 

Mind you, these gummy bears a sugar free and volatile, if you eat more than a handful you are in serious fart troubles and you will occupy the toilet bowl for the rest of your day.

But my co-worker ate the whole bowl, first she excused herself from any commitments and then she called in sick. The next day she confronted me and blamed me for the whole ordeal, that I deliberately placed those gummy bears and it was all a ploy to humiliate her. 

According to her she has already informed HR and her lawyer and that I will be kicked out of the country in no time. The only thing I can blame myself on is that me and my colleagues giggled at her bowel distress signals.

legalhelp34,2017-08-17 15:57:05+00:00,My lawsuit was dismissed four months ago and my lawyer didn't tell me until now. Is this illegal? (Michigan),"I was in a car accident almost two years ago and contacted a personal injury attorney I found online. The driver who caused the accident was drunk and driving the wrong way down a one way. I got a broken arm, two herniated discs and a few other misc. injuries. My car was also totaled. 

My personal injury lawyer sued the driver of the vehicle in November of last year. They haven't really been good at contacting me, no one ever called me with updates and when I would call for updates I would get the run around. I only met my lawyer once when I went in to sign my paperwork. Other than that, I only am allowed to talk to the ""business manager"". Whenever I called and ask for my lawyer I'm directed to him. He always tells me it's fine, these lawsuits take a long time, they are handling everything, they will let me know when money is offered by the driver. I have never been involved in anything like this before so I just trusted them.

I had surgery in the beginning of April for an unrelated issue. It was a very serious surgery that involved three months of recovering. I told the lawyers office about it before hand and they had me send them an email giving them permission to call my husband with any updates on the case because I would be on medication and wanted someone in a clear head to deal with everything. Neither me or my husband ever got a call during this time.

I started calling their office about a month ago because I had not heard from them since before my surgery. I would always get the receptionist or the voicemail. I even sent emails to the business manager, but do not have an email for the lawyer. Finally I left a message this week saying I was going to drive down to their office (2.5 hours away from where I live) and then I got a call back from business manager.

Basically he told me that my lawsuit was dismissed in the beginning of May on the grounds of not producing documents the other side had requested. He said that there was two hearings that the other side asked for to ask the judge to force my lawyer to give them medical records they requested and my lawyer never gave the records to them, so they asked the judge to dismiss the case and he did. No one ever told me nothing about the case being dismissed until now.

Is this illegal? Who do I contact about this? I am very upset and can't believe that this has happened. I never knew that the lawyers went before the judge about medical records. My lawyer even had all my medical records so they could have been given to the other side easily.

We met with our lawyer on Monday and paid him outright to draft a letter and include documentation of fault (basically the police report, restitution order, court documents, etc.) and also the vet records that include the police check in and vaccine records for the dog. My vet wrote down when the police called him and why they called him and my lawyer's secretary grabbed a copy of that for this. (Why he is including this I don't know but if anyone has any ideas why this would be important let me know...). He did not want to include the bills and orders for the door at this time but took a copy just in case we needed to move further. This morning the student's mom's lawyer who sent the initial letter called our lawyer and said that the family would no longer be pursuing restitution for medical expenses and that we could expect a letter from him stating that would arrive at both the lawyers office and our house within the week. 

Turns out that those of you who guessed that the student didn't tell his mom why and how he got bitten by our dog are probably correct. It wasn't explicitly said during the phone call but my lawyer relayed that he could infer it from the way the conversation with the other lawyer went. This probably made his top ten stupid cases list.

I laughed that off as it sounded absurd but apparently she is being serious. The role that I play I think is the role of older sibling (which I am!) with an absent father, that’s all.

I was told by my sister that she has overheard their mother talking to her aunt that her lawyer is going to sue me. It could be the mom playing games, saying that for my sister to hear and then tell me to scare me into paying her money. She’s capable of being manipulative.

Assuming she is being serious in her attempts to take legal action to get child support from me, what should I expect? And how do I prepare myself now?",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6u3s5f/ca_sisters_mom_wants_to_sue_me_for_child_support/,legaladvice,3095,375,
fakepriest1,2017-08-15 17:58:38+00:00,"Divorcing, turns out we were never legally married, husband says I don't have rights to our property OR our kids (PA)","Last week I asked my husband for a divorce. He countered by announcing that we were never actually married in the first place. We were married in 2007 by his family priest, who is a close friend of his mother's. I never questioned the credentials of the priest because why would I? 

Turns out that the priest was fully defrocked shortly before our marriage, for reasons no one will share with me. My husband says that at the time he was appealing the loss of his priesthood, but ""it didn't stick"". He (my husband) seems to have known the whole time that our marriage wasn't legal, looking at it as a potential out just in case, but he won't confirm this either way (I'm guessing if he did know it was some kind of fraud). My mother in law tearfully confirmed the situation, saying she didn't think it was a big deal at the time because she assumed the appeal would go through. I don't have any reason to doubt her about any of this. 

My husband is now saying that because we aren't really married, I don't have any equity in our house or rights to our things. Worst of all, since he insisted on getting paternity tests on our kids (7 & 4) as infants, HE has parental rights, but not me, since there isn't any proof that I'm their mom. Obviously I'm on their birth certificate but he says that doesn't mean anything because he has DNA proof and I don't. I don't *really* believe this, but I know that unmarried parents don't necessarily have rights without going through the courts so I wanted to check. 

My husband says that he's consulted with a lawyer and that this is just like a ""regular breakup"". He's given me 30 days notice to leave our house since he owned it outright before our ""marriage""/union/whatever. Obviously I have an appointment with my own attorney on Friday, but my head is going to be going a million miles an hour till then so I guess I'm just looking for some...info? Confirmation of his bluffs? Anything would be appreciated.

dogbitethrowaway123,2017-08-12 22:48:43+00:00,"Dog bit home intruder, intruder's mother threatening to sue for medical costs","Throwaway for obv reasons but I live in an older home a stones throw away from frat row in a party school college town. Just over a year ago a college student drunkenly entered my home via throwing his weight at my 150 year old wooden door at around 1:00 AM. When he entered he woke us up, and startled our large dog who was most likely sleeping on the floor by the front door. The dog bit him, drew blood, and college student needed stitches. 

When we heard him entering the home we called the police, who did a great job of coming quickly. They administered medical care to him and one set of officers took him to the ER while another set got a statement from us, we pulled our vaccine records for the dog, gave him the name to the vet, and so on. The next day they called to let us know that they had checked with the vet and everything about our dog was ship shape and the dog was obviously contained appropriately and has no bite record so they didn't impound him or anything and chalked it up to ""doggie justice."" 

They dealt with the student, too, and communicated with us throughout the process and after all the court dates he received a fine and a misdemeanor. We did not attempt to escalate, as college student was drunk, was stupid, had no prior record and hopefully learned from the experience (and our dog). Door and frame got replaced (and strengthened with another lock - we had no idea how brittle that door was!) 

This week, over a year later, we got a letter from a lawyer representing the student and his mom saying we can settle for the cost of the dog bite expenses (which they did not itemize or send a copy of the bill for or anything, just put the number on a letter) or they will sue us for the cost + legal fees. My husband and I can't see how this can possibly hold up in court considering he was technically breaking and entering and did receive a misdemeanor for that. 

My question is...do we even need a lawyer for this? Or can we just say ""see you in court!"" and represent ourselves with a copy of the police report from the break + enter? We're sort of regretting letting it go so easily now. Ugh. How can he possibly sue us for the cost of the stitches and ER bill when he was criminally trespassing in our house and breaking our door down? It's not like our dog was outside running around unsupervised or even on a leash or something. He's not an aggressive dog at all and had never before and never since bit anyone. I feel like he and his mom watched one of those ambulance chasing lawyer commercials and took the bait. 

Edit: I'm hesitant to say where I live because it becomes way too easy to google if I do.

Edit2: Woah! There's a lot of responses! Thanks for the advice everyone! At this point we've made up our minds to speak to the lawyer we had from the initial case last year. We'll call him on Monday and update after that conversation. 

Some answers to questions:
 * We are the homeowners.
 * We paid out of pocket for the replacement door and door frame, and we also replaced our side and rear doors and frames with matching doors when we realized how easy it was to get into our house by forcing the door. This was in the low five figures - we took it out of our emergency fund and did not go through homeowners. There was a restitution order but it was not enough to cover the doors that we wanted, labor, and door frames (we live in a historic home and wanted to keep with the character). We have lived in a historic home for most of our marriage so we know to keep cash on hand for pipe leaks, furnaces going out, and now...door replacements. 
 * We tell our dog he's a good boy every day, don't you worry! He is the goodest boy!

Edit 3: I can't figure out how to get those asterisks to look like bullet points! What am I doing wrong??

Iwantmybathroomback,2017-08-09 15:25:46+00:00,**Update** Landlord gave other tenants a key to my private bathroom,"Just wanted to give everyone a final update about the bathroom situation. The original thread is here: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6r9v8t/landlord_gave_other_tenants_a_key_to_my_private/


Plumbers were here all day on Saturday and the plumbing issue has been fixed. The other tenants are now back to using their restrooms and they've returned their keys. I spoke with a housing representative from the Legal Aid Society who called me on Monday to discuss the issue. She reviewed the lease with me and basically went over each duty that that the landlord had breached, confirming that what he did was absolutely illegal. She also pointed me to additional contacts if further action was needed like breaking the lease or a lawsuit. 


The landlord finally called me on Tuesday after ignoring me for a week. I told him again that I was very angry that other tenants were allowed access to my bathroom without him even asking or notifying me and I referenced the lease several times. He again tried to argue the whole issue about the other tenants not having a bathroom and them possibly suing him and tried to be dismissive of my concerns. I mentioned at that point that I had contacted the Legal Aid Society and had spoken to a housing representative through them and listed every duty that he breached. I also advised him that I had personal belongings in the bathroom closet that could have been stolen and that even though to him it was just a bathroom, it was the equivalent of giving other people unauthorized access to my apartment. Since I also pay for the electricity I told him how lights had been left on, running up my bill. He seemed to be a bit more attentive after that. At the end of it all, he agreed to refund me half of the August rent (which I did obtain in writing) and a promise that this will never happen again. 


All in all I'm happy to be getting half the rent back as that's no small change to me and glad that it didn't come down to having to take some type of legal action, but I'm still highly concerned with his nonchalant attitude and how all of this was handled. He basically ignored me for a week while all of this was going on. I don't have any confidence in him as a landlord. It's a huge and sometimes dangerous city and my closest family is 4 hours away, so feeling safe and happy in my home is super important. I don't really feel that way any longer. My lease is up at the end of October so I've decided moving is probably best. 

TL:DR: The plumbing issue has been fixed and I'm getting a refund on half of my August rent!

Cat_Beans,2017-08-09 06:00:19+00:00,Update - Washington State: Neighbor is currently video recording me and has a camera directly pointed at my bedroom window. What can I do?,"[Previous Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5r4lco/washington_state_neighbor_is_currently_video/)

So a ton has happened since I last posted. I had mentioned in the comments that my neighbor had been basically using sound terrorism to harass us. I began a writing in a log of each event that occurred, with the time, the date, the description, if I called the police (I did for almost every one), and it began to show an alarming pattern—he was playing sounds at random times of the night every single night. After each major event of sounds, I would drop off a written statement to my local police station for the code enforcement officer. The city was now looking at charging him for noise violations based on my complaints.

I took my three page log and copies of seven signed statements and finally had enough of the police taking their time to work on the case against my neighbor. I dropped $95 on paperwork to begin an anti-harassment order against my neighbor. I made sure to explicitly mention the camera pointed in my bedroom window and the ongoing noises.

He was served the temporary order that very day by the local police, and sure enough, the noises ramped up. Before our court date to discuss the anti-harassment order, we were subpoenaed to be witnesses for the noise violation. We also brought the former owner of the home as well as the person who lived on the other side of my neighbor as witnesses to his noise-making capabilities. My neighbor never showed to the court date, and at that point had $1,250 pending in tickets. His lawyer showed up an hour late and the judge graciously accepted his plea to move the date a month forward. Disappointment.

Then the date for the anti-harassment order came. Once again, my neighbor didn't show and his lawyer begged for more time to look over the case. The judge was just and said that everyone has a right to defend their first amendment rights, so he moved the court date for a month later as well. Disappointment number two.

The noises are continuing on the regular at this point and we are trying to record them as best as we can on our phones. It was really hard to do because the noises were short, and happened at random in the middle of the night.

The date for the second anti-harassment hearing arrived and finally, we saw our neighbor come through the courtroom and sit in the back. When it was our turn to explain the situation, we made sure to present our call log, our statements, and videos that we had as evidence against our neighbor. Our neighbor's lawyer tried to get us to give up the call log because he mentioned he was not aware of it before our court date. The judge basically told the lawyer to go fuck himself. The lawyer's only defense for my neighbor was that he worked long hours and couldn't possibly be awake in the middle of the night to terrorize us, and that conversely, WE were the ones making the noises. We then brought up the fact that our neighbor had a security camera pointed directly at our home, and he should have plenty of evidence to prove we were indeed the noisemakers. The judge very confidently approved our anti-harassment order stating no more noises, no more cameras in our windows or at us in general, and our neighbor is not allowed within 25 feet of us. He immediately moved the camera pointing in our bedroom window to being completely flush with the side of the house. Awesome!

This was great news. We finally achieved some peace! And then the date for the noise violation trial came. Just his lawyer showed up, and made a deal with the city lawyer that one ticket would be paid, in exchange for no appeal to our anti-harassment order and to throw out two tickets. It sucked, but they took the deal. Whatever.

And all seemed well.

Then, about a month after the anti-harassment order kicked in, the noises began, again. And the camera began to slowly point into our garage, back in the direction toward the bedroom window.

This time, the police noticed something more alarming.

A red light was going off in the tinted window directly below the camera on the outside of my neighbor's house. They shone their flashlight and spotted a lens. My neighbor had a camera inside his window pointed at my bedroom window the ENTIRE TIME the order was in place, and long before that.

The officers told us to stay quiet, don't be alarmed, but they now were actively seeking a search warrant for the property to seize any noise making equipment and to take down the cameras, as he had broken the order.

The next weekend, my neighbor was arrested and we got to sit outside on the front porch while they disassembled the cameras and seized speaker after speaker, megaphones, etc. from my neighbor's home. They said he had four foot of insulation surrounding the room with the camera, and the front door of the home was completely barred shut.

Unfortunately, they just seized the equipment and will eventually give it back. My neighbor was out of jail the next day, and since they didn't have a search warrant for his hard drives, they couldn't place any voyeurism charges, despite my insistence. They even mentioned they saw me and my husband on a laptop of his.

I'm just happy that the noises have stopped and as far as I know, no more hidden cameras. I'm just glad I could update this crazy situation for you guys. I'm sure I'm not out of the woods yet.

TL;DR: got an anti-harassment order and cameras were supposed to come down, neighbor was a creep and had a hidden camera for a month while the order was in place, probably longer. He got arrested and no more cameras.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6sjjwt/update_washington_state_neighbor_is_currently/,legaladvice,5986,1,
NoNiceGuy,2017-08-08 16:13:51+00:00,"TSA denied me from flying back home to Austin, TX from NYC because of my broken ankle. Now stranded in NYC!","I broke my ankle a couple months back, and had ankle surgery shortly after to have a plate and two screws put in my ankle. I'm in a hard cast for about two more weeks. My girlfriend and I had purchased round trip tickets to vacation in NYC about 5 months prior, so I bought a knee scooter and we decided to go ahead and go on the trip. We flew out of Austin this last Wednesday without any issues. TSA pulled me to the side and gave me a pat down, and wanded my body and ankle, swabbed hands for bomb dust. Everything was cleared except my ankle. The wand kept beeping when it reached the area where my metal plate and screws were located. TSA agents called their supervisor to ask if I could pass through. This took about 10 minutes and I was reassured I would be flying to NYC that day. They eventually got word from the higher up that I was cleared. Woohoo 5 days in NYC. Tons of money spent. Skip to Sunday when we are trying to fly out. Have full confidence I'll be able to pass through. The same procedure begins as I'm going through JFK airport security except this time they can't decide to let me through or not. TSA just keeps calling more and more people over to the scene. Like 5 port authority police officers, a bomb specialist, more higher up supervisors. We sat there for 1 hr and 30mins. I explained to them at least 20 times that I'd broken my ankle and received metal on the side the wand was alarming on. They sat there just staring at each other. Like deer in headlights. They tell me they don't know what to do since they can't actually see what's inside my cast. Everyone including the bomb specialist tell me they'd let me though but the decision comes down to the TSA agents. My gf showed them pictures of my X-rays and of me in the hospital after surgery and showed them our tickets from Austin to NYC that we used. Eventually some stone faced supervisor approached me and said he had to escort me out and was denying me my flight out. Que freak out. My gf is crying. They basically told us we were on our own for getting back home. They said we could rent a car, take train or a bus. I can't drive right now so that's out. My gf would have to drive the entire way (1 day, 8 hours). All last minute trains were nearly $900 dollars for two people and take around 50 hrs to get home. We finally had to decide on greyhound which cost me 400 for the two of us and will take around 38 hours to get home. So here I am typing this out on my phone on this unnecessarily long journey home. TSA said I shouldn't have been allowed to fly out of Austin. This would have been totally different if I'd been denied back home. I could have had my tickets moved by Delta. This has been a huge inconvenience on my GF and I. My gf decided to stay with me to help me get around, but is having to miss work now. Any advice would be helpful. I just feel this would have been avoided if TSA had their act together and had a uniform policy for situations like mine. This could prevent many people from being stranded thousands of miles from home.

myexisanasshole,2017-08-03 21:52:28+00:00,[ME / CA] My teenage daughter was sexually assaulted while visiting her father for the summer.,"Hi everyone, thank you in advance for any help you can provide.

My ex and I divorced ten years ago, we have a 14 year old daughter and joint custody, though she spends the school year in SoCal with me, and the summer in Maine with her father. Our divorce was not amicable, but I do everything in my power to keep it from affecting our daughter, and have not told her about my reasons for wanting a divorce, out of an interest of not poisoning her relationship with her father.

She arrived home this morning, and she looked pale, and was shaking and in tears. After asking her what was wrong, she handed me a letter from my ex's mother. Apparently, my daughter was ""acting like a slut"" and ""dressing inappropriately"" in front of her cousins, and her 19 year old cousin sexually assaulted her. The letter was telling *me* how I'm supposed to change how I'm raising my daughter, to prevent ""promiscuity"". She's always been a crazy bible-thumping weirdo, so I ignored it.

I took my daughter home, and immediately called my ex, asking him to send me the forms so that I can have copies of her medical records from being sent to the hospital sent to her doctor, and ask for the name and number of whichever police officer is handling her case. He informed me that he decided not to press charges, because ""[Our daughter] was being a slut and she needs to know she's not going to be rewarded with attention for that kind of behavior.""

I'm livid. It's been four weeks since the event happened, and they didn't permit her to call me that whole time. I wish I had given her the cell phone I had waiting at home before she left, but I'd intended it as a ""you're starting high school"" gift, and thought it best to wait.

I want to press charges, and see the aggressor punished to the fullest extent of the law. I would also like to see about amending our custody agreement so that she doesn't ever have to go see that fucked up side of her family again. I'm so angry right now I cannot think straight, and she's taking a nap. What do I need to do?

SchoolBans,2017-08-02 22:05:48+00:00,[Texas] School sent a letter that our atheist student club will not be permitted this school year. Invited us to join Christian clubs instead.,"I'm 16 years old. In the last couple of years me and a friend founded an atheist student club in our school to provide a non-religious alternative to the Christian clubs that already existed. Last year we had 22 members. We are the only specifically non-religious club. This is a public school.

The letter says that the club is banned from the school in the coming school year due to the complaints from the parents that the club is encouraging lifestyle that they find unacceptable for their children. We do not bully or troll people. We just do what other clubs do without being religious. We accept all people and have no condition on atheism. Last year we had a Muslim and a Pagan student and everyone loves it.

The complaints are from the parents who don't like that their kids are not as religious as they are. We had a few members whose parents were very religious but they were not. Last year they complained but school took our side. I guess this year they gave in.

I went to the school today and talked to the assistant principal who said that they can't ignore complaints from parents and told me to forget about this.

I'm not a lawyer but doesn't the first amendment protect our right to freedom of and from religion? I don't think they can just say they can ban us because some parents don't like the atheist lifestyle.

First is the law on our side? And if so what resources I can use to fight the school's decision? My parents will not pay for a lawyer. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6r7qmb/texas_school_sent_a_letter_that_our_atheist/,legaladvice,4285,269,

Ultimately, my broker was able to negotiate a deal with one landlord to get an apartment that I love, but to make certain I paid on time, the landlord requested that I pay first and last month, plus the deposit up front (I paid my broker's fee in BTC) and then give him 22 checks, each dated for the month they were to be used.

Fortunately, I had just over $80k in my account so the checks didn't bounce, but I was planning to use most of that money to pay a vendor. I'm now going to have to liquidate more BTC, which I was trying to avoid doing right after the split.

About two weeks ago, I had an Amazon package riffled through. It was an IPL laser for in home hair removal, the guy stole a cartridge. I thought nothing of it and thought that Amazon messed up or the package was delivered incorrectly until my neighbor indicated the man, whom my neighbor saw, was going through my stuff and waiting out in the parking lot 8 hours later, gave up, and went somewhere else.  I got home shortly after that time.  The cops really were whatever about it. Amazon replaced the part.  I dusted off my gun.  Life went on.

About four days ago, I found a box of razor blades and rope in front of my door.  I thought nothing of it, eh people are moving so whatever, and I moved on.

The bin was perfectly inverted and in a different location in the room.  The food stays in the bag, as I like to keep crumbs out of the container, and I usually fold it down, it was rolled down.  This is not something I do.  I also don't invert the food tub and as it was perfectly inverted, I doubt it was a cat that did it.  I don't go in that room except to clean the litter box and feed the cats.

My landlord nor has the management stepped foot in my apartment. There is no sign of entry.  My spare key is still in my kitchen.

Am I crazy or does this sound like something I should chat with the cops about?  This feels weird.  


EDIT: So, I am going to have the locks changed, get a CO detector, and a camera system.  I likely will drop by to talk to the PD if the CO detector shows no CO as I do want to report this activity.

My dad is being sued so I was hoping that someone would be able to point me in the right direction regarding legal council/other issues. We live in Ohio.

Some backstory: 
My dad had an unwritten contract with a friend(let's call him ""Mitch"") that allowed Mitch to farm his land in exchange for compensation in the form of a portion of whatever the farmed crops were sold for. Anyways, in the summer of 2016, Mitch abandoned the crops because his wife divorced him and he went bankrupt, so the crops sat in the field and died. Well, my dad received an invoice from the guy Mitch bought his seeds from. Mitch never paid for the seeds. The invoice does not have my father's name on it, nor is there any connection between Mitch's farming venture and my dad's land beyond spoken agreements. My dad told the seed supplier that he was not the one that bought the seeds and refused to pay the invoice.

The issue at hand: 
My dad recently received another invoice from the seed supplier that is a carbon copy of the previous invoice save for them scribbling my dad's name onto the agreement. My dad once again refused to pay the invoice. Now the seed supplier is suing us for the cost of the seed. We have copies of both invoices.

My questions:

1. What type of lawyer would be best to combat the lawsuit? 
2. Could there be a case to be made for my father being responsible for the cost of the seed that immediately comes to mind?


I know that there is a lot there to read, but I appreciate anyone who read through it with the intention of answering one of my concerns. Please let me know if you need more details. Thank you.



Edit: Thank you to everyone that responded. This blew up more than I thought it would, so I guess I wasn't prepared to come home to so many comments. Sorry if I missed your's. I will read through all of them tomorrow when I have a clearer head.

TheElderGodsSmile,2017-07-31 19:09:16+00:00,What is the legal definition of a sandwich?,"Certain unscrupulous individuals that I am aquatinted with have recently asserted that in some jurisdictions (namely New York)  Burritos are Sandwiches. 

This is clearly a scurrilous lie.

Thus I ask you good people of Reddit, what is the legal definition of a Sandwich?

I have provided this [handy chart](http://imgur.com/5yzsKJ5) for reference purposes.

Edit: at the request of /u/foxhunter I am changing the location to Tennessee. It's a race for gold people.

Edit 2:

Full definition given by /u/JustSomeBadAdvice

Here is an attempt at a definition that includes all things commonly referred to or thought of as ""a sandwich"" and excludes all things not commonly thought of as sandwiches.

First two definitions to help:

 • Bread: A ""bread"" in this parlance refers to any grain-based dough that has been baked either by itself or with other ingredients added to it that do not constitute the sandwich ""filling.""

 • Filling: Any ingredient or ingredients normally eaten by human beings that is used to differentiate between ""two pieces of bread"" and a sandwich.

** Bread may be made of corn instead of grain if corn is merely substituted for grain using a grain-based dough receipe.

And now the definition:

 1. A sandwich is a single piece of bread or two pieces of bread(of roughly equal size) that and surrounds a filling on both the top and bottom as it is eaten, where the bottom of the sandwich is gripped by thumb(s) and the top is gripped by finger(s).

 2. The bread must have been baked prior to being combined with the filling(i.e., no Calzones)

 3. Where the sandwich is one (rather than two) pieces of bread, the filling must be typically found in two-bread sandwiches in the same form. (I.e., no burritos)

 4. Where substituted as a low-carb option, lettuce can be substituted for bread provided nothing else is changed and filling is the same as is typically found in two-bread sandwiches.

Things included in definition:

 1. Grilled Cheese Sandwiches

 2. PB&amp;J sandwiches

 3. Submarine sandwiches

 4. Ice cream sandwiches

 5. Meat, cheese, and cracker sandwich

 6. Wraps, flatbread sandwiches, pita wraps, and gyro's (when eaten as one).

 7. Hotdogs when consumed by turning them on their side and eaten as a sandwich.

 8. Melts and Panini's

 9. Chicken salad sandwiches and tuna sandwiches.

 10. BLT sandwiches.

 11. Lettuce wraps aka unwiches when folded and eaten as sandwiches.

 12. Sloppy Joe's

 13. Quesadilla's if eaten as a sandwich.

 14. Oreo cookies and other sandwich cookies, if the cookies were baked prior to joining the filling

Things not included in definition:

 1. Tacos(how eaten)

 2. Burritos (Rule #3)

 3. Calzones (prior baking)

 4. Poptarts (prior baking)

 5. Salads (improper bread).

 6. Ravioli (Prior baking, how eaten)

 7. Chicken wings(fucking colorado) and fried foods. (how eaten, one or two pieces of bread)

 8. Pizza (bread surrounding, how eaten, prior baking)

 9. The double down is not a sandwich. It is the shame of the U.S. (And the pride of 'Murica).

 10. Burger bowls &amp; taco salads. (how eaten)

 11. Stuffed Grape Leaves(rule 4)

 12. Chili in a bread bowl(how eaten)

 13. Dumplings(prior baking)

 14. Uncrustables(prior baking)

 15. Pigs in a blanket(prior baking)

I have no idea who created the term ""open faced sandwich"" but it is an abomination. It is either ""X on Y"" or ""X and Y"" ala Bagel &amp; Cream Cheese or Buttered Toast or eggs on toast.

I was unable to exclude quesadillas without also excluding other things that are functionally identical to sandwiches(Wraps/grilled cheese), and I was unable to include uncrustables without also including calzones.

I have the most current NY state license which has got to be near impossible to fake. I went to buy liquor at the liquor store the other day and the cashier insisted that my license was fake. He gave it to the manager who also insisted that it was fake and then refused to give it back to me. He said I can either leave immediately or he will call the cops. I told him to call the cops because my ID was real. I had to wait over 2 hours for the police to arrive and confirm that my ID was in fact real. I probably should've asked the cop but it didn't cross my mind until later, but in the state of Massachusetts is it legal for him to confiscate my license and refuse to return it to me?

(Update)","I guess it's time for me to post an update to [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5pbvb7/new_york_girlfriend_is_pregnant_i_want_the_baby/) post. I don't have a happy update however. So much has happened.

On the advice of this sub I went to a lawyer and did all the necessary paperwork. My girlfriend changed her mind a few times between wanting to raise the baby with me and wanting adoption but in the final weeks of the pregnancy she told me that I'm not the father at all. I thought she was lying so I asked to do a test. We went and did one of the prebirth blood tests and the result was negative. She was telling the truth. I wasn't the father.

I broke up with her her then. I was so heartbroken. She had cheated on me and made me think I was going to be a father for months. I was curious about who the father was though. I asked her and she told me that it's the man who is going to adopt the child from her! Yes. This man fucked my girlfriend and now wants to adopt his own baby from my girlfriend with his wife who had no idea.

I thought his wife deserves to know so I went to their house (when he wasn't home) and told his wife everything. She had a complete breakdown in front of me. I felt sad that I caused this but I imagine it was her husband who cheated on her that really caused it. She called my now ex girlfriend to get confirmation and she told her the truth then called her husband and that was when I left.

Now the baby is born and I've heard that my ex girlfriend and the man have moved in together in an apartment and are raising the baby! I guess his wife will divorce him soon.

It will take me years to recover from this. I thank you for your advice and help. It's sad that things turned out this way and I hope this baby grows up to be a decent person despite being raised by two cheaters.

Wheredoigogo,2017-07-30 04:21:01+00:00,Got home from long trip to new tenants in apartment - MA,"I'm sorry if this is short, they have my computer so I'm using my phone. 

I went on a month and a half trip, starting mid June. I told my landlord about this in writing (email) and gave them permission to enter the apartment to do minor repairs. My lease is until mid September and I absolutely made no mention of moving out. I'm paid out through mid next month and supposedly the last month is already covered as I paid it up front with my deposit. 

I arrived at my apartment (a studio in a small building) a bit over three hours ago to find the chain on the door preventing me from opening it even though my key worked. Almost immediately I heard screaming from the people inside since they thought I was breaking in. I said that it's my apartment which they denied... even though I could see my pc and they were drinking out of my cups. They claimed that they rented the apartment as fully furnished and that I needed to fuck off since it and its contents are theirs fair and square. I pointed out the computer only to find that they had basically trashed it since they couldn't unlock it. It's a custom built machine and definitely is (or was) my most valuable possession, I don't understand why they could possibly think it would be included as a furnishing. I also had tons of clothes in the closet and drawer (assumed trashed now) and the sheets on the bed are mine. I know this, it's a factory defect set I got on sale so the chances of them having their own is next to none. 

I called the police who showed up surprisingly quickly, but the other people have a lease and recent mail for the address. I have no idea what they've been doing with my mail since the locked box was emptied.

Since we both have leases the police couldn't do anything tonight. I'm in a hotel. I'm not sure what the hell I can do. I'm concerned that now this is happening they'll sell off my stuff or otherwise be spiteful. Lots of the kitchenware are family heirlooms and can't be replaced, they have what's left of my pc, and all my furniture. I'm assuming the clothes and me-specific stuff is long gone already. I tried to grab some photos to show that they have my stuff but they shut the door when they saw so I only managed a couple blurry pics. 

I can't get a hold of my landlord and my new place isn't available for another month and a half. Since these people have been there for a month I'm scared that they have to be formally evicted and I'll have nowhere to live for the next few weeks. All my stuff is basically gone, especially if they try to get rid of the unique things. All I have is the small amount of clothing I had for my trip. 

**Edit 1:** Oh wow, thank you all for the advice! I was in full blown panic last night so I'm sorry I couldn't respond quickly. I'll try to answer questions here so everyone doesn't have to search! I apologize if anything is disjointed, I'm trying to cover as much as possible.

I still can't contact my landlord but I left messages both last night and this morning. A case has been opened with my insurance but they said not much can be done immediately because it's Sunday. I'm waiting on hearing from them before reaching out to a lawyer myself. I'm about to try the organizations suggested, hopefully they can help even more with specific information since I can't post everything here without being identified!

I do have a copy of the lease, it was all done online. I don't have the printed version though, it was in the apartment. When I moved in I paid 4x one month's rent: first month, last month, security deposit, and broker fee. I've always paid within a couple hours of rent being posted (it's an online system for all this landlord's property units) and have never missed any utilities, I know for sure this isn't from lack of payment. I had my passport with me since I was traveling outside the country so that's good! 

The landlord responded to my email, they definitely received it and acknowledged the trip. I did get home early though, as someone mentioned. By about two weeks, it was originally a two month trip. Maybe they were renting the apartment as a really short term sublet and hoping I wouldn't find out? I'm a little hopeful that they might have put my clothing in storage if so...

I'm in a neighborhood of Boston, one of the more popular ones for students. People do sublet pretty often, after reading some of these comments maybe it isn't as weird to have so much of my stuff after all. 

One thing did come up while checking out apartment details was that my electricity was off. I have autopay so I didn't even see the bill amount from last week, but if I had paid manually I (hopefully) would have noticed that my apartment was somehow using more power than usual. The only thing that should have been running was the fridge, everything else was entirely unplugged! The wifi is also still in my name and the password was on a sticky note. I imagine the new residents were told that the landlord was covering all utilities so that may also not be their fault. Same goes for the mail, they could have just thought it was a wrong address. 

I guess what I'm thinking is maybe the new residents are just as much the victims here. Their aggressive reaction could easily just be the stress of having a stranger try to get in the apartment and then call the cops. That'd make me defensive! 

I do have a possibly stupid follow up question. I'm spending the day making a list of the items I had in the apartment. Unfortunately my receipt box was in the unit so that doesn't help, thankfully most of my computer's parts were ordered online so I have that. The main question is, when deciding value does custom tailoring come into play at all? This morning I remembered that my bridesmaid dress for an upcoming wedding was in the closet. The dress itself is only a few hundred dollars (expensive but not crazy for weddings!) but it had a ton of custom work for sizing and neck line modifications. It'll be a pain to replace if I even can in time. Would it be worthwhile to try and contact the current residents to see if they kept any clothing? Or would that hurt my case? 

Also, is it better to stay in a hotel while this is getting sorted out? I'm staying with a friend right now (didn't want to bother her so late last night) but again, I'm not sure if hotels are better because of the paper trail. 

Not much has happened, tomorrow should have more progress!",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6qfhq4/got_home_from_long_trip_to_new_tenants_in/,legaladvice,3222,340,
halhakeem,2017-07-29 13:27:36+00:00,My boyfriend persuaded me to have a baby but now refuses to support it.,"Hello. I am from Mississippi. My boyfriend and I have been together for two years. We always used birth control. A few months ago, we were fooling around, and, out of the blue, my boyfriend suggested we try to have a baby. I was perplexed because he had always expressed disinterest in children. He started fantasizing about a wonderful family we could have, emphasizing his love and commitment to me. I was so taken aback and, after a few hours, he eventually persuaded me. I probably asked him a hundred times if he was sure, each of which he replied in the affirmative.

Well after a short while, he changed his tune and told me to go back on the pill. I was again confused but obliged. Shortly afterward, I found out I was pregnant. I felt a rush of emotions – fear, anxiety, and, surprisingly, joy. I thought it was nice to have a little person growing inside of me, depending on me for support. But I was mostly worried about how my boyfriend would feel. That night, I gradually broached the subject and eventually told him. 

He hit the roof and accused me of plotting against him. I reminded him that he persuaded me to try for a baby, and he said that was just stupid pillow talk. He ordered me to “get rid of it,” to which I felt sick. He has known from the very beginning of our relationship that I am terrified by even the thought of abortion, and he always said he felt the same way. I tried to placate and reason with him, but he just kept calling me a lying slut and a bitch. He snapped that I would never get a cent of his money and stormed out. 

I was completely flummoxed and scared. I know several single mothers who were abandoned by their boyfriends/husbands and are struggling immensely to raise their children on their own. I swore I would never end up like them. But I know that I cannot raise a baby on my own. I even started considering abortion, but the closest abortion clinic is over a hundred miles away, and abortion is not covered by insurance in my state. 

Unfortunately, I could not even have a conversation with my boyfriend, as he kicked me out of our apartment and cut off all communication with me. I spent weeks simply trying to talk to him. He eventually relented, just in time to introduce me to his new girlfriend, seated in the passenger seat of his brand new truck. I was devastated. I even gave abortion a second thought but realized I had just passed the 20-week threshold. To top it off, I was fired from my job for unexplained reasons (just days after I put in a request for a larger uniform to accommodate my baby bump).

My boyfriend was the one who coaxed me into going off the pill and making love night after night. He promised me, swore up and down, that he would always be there for the baby and me. And now that we are pregnant, he wants nothing to do with the baby or me. How can he do this? How can a father want nothing to do his own child? Our baby is our creation, and every day, I find myself growing more and more attached to it. When I feel it kicking inside of my stomach, I feel warm and joyful. But I know that I cannot afford to feed and clothe it on my own, and I know that I will not be able to give it up once I hold it in my arms. I really, really do not want to have to go to court, but as my bump grows and my paltry savings diminish, I fear that I may have no other option. I don't care about myself; I just want our baby to have its basic needs met. What can I do?

kshucker,2017-07-28 13:47:51+00:00,"[Pennsylvania] This is incredibly stupid, but my neighbor keeps calling the police because of leaves from my tree","**Per mods request, please keep comments on topic** I truly would like to know what legal rights I have against this.

Hello r/legaladvice. I feel like I'm starting to become a regular on this sub ever since I bought my house. Long story short, my neighbor will call the police if ANY leaves from my tree or ANY grass blades from me cutting my grass go into her yard (yes, she stands out there and watches me cut the grass).

Last week we talked  to one another with a police officers presence so we can try and work something out. Basically, the moment she sees a leaf in her yard, she gets pissed. I told her I'm not home all the time to constantly monitor every single fucking leaf that falls from my tree. Oh, the tree is on the OPPOSITE side of the yard from her. My yard is not littered with leaves and the police even said that my yard looks fine but she persists on calling the police out every time anything comes into her yard.

I have done my research on the situation, as dumb as I think it is, but once a leaf falls from a tree, I'm not liable for what happens to it. That's what internet articles say at least. Could anybody produce any sort of Pennsylvania state legal documentation that says that leaves falling from a tree is not a crime? Lol. I can't believe I am even here asking this but I'm getting really sick of the police coming out for everything I do outside. I just want to present it to the police/neighbor so it stops.

edit: Since this blew up a little bit, and others have asked what I have done to her for her to do what she is doing, I will give a little more information about the past few months. Within a month of moving into the house this past December, I was out back after dark (it was no later than 8pm) breaking down some boxes that we had left over from moving. I took a quick break from breaking them down and I see this hand throwing trash into my yard over the fence that separates our yards. I couldn't believe it. Up until this point, we had one interaction with one another and that was when we were both outside shoveling snow. I introduced myself and she introduced herself and immediately warned me that she likes to call the police on anything that she sees wrong in the neighborhood. Basically bragging about it. From that greeting to the trash being thrown into my yard, no interactions with one another. I bought a security camera system shortly after that to see how often she does it. We had bits and pieces of trash in our backyard shortly after moving in and it was always on the side of the yard that was up against her fence. We just thought that it was whatever trash that the wind picked up and would stop at the fence and we would pick it up whenever we would see it.

Within 3 days of having the cameras, she's doing it again, and is on camera doing it. I waited for it to happen on 3 more occasions. After the 2nd time I had it on video, anytime I saw her outside when I was outside, I tried to say hello and talk to her about it, but as soon as I said hello, she would go inside. After the 3rd time of throwing trash into my yard and being unsuccessful at talking to her about it, I called the police. There was no reason for her to be throwing trash into my yard. The police gave her a warning. The trash in our backyard that we thought was getting blown there stopped as well. Crazy.

After that, I had been nothing but nice to her and would say hello whenever I saw her. I really don't want to have problems, but I had to do something about the trash being thrown into our yard. Anytime I would say hello, I would get ignored... She even went as far as to say she was going to charge me with harassment if I didn't stop... What?

Last week the police came out again for leaves in her yard. He suggested that we talk to one another while he was there to listen. She explained herself. She thinks that we are not maintaining our property well enough and is upset that we aren't outside to pick up every leaf that falls from our tree and doesn't want any grass clippings blowing into her yard. The police officer looked over at my yard and looked back at her and said there is nothing wrong with my yard and that it looks better than a lot of properties in our city. She said that she bought her house that doesn't have a tree because she didn't want to clean up leaves. Newsflash, every house on our block has a tree except for hers. She ""just wishes"" that we would take care of our yard better. Again, the police officer enforced to her that according to city law, our yard was fine.

We agreed with each other that if we have any problems with one another that we would talk to each other first before getting the police involved. 8 days later she called the police again for grass and leaves being in her yard. As far as I could tell, there wasn't any grass left behind. And when I mean in her yard, I'm not saying it is in the middle of her yard. It is mere inches from where our yards meet in her yard.

She has been nothing but a headache since we moved in and it's only getting worse. I have done nothing to her other than make sure that she stopped throwing trash in my yard. Why she started to do that? I don't know.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6q3w5q/pennsylvania_this_is_incredibly_stupid_but_my/,legaladvice,2100,284,
FlappingHands,2017-07-27 23:37:47+00:00,[VA/FEDs] Not allowed to use the bathroom in the office because I am of the wrong gender,"I work as a contractor for the Federal Government in Virginia.  I was recently moved upstairs to a smaller office and joined a crew of about seven other workers (all female).  The office only have one bathroom (single occupancy, unisex) that I used when needed.  I never left a mess and it was always clean after I have used it.  

This afternoon, I was told by the office administrator that the bathroom from now was to be female-only and I could not use it anymore.  One of the female senior staff member had apparently requested it and the office administrator felt forced to comply.  I was told that I was free to use the downstairs male bathroom as often as needed and that I could take my time when doing so. 

Using the downstairs bathroom is pain because I don't have door access anywhere in the building.  I have to take the elevator down, knock on a door and hope somebody is there to let me in, and then use the bathroom.  It's the reverse procedure going back up.  If there nobody else is there, I'm locked out and can't get back into my office.  I can't leave the door open or unlocked as it's a secure office.  So basically, if I work alone in the office then I can't use the bathroom as I can't get back in.

I do feel discriminated against for being a male especially as I am the only one in the office not allowed to use the office bathroom.  I could understand if there was a multi-stall bathroom, but this is a single-occupancy one and there's no real justification to make it female-only instead of unisex.  It was only made so because a senior female staff member does not want to share the bathroom with somebody from the opposite gender.

I would like to know if I have a valid complaint for gender discrimination and what the best course of action would be. Thanks in advance.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6pzz61/vafeds_not_allowed_to_use_the_bathroom_in_the/,legaladvice,2042,253,
stolenpoa,2017-07-27 08:20:37+00:00,[Update] about Ex selling my things using power of attorney,"My original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6p1u7c/ny_ex_has_power_of_attorney_and_is_trying_to_sell/


I was being a bit paranoid when making my original post because I did not want to get condescending responses. I'm a woman in my early thirties and my ex is a man around the same age. It has been a strange few days.


I met with my lawyer Monday morning and she was very supportive. Even though she usually deals with elder abuse she said my situation was very much within her expertise and seemed excited to have me as a client. She was also very angry! After last Saturday I have not had a lot of emotional energy so it was nice to see someone be like that on my behalf.


I spent a while in my lawyer's office and later in the day my ex called me but my lawyer had told me not to talk to him for now so I did not answer. We listened to a message together though and my ex said he was selling things for my benefit and was investing it for me to help with any bills I have to pay. My ex also said they were interested in getting back together since I came back safely from my trip. My lawyer laughed and it was a very surreal moment.


After just a day my lawyer found out that my ex had done something like this before! He had been with a person who was very sick for a while then took off with the contents of a joint account and their car right before they died. The person's estate got into a legal battle with my ex and got the car back but not the money in the end. She thinks this is basically what my ex was doing to me and that they probably did it other times too but was not always sued over it or it was in other states. The whole relationship we had was just fake I guess and he misread the situation when I was leaving to go see specialists, thinking I was probably not coming back. That also explains why he never had a job if he just makes money off people like me.


My lawyer sent a lot of letters out to lots of places on Monday including one to my ex. They were all about revoking the power of attorney I had granted and the one to my ex had a bunch of demands in it telling him to produce my money and belongings as well as copies of the power of attorney and the other documents my ex had about me. She spoke with the realtor and some other people about my house and the unfortunate reality is I should probably let the sale happen and take the money. That is not really what I wanted to hear but it's not the end of the world. She also had me get someone to change the locks on my apartment.


Wednesday was a weird day because my ex showed up at my lawyer's office with some of my stuff. I wasn't there so I don't know exactly what that was like but I do have my computer back! My ex also produced the access codes for online investments made with my money which seems to have pissed off my lawyer because it's going to be a headache making sure I get all my money back. She has dealt with this before and is going to help me recover as much of it as possible. She also says we will almost definitely be going after my ex for money because there are a lot of problems with what he did and the power of attorney itself is very suspect, but she needs to talk to the hospital and some other people first. My lawyer says it's a big deal that the paperwork my ex was using to say I was incapacitated is from when I was hospitalized around the time the power of attorney actually happened.


To sum it all up: Now I have my computers back but my money is in online investments and it may be difficult to get the full value back. It is also likely that the rest of the money from the sale of my house is coming directly to me.

WheresMyCar123,2017-07-25 17:45:15+00:00,"[WA] Major garage chain lost our car keys, car stolen from their lot the following day.","This is a major tire/garage chain in Washington.

Wednesday we dropped our car off in the afternoon to get four new tires, and planned on picking it up the following day since they didn't have time to do the work that afternoon.

Thursday we get the call to come pick the car up.  We show up, pay the $600+, wait for them to bring the keys over, when we see several of them start looking around frantically.  Long story short, we wait an hour for them to tell us they're sorry, but they lost our keys.  They asked if we had a spare, which we did not.  They said they would get a locksmith to come down and create a new key and fob.  I'm a pretty calm guy, and I understand crap happens, so I wasn't too upset and said to please notify us ASAP when the key was ready.

Friday we called them, still working on the key.  I gave them through the weekend (probably too generous).  Monday I called them for an update to be told, ""Oh, we thought you picked it up over the weekend already.""  NOPE.  They reviewed their security tapes, and at 2am on Friday someone hopped right into the car with our key and took off.

Is there anything I should be doing other than letting insurance handle it and filing a police report?  The store manager has been as nice as possible, but it's essentially out of his hands and dealing with corporate now.  I'm upset because they failed us several times over.  Losing our keys was bad enough, but we've found that of the 16 cameras in the store, none of them are aimed at the board where all keys are hung (for anyone to grab).  They also don't have a working camera of the parking lot (only an inside camera looking out through a window, extremely low quality).  They told us that NORMALLY they don't leave cars out in the lot overnight, they typically lock them up in the garage... but since they lost our keys, they ""had no choice"" but to leave it out in the parking lot.  They also lost a house key, and our address is in the glovebox, so we're contacting a locksmith.

Any advice appreciated.  The car was 100% in their possession, so I'm hoping we don't get too shafted here.

EDIT: After some vocal prodding, corporate has refunded our entire $620 new tire bill while they ""continue to investigate.""  No charge back needed.  I assume they know they're screwed.

Today I received a phone call from the school, telling me that they are doing an investigation into a series of very serious incidents that happened last year and they would like to have the password for my son's Facebook account, also asking me to disable two-step verification if his account has it. They also said it would really be a great help if I hand over any phones, tablets or computers that my son has had access to in the last year, removing any passcode or login restriction.

I was shocked about hearing this. I asked about the incident and I was told that they can't tell me since it doesn't directly concern my son, that they only seek this to see if there has been any mention of it in the communications that my son has had with his friends which might help them uncover some information.

I declined. Told them that I'm happy to talk to them about the incident in person if it concerns my son but other than that this is very unreasonable and really none of our business. I was told something along the lines of ""I strongly recommend you to help us. This is a very serious issue for a few other students and to be honest with you refusal will have some consequences, I'm mostly talking about your son's future at the school in the coming school year and but also potentially legally. I really hope you cooperate for all our sake.""

I told her to send us what they want in writing. She said that she hopes we're not trying to make this difficult as ""lives are on the line here"", I insisted that I want it for my records. She said they might do that.

So my question is... WTF? They can't be serious about this. My instinct is to get a lawyer if we received anything in writing but really what I'm wondering about is how far can they go in this so-called ""investigation""? Let's say when school starts, my son takes a phone or iPad to school? Can they confiscate and look through it? Can they force him to reveal the passcode to it or force him to use his fingerprint to unlock?

Massachusetts.,"I posted [earlier](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6n6lrr/phd_student_here_being_accused_of_plagiarism_only/) about a plagiarism situation with the university in my PhD thesis.

To make it short, a few sentences in the thesis was too similar to what I had said in a couple of papers and my masters thesis. This wasn't a direct copy &amp; paste, and  it was 7 sentences (53 words) out of my thesis which was a little over 95,000 words.

Last week I got an automated email that an investigation has been started on the recommendation of the person that I talked to. The email explained that in case scientific misconduct is found, I will have a chance to defend my case to the board and the board will decide what to do, which vary from a simple revision and resubmission to presenting the case to the diciplinary committee for a serious offense.

I asked for appointments with a few people. Head of the department, dean of students, and a head tutor to ask for advice. I haven't managed to see any of them yet.

Today, I received an email that the investigation is over and they have found no evidence of misconduct or plagiarism. They apologized for the stress that this has caused. A little later, I received another email from the head of the committee personally apologizing for this mess, and explaining that the officer who I talked to had gone fishing rather than doing the standard practice which is not the policy.

So that's that. Now I can graduate in peace. I cancelled the appointments and decided not to pursue the potential racism situation as there's no point anymore. Thanks all for advice.

helpmeinCali,2017-07-20 13:53:29+00:00,[California] Ex-boyfriend tattooed an x-rated photo of me on his arm. Is this revenge porn?,"I'll try to make this quick...I'm still trembling. I dated my boyfriend on and off for 2 years and it was a roller coaster relationship. I finally got the courage to leave and not get dragged back in. Once he realized I wasn't going to cave and come back to him this time, things turned even uglier...for a few days. Then radio silence. I could tell shit was going to hit the fan and even played out scenarios in my head of what awful was to come - but I never expected this.

In the beginning of our relationship ex-BF and I took intimate videos. I know, I am utterly stupid. I've been scared of him using this as ""revenge porn"" but because of CA's revenge porn laws, I didn't think he'd go there. He's already on probation and does *not* want to get in more legal trouble, despite him wanting to hurt me. 

I woke up Wednesday morning to a post of his friends showing ex-BF's new tattoo on his upper arm. It's me...with his semen covering my face. It's a still from one of the intimate movies. The tattoo artist is very talented...there's no second guessing that it is my face. I googled around and found a similar tattoo to give you an idea (in the comments). Apparently this is something other people have tattooed and maybe how he got the idea. I'm horrified. Can he really do this? The tattoo is huge...takes up his entire upper arm. It's not like he has a sleeve or anything to distract from it (he has other tattoos but in places like his chest and back). In the photo ex-BF is smiling with a big thumbs up and his friends are sharing it and commented ""LOL"" and hateful things. I can get over his shitty friends, but what if this gets shared a bunch on social media? Will it ever go away if it's on the internet? Also, what about the people he will encounter for the rest of his life seeing this tattoo of me? I'm so horrified, I hate myself right now. 

Is this protected under revenge porn? Can I legally get him to remove it or cover it up? Please help. 

Edit: thank you for all of your replies. Yes, I know that my ex will regret this tattoo and be seen as a trashy MF, however the pain of this embarrassment is still real for me. I don't care what his occupation or future relationships will look like...what I care about is my face on display for whoever sees him, the photo, shares it, reposts it, etc....

For now I am screenshotting and documenting everything. Every share, every person who's liked it, every comment. I'm also documenting all texts between me and my ex and transferring his psycho voicemails to my computer. Any other advice on documentation?

I've reported the images on facebook but have yet to hear back. I've gotten countless PMs and texts from people who are friends, family or acquaintances asking me about the tattoo. I haven't responded to anyone. I'm worried about my co-workers or fellow students seeing this, but until facebook does something, IDK what else there is to do. 

I don't know if I will take legal advice for fear of this becoming a huge court case (I wonder if this is likely, given the traction of revenge porn cases in the media and the fact that this is a very unique situation...which (I can admit) is flabbergasting and makes your mouth drop. I can't imagine a headline involving this that WOULDN'T be clicked on by everyone who reads it. 

I'm going to take some time and cool down...right now I feel like tearing my hair out and I need to think clearly. I'm not going to respond to ANYONE about the tattoo except for a few close friends and family. I don't want anything getting back to my ex. He wants a reaction...he wants me to hurt...he wants me to beg and plead...I won't.

So it is done. We called an abortion clinic in New Mexico and asked for advice. They were very helpful. Scheduled an appointment.

I told my parents that I'm taking my sister to go sightseeing in New Mexico for 2 days. They never suspected anything so they allowed it and didn't need any convincing. So in the morning I picked her up and we drove to New Mexico. We took a few pictures here and there to show later in case someone asked. Had the appointment and the procedure done in the afternoon. Spent the night at a hotel and drove back to my place the next day. She spent the day and that night at my place. I called my mom at about 11pm and told her that we arrived 15 minutes ago and she's already fallen asleep so I'll bring her there tomorrow.

She was feeling fine by then. So nothing suspicious at all. She's very happy this worked out the way it did and I'm happy that she's happy. I told her that she should not tell anyone about this until at least she is an adult and 100% independent from our parents. You can't really be sure who you can trust so better keep it a secret.

Thank you for your advice and the peace of mind that you gave us. Once we knew I won't be in legal trouble, we were relaxed and it was easy to arrange everything else. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6obrob/little_sister_16_needs_an_abortion_texas_wants/,legaladvice,29399,2,

[Original thread here](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6kjnd3/wi_falsely_accused_of_stalking_someone_i_havent/)

Apparently, the initial email was legitimate. As in, apparently, this former classmate of mine who I haven't contacted since the end of finals and with whom, on the few occasions I've communicated with them, I only talked about class or school related things appears to actually believe I am stalking her.

I found this out via an email from someone at the Division of Student Life at my university (I verified with the office, whose number I got online, that this was actually from them) telling me that they have issued a ""no contact directive"" on me, saying I'll be punished if I have ""non-incidental contact"" with her. Granted, not contacting her isn't an issue since not contacting her is exactly what I've been doing, but if she continues to falsely believe I am contacting her, I will be accused of violating this directive. The letter closes by saying that the letter was also forwarded to campus police.

I called the person at student life who sent the letter,  calmly told them about how surprised I am to have gotten this letter, since I haven't contacted her since the end of finals and that when we interacted our conversations were class or school related.

After I gave some basic information and stated my willingness say what I've said under oath or supply the emails in which we've corresponded and any other evidence to help show that the accusation against me is false, the person asked me two questions:

- Have I been to the campus of [public university in a neighboring state] this past spring or this summer? 
(No, I haven't been to that state since I was a little kid and I don't know anyone, other than apparently her, who has been in that state recently)

- Have I, this past spring or summer, gone by [first name I have never gone by] or [alternative version I have never gone by of a first name I have never gone by]?
(No, I haven't)

I was told that there is not an active investigation going on at this point, but that there could be one in the near future and that if such an investigation begins, I will be notified.

What the fucking heck am I supposed to do here? What could possibly be going on? Any advice is appreciated.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6o40zf/update_falsely_accused_of_stalking_someone_i/,legaladvice,1381,149,

in June 2012, my bank account was deposited with $50,000 (give or take a few hundred) that I knew nothing about. I called the bank, and was told that they'll investigate it and it's best if I'm not touching the money. A few weeks passed, nothing happened. I called again after 1 month, again was told that there's an ongoing investigation.

After 3 months, I called again, and was told that they know nothing about this and the money is mine. I explained everything, they opened a new investigation and once again, nothing happened.

After 1 year, I went into the bank to discuss this. They promised that they will get to the bottom of this. I called again after a month, and was told that they have no idea what I'm talking about and there's no record of any recent investigation.

Now it's been over 5 years and the money is there. At what point can I call this money mine and move on from it? I mean, I know 50K doesn't just appear out of thin air and there's always a chance that someone will come after it at some point. What is my best course of action regarding this issue?

Tuilampo,2017-07-16 12:34:58+00:00,[Update] Girlfriend (now ex) is pregnant and wants to give up for adoption. I don't. What are my rights? (Texas),"[This is my first post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5gexji/girlfriend_now_ex_is_pregnant_and_wants_to_give/?utm_content=title&amp;utm_medium=front&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=legaladvice) 

Short version: I'm sitting here and my baby daughter is right here next to me, taking a nap!

Long version:

If you remember, I asked about how I should go about stopping my then-pregnant ex from leaving the baby for adoption. I listened to the suggestions. Got a lawyer. Put myself on the registry as well.

She really wanted to fight me over this right until the last month of the pregnancy. I was fully ready to fight her legally to get my rights as the father. But in the final month she changed her mind and decided that give me full custody instead of giving up the child for adoption. So we had no messy legal right over it.

The childbirth and custody situation went very smoothly. My lawyer took care of it quickly and my ex made it easy as well. Her family didn't like this, but they couldn't do anything about it in the end.

So I have my baby daughter!

Taking care of my baby is difficult but certainly worth it. I feel like I have something to live for! My family has been super helpful and with their help we can make sure my daughter is happy. I also got a promotion at work. I realized that I need to be more ambitious because I now have a baby to provide for. A higher position was open at my work and I asked for the promotion but they told me I'm too young. I offered to do the job for as a trial 1 month without any extra pay only to prove that I can do it. After a month they gave me the job! 

As most of you suggested (and my lawyer did too), I had my lawyer file for child support after I had full custody. My ex didn't like it and wasn't expecting it. She actually called me names and various insults and all of that. But I didn't say anything, just that communications should go through my lawyer. She said she regrets making it easy for me to get the baby. I don't know. I didn't need the child support payments for daily care of my daughter but I think she deserves to have something saved up for the future and for her college. I didn't have the chance to go to college (not smart enough, I'm not good at studying) but I want to make sure my daughter has the chance! My sister in law is helping me setup a 529 plan with vanguard and I think I'll send most of the child support payments there once I start receiving them.

Massachusetts.,"So I received an email earlier this week from someone in the committee that handles scientific misconduct at my university. The email asked me to meet her to discuss a potential problem with my thesis.

I attended the meeting today. She said that there are 7 instances that I've committed plagiarism. I insisted that it isn't true and asked her to present me the evidence. She did. All of those seven instances are of me using sentences from my own prior work. Five are from papers that I have published and two are from my own masters thesis.

She also said part of the source code that I used where the original author was not properly credited. Again. I wrote the code myself and the original author she is referring to is me. 

After all of my explanations, she was still insisting that this is unacceptable and violating the proper scientific conduct guidelines of the university. At the end of the meeting she said that she wasn't convinced by my answer and is going to request a formal investigation by the committee and she said that I should be prepared for an unfavorable verdict.

I should also add that I recovered the entire conversation and listened to it again. At three points, she used the term ""you people"" or ""your people"", referring to me being Asian and not understanding plagiarism properly. I'm not the sort of person who accuses people of racism when they are critical of my work, but as she used my ethnicity as part her judgement of my work there, I don't know. It just sounded weird.

What's the next step for me? Do I need to see a lawyer here? Or should I let the investigation do its job and wait for their response.

One had minor surgery yesterday and we had just gotten home when the vet called because they forgot to give me a prescription he needs, and asked me to come get it.

While I was gone my landlord came over unannounced. Apparently the house next door, he also owns, had water in the basement from storms. He wanted to see if my basement was flooding too.

However apparently he was concerned about my dogs because one (the one who had surgery) wasn't moving much (he was still groggy) and the other was whining a lot (she was fine, she just whines when she's in her kennel but someone's around and she wants out).

He said that he and his wife were afraid that the dogs were in bad shape and needed water or something, so he let them out. He got the younger one (who just had surgery) out first and apparently the other (still in her kennel) started growing. She can be defensive of the younger one so I am guessing she was upset that a stranger was messing with the younger one who wasn't well.  She had been extra attentive to him since he got home licking him and trying to give him food so I think she could tell something was wrong with him.

Apparently even though the older dog was growling, they still let her out of her kennel. They said that the younger one went under the bed and the older one tried to keep them away from it, growling and barking when they tried to get the puppy out. Apparently they kept trying to get close, and eventually the landlord pulled the puppy out from under the bed and my older girl bit his hand. 

When I got home, they were still trying to get the puppy who had gone back under the bed, and my older dog was going nuts wimpering/barking/growling at them.  The landlord's wife had called animal control.  The bite had broken the landlord's skin just barely but was no longer bleeding.

Animal control came and checked my paperwork for shots and said normally they would take the dog for quarantine because it was involved in a bite incident, but they said that in these circumstances they didn't see a need to do so. They told me that I shouldn't expect any further issues with the situation and that they would talk to the landlord about what he should have done differently.

I thought that was it, however my landlord went to the ER. His wife told me that the ER didn't believe any treatment was needed but they elected to go through rabies meds just in case, so he is going through that treatment now.

Today they delivered a letter to my mailbox saying that they want me out by the end of the month or no more than 30 days from now because my animals have presented a dangerous situation on the property that keeps them from fulfilling their ownership duties safely.  He also told me in the letter that he will be keeping his ER visit and rounds of rabies meds from my deposit but that if the bills exceed it he will be forwarding me the bill.

At this point I'm not really even sure what I'm asking for other than just general advice anyone might have. It's probably obvious from my post but I am very frustrated by the situation because I had my dog properly contained and they chose to let them out even though the dog was growling, which should have been a warning sign to leave it alone. However I am not sure what the law says on this or what I'm in for. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6my9ca/dog_bit_landlord_who_was_being_dumb_landlord_gave/,legaladvice,1240,194,

No one knows what happened to management who asked for test behind closed doors but we imagine it was probably a lengthy reminder of what common sense is.

The lady I hit, for several weeks, refused to take the (verbally) agreed upon settlement and my insurance company put it on the back burner. In June they gave her 30 days to respond or they would rescind the offer. 

In the middle of June she hired a lawyer not connected to her insurance, rather a personal injury atty. I got a letter from the law firm telling me that I was going to be sued if I did not compensate their client the $40,000 she thinks she's owed from the car accident.

I kicked the letter off to my insurance company; I first called then emailed it: My adjuster that I was working with had an audible ""siggggghhhhh..."" after I read him the letter. Then a strained chuckle. ""We will take care of this.""

I heard back from them on Wed the 5th - They sent all documentation of the accident, the audio recording of her verbally agreeing to the settlement amount, and her ""manifesto"" to her newly hired atty. They apparently also included a note that stated that they were giving her until the end of June to accept the money or they would rescind the offer if she did not get this taken care of soon. 

My adjuster called me this morning to tell me that the issue has been resolved. She has signed an agreement yesterday that she cannot sue if she takes the money. According to my adjuster, they re-offered her the $40,000 because of two things: Primarily they wanted this to just go away and they did not want to be sued for more, second they apparently know of this personal injury atty, he requires a VERY high contingency percentage and this woman essentially played herself by hiring someone that was not necessary. He collected on her behalf and took his cut.

That's all I know, so yeah. Issue resolved and my insurance has jumped up a small bit in cost due to the accident. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6lvmd7/update_virginia_i_caused_an_accident_lady_i_hit/,legaladvice,7761,2,

We've lived in this house our entire lives. Our parents bought this house 27 years ago. They joined the HOA about 15 years ago.

My dad died 5 years ago, mom died 6 months ago. We are now the owners of this house.

We've been visited by the HOA multiple times, they're citing that we're not a single-family home anymore since our mom has died. They've told us that according to the terms, only a single family can be resident in the homes and being single family is defined as a person or couple and their legal unmarried children. This meant that my mom could live with me and my sister as it was a single family according to the definition, but me and my sister living here after our mom's death means we are two families of single adults. They want one of us to move out so that this place becomes a single family home again.

They've visited us FOUR times now asking us to leave. They say they don't like to sue our of respect for our parents but they will do that if we continue to refuse to comply by the community rules.

Can they kick one of us out of our own house? What should we expect and how can we fight this?

veryveryveryupset222,2017-07-05 21:59:50+00:00,"[Florida] [Update] I found out that my younger sister was sent away to a religious camp for her sexuality by my evangelical parents, who lied and took money from me (I believe) to fund it. I am furious.","I just posted a request with my ridiculous situation involving my sister.

https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6l3i1d/florida_i_found_out_that_my_younger_sister_was/

I got an incredible amount of varying advice and support that I really appreciate. I explained the situation to my boss, who was very supportive and gave me some time off without an issue to deal with this. Last night I left home and drove to them (they live in another part of Florida, but we all live there), and tried having a rational conversation with them before I took it. I pointed out the abuse I was learning was regularly at these communities. I told them all I stuff I've learned about these places. I demonstrated that it wouldn't even change her sexuality or opinion, and they just called me a liar or ignored me. I have never seen my parents in a lower regard. I didn't even bring up the money because I had a feeling that if I mentioned it he would kick me out. Both of them seemed incredibly nonchalant about the entire thing. Then I made an appointment with a lawyer, and then later another. Both of them were LGBT friendly and had at least some experience with similar situations, and both spent about an hour explaining to me how I am completely legally screwed due to the nature of the gift (and how it won't be interrupted as condition) and that I have absolutely zero legal grounds in getting my sister out, and that without even the name of the place I can literally do nothing. I am completely screwed. One drilled into me that I should not post about this to their friends or it may make any legal action that could be possible later impossible. But both basically told me there wasn't a thing to be done.

I was at my wits end, and I had a last-ditch plan. I drove back to my father's home and told him I would give him my remaining savings (around 65k, but I lied and said 55k so I'd have something) if he took her out of the camp and let her live with me. I was amazed that he would even consider it because I always considered him such a high moral figure but he stepped in the room with my mother for five minutes and said yes, but only if I did not involve the police. I told him he would need to sign a contract and wait a few days and he told me he may not have an issue with that (needs to think) but did not want her legally in my name (but she can live with me) because he doesn't want to be on the bill for child support. I wanted to spit in his face but I refrained. 

This just happened less than an hour ago. I made another appointment with another attorney tomorrow but I don't think that this is possible and I may not show up to his office. If I give him the money without any obligation to return it he would just take it and do nothing.

My idea at the moment is to agree to give them the money without a contract as soon as she is out and back at the house and I see her, and then take her and move to another state with her until she graduates. I can keep working in my current job from online until I get a new one. My father basically gave the impression that he had completely disowned her anyway, and I don't think he would spend the money a second time to get her in another place but obviously I'm just guessing. Obviously I cannot have a legal contract written where I buy custody of a minor. Can I have one where they promise not to send her to another institution like that? Like ""she must go to and graduate from X high school or something or you must return the money""?

Is there anything I can do to make this work in a way where she is out and with me (whether in my name with custody or not) and they don't have legal grounds to come and track us down and send her somewhere else? This sounds insane but I am insane. I'm so  worried. I'm vomiting randomly from guilt and stress. I can't sleep so I'm going to down a few sleeping pills so I can go to bed. 

Thank you very much, you have helped me immensely. It's disgusting how much the legal system can screw over innocent teens. I've never felt more angry during a 4th of July in my life. I don't know how we can profess freedom when stuff like this still happens and is legally justifiable.

Edit: We met and he detailed to me how I can easily go to jail with my plan, and just how dumb it is. I'm not giving them any money. But he made it clear that I have no legal recourse to get her. There is nothing I can do legally that will go anywhere. He advised me to try and settle this from ""a civil perspective."" They won't listen to reason. I have never hated anyone more than them. I feel like I fell in a black hole. I don't see any way out.

Oseirus,2017-07-05 11:50:22+00:00,"[N. California] Just found out my driver's license was suspended at the end of May due to ""Excessive BAC"". However, I've never been pulled over, or ever submitted to any sort of BAC test. Where do I even begin to fight this?","&gt; **UPDATE 3:14pm PST, 5 July**:

Well, the original guy from the DUI hearing office never actually called me back. I eventually ended up calling them and spoke with someone new. He checked my records and said that my license is showing Valid again, with no actions against it. I even pulled up my license history again from the DMV directly (probably a waste of $2 more, but I'll just skip on Taco Bell this week), and it's showing that I'm clear again. 

Cue gigantic sigh of relief.

--------------------

&gt; **UPDATE 9:53 am PST, 5 July**: 

CA DMV finally opened up. Called them, got stuck on hold for about 20ish minutes, finally spoke to some lady that told me that the normal DMV line doesn't handle DUI affairs. She could only tell me the county that I was allegedly ""arrested"" in, no specific precinct or city. Eventually she gave me a phone number for the Mandatory Action line (916-657-6525 for anyone else having this particular issue in the future), which is basically just an automated line that directs you to more phone numbers based on the area you live in. Found the number for a DUI hearing office close to me, and called.

I think I got super lucky this time around. Based on a lot of the stories here (and, ya know, DMV), I was half-expecting to be making phone calls all day, but after I gave him my information, the operator told me that my suspension was already previously flagged as an error. As of right now he's supposedly working to clear it out, and should call me in roughly an hour or so once it's done.

I am still glad I called, cause I have a hunch the suspension and error would have just sat forever if I hadn't, but I'll be the first person to admit that this went much more smoothly than I had originally figured.

I will update again once I know for sure the suspension is lifted. Thank you to everyone who gave advice and pointers, and for everyone else who has been through or is going through a similar problem, you have my deepest sympathies. 

-------------------

Let me preface this by saying that **I do not drink and drive**. I never have, I never will. I'm a responsible and good driver with a clean record, minus *one* at-fault incident back in 2013.

So, case in point, imagine my surprise when I go to change my insurance, and the new company (USAA) notifies me that my license has been suspended. 

Uh. What? 

Firstly, the last time I've ever even *spoken* to a cop for *any* reason was during a car wreck in 2014. I was not at fault (a woman ran a red light and smashed into me). Prior to that was a car wreck in 2013 that I WAS at fault for (rear-ended a stalled vehicle on the highway), but I promptly paid all of my dues ($200-something dollar fine), and the case has long since been closed. 

I gave $2 to CA DMV to pull up my license history, and this is what I receive (all personal information has been omitted):

    CLASS:C NON-COMMERCIAL &amp; M1 MOTORCYCLE*
    HEALTH QUESTIONNAIRE EXPIRES:NONE*
    LICENSE STATUS:SUSPENDED OR REVOKED*
    DEPARTMENTAL ACTIONS:
    PROOF REQ: V/09-21-17*
    TERM:09-21-20*
    ""
    DRV LIC SUSPENDED*EFF:05-21-17*

    AUTH:133532 ,13382*
    REASON:EXCESSIVE BLOOD ALCOHOL LEVEL*
    SERVICE:J/04-21-17*STATE:CALIFORNIA
    *
    CONVICTIONS:
    NONE*
    FAILURES TO APPEAR:
    NONE*
    ACCIDENTS:

    END

Unfortunately, this is the start and end of what information I'm able to pull up on the matter right now. There is a notice of an ""Order Mailed"" in April, but I never received anything even remotely related to a suspended license in the mail. Hence why this is just now coming up nearly three months later. 

A friend of mine mentioned I should talk to my local PD about the issue, but with my wife working all day and an (apparently) suspended license, it's now MASSIVELY difficult for me to get around. Is this the right first step? Or should I talk to the DMV first? Or is there someone else entirely?

Thank you in advance for the help. This is an utter surprise to me and I have no idea at all how to handle this. To say I'm livid would be an understatement...",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6ldj1m/n_california_just_found_out_my_drivers_license/,legaladvice,1413,128,

I am furious.","I posted this in r/relationships but I was told to post here. I live in Florida and so do my parents. This rest of this is a direct copy paste of what I posted there.

I posted a thing here a two years ago that helped me with an uncomfortable situation involving a boss at work and it helped me save a good friendship and my job, so hopefully you guys can help me again with a much much more serious situation. I didn't remember that account so I made a new one. I need to give a little background to explain the situation. This will probably be long. I'm shitty at writing so please bare with me.

I work as a computer engineer and live away from my parents. I moved out when I was 18, not because we had a particularly distant relationship, but because I was very hungry for independence and I didn't want to go to college like they wanted me to. I fell in love with programming and got a job a month after I graduated, and I've done that since. I am extremely frugal, and I now make about 70k a year after taxes (go mr. money mustache). Both my parents are in traditional white collar jobs that make significantly more money than I do, and they are horrific with money.

When I was growing up my parents were semi-religious (church on easter and christmas type of deal) and not particularly invested in it or politics. Somewhere in the last three or four years they became interested in it, and in the last year in particular (regarding the last elecion especially) they have become some of the most religious and overfocused political people i've ever seen. I have tried distancing myself from this by refusing to talk about these issues over the phone at all. I could not disagree more with them. I think they have some very hateful views, but I've chosen not to engage them on it.

Growing up I was not close to my younger sister, mainly because of our age gap. However she has grown up and is very pleasant to speak to. We have spoken on the phone daily (I speak to mom and dad much less frequently) since she was around 14. I have not been exposed to to much of this because I intentionally tell both sides I don't want to talk about their drama (although I am generally clear with my sister that I agree with her, but I don't want to badmouth her parents). My sister is a lesbian, which I have no issue with whatsoever, and my parents do not (or did not) know and would immediately be against. We talked about this a quite often. My sister also has political views completely at odd with my parents (she was in trouble for not supporting their favorite political candidate, you can probably guess who) but I encouraged her to swallow it and suck it up at home for her safety and sanity. She mentioned a few times in the last two months about wanting to come out to them and I highly highly discouraged it. I have heard both of my parents approve of a pastor who disowned his gay son and similar stories. I didn't want them to do that to her. I have offered to let her live with me when she turns 18 but imagined that being in the future. I made her promise not to do that and she did.

On her 16th birthday, she came out to them. I was a little angry with her over the phone (I didn't curse or scream or anything, but I was annoyed, but with sympathy for her position. I did chide her a bit, which I acknowledge was dumb.) She was extremely mad at me and didn't call me for four days, which was a long time for us not to speak.

We spoke afterwards and I was much better, but things weren't going well. They didn't kick her out but weren't speaking to her at all. Literally she was screaming at them and they just quietly went into their rooms, not saying a word.

I offered to speak to them for her and she begged me not to, so I did not, against my better judgement.

My Dad, a week later, called me over the phone. He said that he was sick and needed emergency money to have a procedure He begged me ""not to tell"" mom or my sister. He needed about 20 grand. I had refused them money in the past for a car loan and made it clear that I wasn't giving them money, but I did for this, cautious but ultimately trusting him not to lie about his own potential death. I disagreed with him about a lot of things but he had always been so steadfast about the importance of honesty the thought of him lying about something like that seemed ridiculous and I felt guilty for even thinking that.

About another week after that, my sister stopped calling me. I thought she was mad again for some reason but she didn't answer at all. I was worried. I called my parents and asked about her after about a week and they said she was being moody (I thought they thought I didn't know about her sexuality or what was going on).

I checked my Facebook that night and I read an days old message from one of her friends that explained that she had been trying to reach me and that my sister was taken from her house into a van and driven off by men in a program with her and my parents there before kicking the friend out of the house. Her friend visited my parents house several times and they eventually told her they sent her to a religious program. She didn't get the name.

I called up my father, and he denied it twice before admitting it after a long talk. I was so angry. They seriously have these religious camps that parents can send teens to anytime without committing a crime forever. I didn't think it had anything to do with the money, but I looked it up after that and found out that these programs are generally very expensive. I called him up again and he admitted that's where the money went. I demanded that he let her out and he told me it was his money. I told him I'd never speak to him again and he just ignored me. I try calling him up every few hours for the last several days when I found out and they ignore almost all of my calls.

He intentionally didn't tell me the name of the facility or camp, but I've done reading and these are almost always dangerous places. I don't even know if she is in the US anymore. People die and get brainwashed at these places. I feel so guilty for giving them the ability to do this. I don't know the name of the camp, and I did technically give them the money.

My only recourse at this point is to go tell everyone in their neighborhood what they did. I saw a facebook post they made about sending my sister to a snooty christian boarding school and that is NOT what they did. I called the school they posted and she isn't going there. They are very connected to the church/suburban town community and I think it would threaten them to have their image splattered with the truth.

I would completely disown them now if it wouldn't completely destroy my chances of getting her out. I am at a loss. Please help me.

tl;dr: My parents lied to me and took money claiming it was for an illness only to turn around and use it to send my sister to a camp because she came out. They are ignoring my calls. I don't have any legal grounds (i think) and I do not know how to convince them to let her out.

JavaJoe911,2017-07-03 12:09:16+00:00,Asperger's son with underage girls,"UPDATE: After talking with the police it seems these girls are in trouble for this kind of stuff and then blackmailing people to buy them stuff, give them money, etc. They were more interested in my son being yet another victim in the long list of people they've done this too. My son will NOT be charged with anything and in their works ""this is a parental issue, not a criminal one"".  Thanks for all the advice everybody.

[New York] Long time lurker on here but now I find my son in a bit of a jam.  My 20 year old son has Asperger’s Syndrome and huge problems with social skills and suffers from a below average IQ.  Mentally he’s about 15 or 16 but he’s slowly making strides. He don’t drive, doesn’t have a job, just graduated high school last week and took extra time to graduate due to struggling with some of the classes and students but managed to do it. He sees a counselor, and takes medication for anxiety and being OCD to the point he was in a mental hospital earlier this year. He’s a very trusting kid who has a hard time making friends and has been the victim of school pranks in high school because he is so gullible.

So he’s what happened in his words: Yesterday he was riding his bike through our town park when he was approached by two girls and they started talking and hanging out. Well I guess they were getting all chummy and my son said the one girl wanted to give him oral sex! She told him she was 18 and the deed continued.  Soon afterwards she admitted to him that they were not 18 but were 15 and 16! Thy told him unless they bought him beer and cigarettes they were going to tell the police.  He went into full blown panic attack and got himself outta there and had a bit of a meltdown.  My son is fascinated with law enforcement, knows most of the local police and on the way out of the park he see’s Officer Bob. In his panicked meltdown he proceeds to tell Officer Bob what happened.  They take a statement and then drive him home because he’s in such a state of psychosis he can hardly walk. Now he’s worked about going to jail and being labeled a sex offender. I feel as if these girls used him and now he may pay the price for it.

So my question is how much trouble is he actually in? I wished he’d talked to be before Officer Bob.

- Thanks for your Help
- Contacted Attorney, son met Attorney and shared all texts and call log, Attorney contacted Detective, shared  evidence, Detective dismissed claim, no need for my son to met the Detective, no citation ever issued.. all within 45 days

---
First at all thanks to all who provided feedback, it was really helpful. I meant to post this earlier but it is a throwaway account and was until now I figured the password.

Besides the situation the hardest part was to find an Attorney, I went to my local Bar website, searched for attorneys, but all the options were totally unknown to me and given how grave was the situation I did not know who to pick. I called two highly rated and the first thing that came from their mouth was $$$, I needed someone to trust my son's life not a merchant.

Yes, I have friends and acquaintances that are Attorneys, but I did not want to bring shame to my son, rationally I know this is secondary but was a factor.

I ended asking some friends for the name of their Divorce Attorney, because they speaks very well about the firm, called their office and explained the secretary that I needed to talk to the Attorney but for a referral, and explained what about and gave my friends' name as reference and asked for confidentiality.

My friend's Attorney called and calmed me and recommended an Attorney; This was huge.

I called the Attorney, explained the situation, and she communicated focusing on the problem and how to address it, not how much would cost me. Although it was already early afternoon she set a meeting with us same day in the evening.

We met with her that evening, prior to the meeting I asked my son to print all the text messages, and as he is on my family plan I printed the call logs.

Mi son sat with the Attorney, and the Attorney called the Detective and let them know that my son would not be going to the next day *conversation* and offered to talk about the situation.

Later the same week she called my son for a meet to go over the call log and text messages as she had questions about them, they met and asked my son to sit tight and wait for her call.

The Attorney called the Detective, went over the timeline of the report, who was really calling who, etc

Within the next four weeks the Attorney called us and told us that the Detective after reviewing the evidence recommended to the Prosecutor not to pursue charges and the Prosecutor agreed, no charges were pressed.

My son did not need to meet the Detective, there was not citation issued, and sadly learned the hard way about people and relationships.

The Key takeaway is do not talk to the Police without an Attorney, if you do not know an Attorney a friend does, civil, family, etc.. reach out to them.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6kp04w/update_gf_filed_for_sex_assault/,legaladvice,2264,1,
LilAcorn,2017-06-30 14:10:10+00:00,"[TX] Underage nephew used my mother's card to buy $3,000 worth of stuff on Amazon.","Hi! 
A couple weeks ago my mom noticed money going to amazon on her bank statements. The bank and Amazon were notified and she proved that it wasn't her making false claims so she was refunded the money.  Well yesterday I got on Amazon on my work computer (family business) noticed that my nephew logged in sometime this month into his account. Nephew spawn is fourteen with no credit/bank card so absolutely no need for him to have a prime account. I started looking at his purchase history and of course it was him using my mom's card. Spawn has his real name, phone number, used my brother's, his mother's and maternal grandparents address for delivery. 
 Now my family doesn't think anything is going to happened to him because she was already refunded the money but my understanding is Amazon still has a open investigation. He was buying ridiculously expensive toys with the most expensive being $937 for a phone which makes me think Amazon is not just going to let this go. 

Will he have legal consequences even if my mom refuses to file a police report?

texdogshoot,2017-06-29 17:23:15+00:00,Killed my neighbor's dog [UPDATE],"Original [here]
(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/3buv0v/neighbors_dog_killed_my_goats_i_killed_it_now_he/)

This all happened several months ago and it did get a bit exciting so I figured I would update as y'all seem keen on those.

Short story: I got more than I originally asked for.

Long story: neighbor got drunk and tried to drive his truck through my house (presumably. He hit a tree instead). Tree fell over onto my roof and destroyed it as well as quite a few electronics in the room under where the tree hit as it was raining quite hard at the time. Neighbor ended up with a broken leg, rib and arm. I got home a while after all this happened and found him still in his truck so I called an ambulance and sat there to make sure he wasn't going to die or try to do more damage. Anyway after it was all said and done his insurance wrote me a very large check for the roof and electronics and I got a court judgement for nearly what I was asking ($4500) for the goats and damage to the fence. I'm currently in talks with another lawyer to find out what it will take to get the tree replaced.

And the neighbor moved away. Don't know if it's just because he thinks I ruined his life or if he just sold his house to cover his costs. Frankly, I don't care. I just want him far away from me.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6k9uln/killed_my_neighbors_dog_update/,legaladvice,5275,2,
Helpforkiddo_plz,2017-06-28 20:27:42+00:00,"2nd Update for ""My teenage son is being sexually groomed""","[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/62hwid/my_teenage_son_is_being_sexually_groomed/)
[First Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/69aro6/update_my_teenage_son_is_being_sexually_groomed/)

This is to carry on the timeline and process for anyone else in a similar predicament. It's insanely long but hopefully thorough. 


We got an update from the detective a couple of days ago and I think things have come to a conclusion. I am so impressed with him and all he has done for us. I don't know if y'all will like how this is going to play out but we very much understand the ""reality"" of this situation. It's infuriating but indicative of the society we live in, especially in the south.


I want to clarify some details for ease of understanding the big picture. The person who was grooming my son is a woman around age 40. My son is age 15, turning 16 later this year. 


We've learned that predators have specific victims that they exploit; absent parents, kids with troubled backgrounds, low self esteem, access to the child, etc. On the surface, my son seemed perfect to groom.


We adopted him when he was 14 years old after only knowing him one month. He is black and we are white. He had a completely shitty childhood concerning his environment and people who raised him. Thank whatever higher power that he is the complete opposite of his upbringing. He has busted his ass to climb out of that hellhole and has succeeded every step of the way. This child has raised himself, we just give him the tools he needs to succeed faster. We gave him a complete fresh start with no attachments to his old life. We are not, by ANY fucking stretch, knights in shining armor, all accolades go to him. All we did was throw him a life preserver, he has done all the swimming. It is a privilege and joy to share his life, he is extremely humble, kind, generous, and stunningly well adjusted. He conducts himself with more grace and tact then any person I've ever known. 


He loves us and his new siblings fiercely, loyally, and very protectively. We feel the exact same towards him. This is our child, he is from our hearts, if not our bodies.


See, that's where Sick Bitch fucked up. She mistook his independence and our trust in him as indifference. Despite circumstances, our kid is a far, far cry from a 'troubled youth'. If anything, he is vulnerable, not an aggressor. She had no fucking clue of the depth and strength of our family. She didn't know the private side of our family life, only the public. She thought he was easy picking and, in a way, he was an ideal target. He has had to learn what is appropriate from parental figures and learn how healthy family relationships operate. He never had that growing up, he didn't know what is ""normal"" so he was easy to manipulate using a maternal approach. This is how he missed so many blatant red flags.


Her life: very attractive white woman, happily married for quite a while, strong leadership and ties in the local church, college degree, works with children... You get the picture.


Here's what it comes down to and I'll attempt to explain it accurately. In order to charge her with Sexual Exploitation of a Minor, there has to be ""intent"".The detective was unable to prove ""intent"". From what I understand, all of the grooming that she was doing must be for the purpose to promote a sexual relationship. Since there was no physical contact or her asking, saying, or obvious instigation that her actions were towards establishing sexual contact, ""intent"" can not be proven.  She was interrupted with her toe on the line. If this hadn't been caught at the precise point that it was, the detective is positive that she would have progressed much further. I am counting blessings over here.


Both sides of their stories, timeline, and events matched up perfectly. Her defense? She says that she had a huge lapse in judgement and it's being horribly misconstrued. She claims that she was acting as a friend, got caught up in a teenage mentality, feels horrible about the whole thing, blah, fucking blah, fucking blah.  EVERYBODY agrees that she was grooming our kid, no shadow of a doubt, it just didn't go far enough to prove sexual intent. We couldn't prove that she wanted to have sexual relations, only that she was viewing sexual material with him and discussing sexual subjects. Of course that is a relief but at the same time, I'm infuriated.


Hopefully someone with a better grasp of the law can explain this and make it easier to understand. We understand, it's just hard to put into words!


We were told that the DA's decision to move forward would heavily depend on our wishes. Moving forward would be weighed on proven evidence and on my son's testimony. The detective very tactfully and compassionately voiced our unspoken thoughts (my summation not his); It would be so fucking easy for a defense lawyer to make this my son's fault. Black, athletically fit, minor with a broken history, alone with a white woman who was scared or coerced into playing along. Upstanding white woman, relentlessly apologetic with hordes of people to testify of her integrity. Deep community ties up against the new kid in town.


It would be a breeze to turn preconceptions and insinuations into the ""truth"".


I cannot elaborate on this anymore it is too fucking enraging and horribly corrupt. I will leave all the rage to be explored in the comments... I could fill a novel.


If this were my decision to make, I'd do my best to destroy the bitch. However, this is my son's life - he would effectively be blamed during a trial, his life and history up for display, our family and parenting gutted and picked apart, and once again, he would live with constant stress and humiliation. Right now this is a private situation. If it became public, he is terrified of the teasing, hatred, condemnation, and frustration of exposing this person. Plus, we all know how this situation plays out in regards to older woman ""fantasies"" and the hypocrisy of how female predators are perceived.


At this point, kiddo's life has never been better and he is terrified to jeopardize his security and happiness. He has already paid dearly for shitty adults that abused him and he is adamant that he does not want to be the sacrificial lamb. He says does not want to give up his hard fought peace in the name of justice. We completely understand and support his decision.


We have spoken with the DA and have mutually decided to not pursue this due to the detriment it would cause our son.


During the conversation, the detective walked me through the steps in his investigation. He works the second shift so the majority of his legwork is conducted during the early evening hours. He asked me to read between the lines and understand that he had to remain professional and unbiased. He is a family man.


- She was provided a ride for all 3 of the interviews, conducted at times of his choosing and convenience



- All phones, personal computers, and other evidence was collected by several officers during late afternoon, early evening hours. It took around two hours. All of the spouses electronics were confiscated as well.



- Interviews were VERY intense and very very thorough. He elaborated more than this and it was VERY satisfying to hear.



- She was asked and had to account for every single video, message, and other evidence that was found on her devices. All the evidence corroborated my son's story perfectly, no discrepancies at all.



There were some more things but this is already insanely long. If anyone has experience with police investigations and can add anymore to this, please do!


All things said, more good came from this than harm. Though her actions were deliberate efforts to cause pain and destroy, the outcome brought forth love, compassion, and knowledge. My son now has even more strong, kind, and resourceful mentors in his life. Fuck her, she lost.


Thank you all so very much. Your kindness, support, and advice has been a huge source of comfort for me. Much love to all.

Flaterbaby,2017-06-26 14:29:31+00:00,[Texas] Employee shot in head with arrow while at job site.,"It was a blunt tip arrow used for target practice so the employee is ok.

While leaving job site a 14 y/o girl was shooting arrows at a target in her yard. Many of those arrow missed target and ""accidentally"" flew in the direction of my employees who were parked on the street and about to leave in their car.

With the amount of arrows ""missing"" the target and flying close to my employees, we think the employees were being intentionally shot at. 

One arrow hit the employee in the back of the head requiring a hospital visit for stitches. Her and the other employee that drove to the hospital missed rest of work that day. 

We took pictures of the wound and the bow and arrow used. Glad we took pictures of the bow and arrow because the parents of the 14 y/o took the bow and arrow inside before the police arrived. 

The police searched house and found bow and arrows.

I understand the 14 y/o's parent's home owner's insurance will cover medical. Can we go after lost wages for the employees, too?

What is the best route to ensure compensation is received for damages caused by the careless 14 y/o?

Immediately after, my wife's ex and the biological father of our children (yes, they may not be related by blood but I consider them my kids) has begun to try to take custody of them despite having had no direct contact with them for the past ten years when my wife had been pregnant with the youngest child. The guy has been paying child support but he is otherwise a terrible man that has abused and neglected my wife and kids until he ran off to start a new family with a woman he cheated with (and has now divorced her and abandoned her and their three children too).

I have not been able to adopt the children since their biological father is ""involved"" still. I have no idea why he wants custody but it may have to do with money. I have asked the kids what they want to do, and they say they would like to remain with me, and they don't like or trust their bio-dad. The children are 14, 12, and 10 respectively.

Is there any way I can retain custody of them? Will they automatically be placed with their biological father? Or can they remain with me while I fight for them? 

I live in New Jersey, their deadbeat father lives in Florida and intends to come up to take them with him, or so he claims. Yes, I am also in the process of getting a lawyer but I want to have an idea of how much of a fight I will have to put up...I have some money saved and...my wife has a life insurance policy that might end up paying the court fees...

Again the coworker without saying a word walks off. 

She complained that I was over the top rude and I should be fired for being sexist and having trouble working with women. Yet the two friends I showed pic are female. And the pic I took was with my personal phone and I wasn't asked by anyone to take the pic nor was I asked by the coworker for me to show her the pic.

ta1089197,2017-06-24 19:46:05+00:00,[UPDATE] Would love some advice on the theft and attempted destruction of my cat.,"[So here we are a little over a week later.](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6hgsub/new_zealand_would_love_any_advice_on_the_theft/) I am getting the last of my statements for the SPCA and they are nearly sorted.

I had answered two belligerent phone calls from them at work and refused to answer two more. Since the phone call harassment was no longer working, they emailed my work and said if I did not answer we would have 'personal issues' going forward, how dare I contact the SPCA, that their cat had an abscess they assume was from my cat and I need to pay for their $330 vet bill thanks.

I emailed back with a pretty direct email that their actions constituted cruelty, I wouldn't be answering any further phone calls especially at work and that I would not be paying the vet bill. Friday morning I check my email and the partner had sent me a rambling, abusive email. I abuse my dog, I'm a shit vet tech, how dare I call the SPCA, of course it was my cat, he's taking me to small claims court because what other choice does he have? He said he knows he doesn't have much of a chance at winning but it's about the principle. I reply that the SPCA is doing their due diligence, that my pets are well cared for and that they are not to contact me any further. I have since blocked both of their email addresses.

I got to work Friday morning and discovered they had lodged a formal complaint to my workplace and asked to have a sit-down meeting with my manager about 'what I consider to be a very serious situation for me and my family'. One of my managers called and p much said they have to look into it, but by all accounts it would appear everything I've done at work has been within policy. This job means everything to me and I'm pretty fucking annoyed they've taken a personal issue and forced it upon my workplace.

I also spoke with two local cat charities who both knew of the feral cat colonies in the vacant property literally directly behind their house and in the house to the left of them that's full of discarded vehicles. One of them had spent months and months before I moved there and early on trying to catch a large, black tomcat with abscesses all around it's neck but had never managed to get him. They advised them within hours of having caught my cat by mistake that they either needed to take care of it or take it to the vet ASAP, as did the council who I spoke to on Friday. They found these people extremely difficult also. I have attained statements from both of them outlining this, so that's a comforting addition. 

I am doing my best not to be as vindictive and malicious as they are. I happen to know their house is unpermitted and has numerous code violations and by god my council-calling finger is itchy but I am not going to be as shitty as they are. I have alerted my friends at the local newspaper to keep an ear out for me because I don't doubt that when this complaint and small claims court fails them they will probably double down on the crazy. I am also preparing myself internally for them to complain to the SPCA about me because that seems inevitable.

All in all this has been an extraordinarily exhausting two weeks. I am hopeful I can make an update shortly that outlines this entire thing being over. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6ja3qi/update_would_love_some_advice_on_the_theft_and/,legaladvice,1405,1,

They seemed to believe me and explained to him and also showed him the invoice. They took a statement from me and told me they would be in contact if there were further issues but they didn't charge me with anything and just left after they spoke with me.

Now my neighbor has emailed me saying he is going to take me to small claims court for trespassing and theft, and he listed the amount as $2000. The bed frame I bought of Amazon was $190, and I didn't cause any damage to his property while retrieving it.

Backstory: I work a minimum wage job in food service. A few weeks ago I asked to get my check from the safe at work and it was missing. I found out last week it had been cashed in my name. I called corporate and they said I'd have to sign an Affidavit of Forgery. Yesterday I received a picture of my cashed check and my coworker's name was clearly written on the endorser's line. How it got cashed I have no idea. We're not even the same gender. I have informed my manager of whose name appeared there. I'm getting the Affidavit notarized and sent back to corporate first thing Monday morning. 

My issue: My manager has told me to file a police report in the meantime, but I feel like that should be corporate's responsibility since the check was never in my possession. I am also afraid to point the finger at my coworker because some other asshole employee might have written their name to frame him. Should I still file the report?

ForumPointsRdumb,2017-06-16 12:22:36+00:00,UPDATE: Need advice. Friend's ex-wife trying to keep children from him. (x-post /r/MensRights),"[Original post to /r/legaladivice](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6gfpwz/need_advice_friends_exwife_trying_to_keep/)

There was a request for an update in this sub, guess I should follow through on that. 

So the court date was for Thursday and not Wednesday. Which wasn't bad, it gave him an extra day to prepare. He did not hire a lawyer, but instead chose to represent himself. 

His case was called earlier. His ex-wife's lawyer was not there. Ex-wife not there. The judge dismisses the case. The exwife's lawyer gets there late, but Buddy is still there. The lawyer pulls some sort of strings to get the case reopened. So it is back on again.

So it is Buddy's turn again. The judge asks him if he wants a continuance because he was served within 10 days of the court date or something like that. He says ""No, I want to get this done today."" The ex-wife's lawyer has the face of someone who shat a brick. The ex-wife is not present, she was at work. Both lawyer and her expected the continuance. Lawyer calls his client, the ex-wife to get her to the courthouse. Judge annoyed.

So while he waits for her to get there, other cases go on and he sees what to do, and what not to do. Only ask questions, don't make statements.

Ex-wife finally gets to courthouse, they are set to be the last people seen. She has a shit-eating grin on. So she takes stand and Lawyer basically asks her a bunch of questions that helps her make her case. 
Then Buddy gets to ask her questions. I only wish I had the quick wit and memory of this man. He starts asking her all sorts of questions. Her lawyer tries to object to a few questions, but the judge deemed them pertinent and had him continue. He asked her something and she gave a smart reply and ended with ""...You'd know if you'd LISTEN."" He keeps referring to himself in the third person as the defendant when asking questions. She states that every time he has an injury it all the fault of this ""coffee table."" As if he is just blaming a table. He brings up a time the child came into his care injured, 6 stitches above his eye. ""Did you tell the defendant that child was injured immediately?"" She replies ""No."" He continues with, ""And how did he sustain that particular injury."" Her response, ""He ran into a table.""

It was glorious.

Anyway, she states that she is in fear for her and her daughter's safety after a supposed violent martial arts incident in 2011 where he almost killed her and her daughter was scared. He asks her, when exactly it happened. Gets 2011 again. Asks if she has proof of her injuries. None. Asks if she has proof he is violent and unstable. None. Asks if she went to the hospital for the life threatening injuries, she says no because she feared for her and daughter's safety and couldn't leave her alone with him. 

He then simply asks how old their daughter is. She is 4.

That was pretty much it. Ex-wifes lawyer didn't have any more questions and the judge dismissed the case and the restraining orders. He has some follow up cases for custody and such now. Hopefully he will get his kids this weekend. He has thought about suing her for defamation or something. I don't know, I think he should just take the win.

Thanks for the advice you all gave. Apparently he was already using the legal aid site, is how he got the original documents to hold her in contempt of court order.

GODDAMN_FARM_SHAMAN,2017-06-15 14:00:46+00:00,Ex-Wife used my PayPal account while running an Etsy business. She never paid taxes and now the IRS is coming after me. (x-post personalfinance),"Michigan, USA

Background: I was married from August 2013 to August 2016. In October 2013 my exwife started an Etsy business and used my PayPal account to process payments. During our marriage we never combined finances and filed taxes as married filing separately (or so I thought).

The issue: Apparently my exwife never updated the personal information on the account like she said she did and the account was still connected to my social security number. Long story short, I recieved a bill from the IRS yesterday stating that I owe just over $10k in taxes for 2015 as well as self employment taxes for the money ""I"" made via PayPal.

FWIW, I never saw any tax forms from PayPal. My Exwife said she had taken care of her taxes and like I said, we never filed together or combined finances so I had no way of knowing. 

Has anyone ever dealt with a situation like this before? Is there a way to transfer this to my ex wife (who I am assuming just never payed her taxes)? Where do I start? Should I call the IRS directly? Right now I am preparing to call my divorce attorney and see if he can refer me to a tax attorney.

payformyfood,2017-06-15 01:16:33+00:00,Ohio - Neighbor says I must pay for all lost food during 48+ hour power loss for the entire neighborhood because it was my fault,"Backstory:
A few weeks ago at 2am on a Friday morning I was I was awoken by the loudest lightning strike I have ever heard and immediately lost electricity. It shook the entire house and scared the shit out of me and my dogs. I got up to make sure the house was not on fire and looked out into the front and back yard to see if there was any fallen tress or anything. I didn't see anything out of the ordinary so I just went back to sleep. Around 530am I can hear big electric company trucks parked out on the street and see workers walking up and down the street with flashlights. I go back to sleep for a few hours until I have to get up for work and discover that the power still has not come back on. After work still no power so I decide to take my dogs over to a friends house to hang out instead of sitting around in the dark and I end up staying the night. On Saturday morning I come home and still no power so I spend the entire day out and that evening when I still didn't have electricity I stayed over at my friends house again. This time I didn't come back home until Sunday evening. By then the electricity was back on but I could tell that the problem must have been with the pole that is in my back yard because workers had obviously been back there. On one side of my house the very heavy wooden gate was left open and on the other side there is a small section where I just have some wire fencing held up by stakes and it was completely taken down and was leaning against the house. I put the fence back up, throw away a bunch of food that I am not sure still ok to eat and life goes on.

Today:
This afternoon Pat, one of my neighbors, stops to talk to me while I am outside. She just wants to give me the heads up that she will be by soon with a bill of what I owe everyone for all the food that had to be thrown away. She claims that the electric company has stated that the reason it took so long to fix the problem is because I wouldn't answer my phone or door to give the workers permission to enter my backyard and take care of the problem. Pat says the she personally had to throw away over $1000 worth of meat and that she will be going around to all the other neighbors to see what they had to throw away and then she will be presenting me with a bill of how much I owe each person. I didn't really know what to say so I kind of just walked away without saying much.

I never got any phone call from the electric company and they never knocked on my door while I was home. My plan is to tell Pat to fuck off but I just want to check to make sure I'm not obligated to pay for the neighborhoods spoiled food. I've had problems with Pat in the past (not legal ones) but I do know that she has sued 2 other neighbors for petty grievances and lost both times. I can tell her to fuck off right?

Edit: Wow this got big. Thank you to everyone for your replies. It seems the consensus is that Pat can fuck off which is good to know. I will of course respond if she actually tries to sue me. For now my plan is to completely ignore Pat. Also, I think I might bring up the situation one of my neighbors that I am the most friendly with and see what he says because I would prefer not to become the neighborhood outcast.

He stressed the word ""all"" which leads me to believe he'll make up some pretty grandiose stories.

Seven_Days_Ago,2017-06-12 00:44:23+00:00,[Ohio] Company next to my property has scheduled a tree removal on my property without my consent. What are my rights?,"I live next door to a company where their parking lot runs right up to the edge of where our property meets. There is a 200 foot tall tree about a century old. The majority of the tree is on my line, about 90%. When I bought the house 15 years ago, the tree butted against the property but now is growing slightly on the property. 

While taking a walk today, I was approached by two tree trimmers. They were working a job for this company and asked if I owned the property next door. I told them yes and they asked for permission to come on my property. I was confused and he explained that the owner of the property scheduled the tree to be removed on Tuesday. This was the first I heard of it and pointed out the clear property line markers. I told him he did not have permission to access my property, nor remove the tree since the majority of the tree rests and originated on my property. He responded that it's better if I let them remove it, that way the owner of the property would not charge me to have it removed.

I instructed them that I had no intention of having it removed because it creates a physical visual barrier of the neighbors land and I enjoy watching the various wildlife that use it. Furthermore, I was displeased that I was not given any notice of the removal. 

I'm kind of at a loss on what I can and can't do because I can't physically watch my property at all hours, especially at work. Is anyone familiar with property law and how this would work? I'm not opposed to them trimming branches that extend on their property but I take issue with them accessing my property without permission. If I consent to the tree removal it's because I don't have any recourse but I also want assurances that if my property is damaged, they will be liable for it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6gozo7/ohio_company_next_to_my_property_has_scheduled_a/,legaladvice,1002,139,
neighborkilledmytree,2017-06-11 01:39:24+00:00,[PA]Neighbor killed my 150 year old trees (ms paint included),"I have not reached out to anyone yet, but was hoping I could get some idea of what my situation was here.

So, I live in a very old home, more than 200 years, with some very old and gorgeous trees on the property.  They are these stunning Sycamore trees, well over 100 feet tall (trunks 6-8 feet in diameter) that provide shade/cooling for our house in the summer.  

The lot next to our house has been an overgrown mess for decades.  We've tried to buy it, but the owner is trying to develop.  He's not a part of this story.

Across the street from the next door lot, is the neighbor in question.  He got tired of the overgrown lot that was in between our houses, and decided to cover a large portion of the lot with Ortho Ground Clear.  He didn't talk to anyone before he did this, didn't get permission from the owner, and definitely didn't talk to me (my kids play over there, so I was immediately worried).  

Anyway, a little bit after he sprayed this stuff, my two trees that have been completely healthy up until now started getting wilted leaves.  The tree that he sprayed closest to has hardly any leaves at all on it now, the other tree has a noticeable number that are turning brown.  I looked at the instructions for Ground Clear, and it says not to spray under the canopy of any trees that you want to keep.  

I'm pretty sure that this guy has killed my trees, and am wondering where this puts us.  The trees were awesome, and still had a lot of life left.  I had an arborist come out a few years ago, who told me that they may last 50 - 100 years or more, given their current good condition.  I'm also worried about the cost to remove them, I'm guessing that the removal bill will be in the 30k range.  Can I put him on the hook for the removal of the trees?  What about the value that they provided us?  At the absolute least, my AC bills are going to skyrocket with no shade, but we also just really liked these trees.  

I know you guys like trees, and I've heard you like [bad MS paint drawings](http://imgur.com/a/ObAuq), so I thought I'd get opinions here.

I ignored him and called the apartment complex in the morning and told them who i was and how i got out of the lease and asked if there were any bills or anything i still owed them.

I sent a text to my exroomate yesterday that because of the SCRA i wasnt fined anything. I got out on orders and all i needed to pay was last months utilities. I asked him wth he was talking about a 450 dollar fine and he didnt respond. I called him and it rang once and went to voicemail. At that point i got the message loud and clear and blocked him.

DogAccident89,2017-06-05 13:58:15+00:00,"[Illinois] Hit an off-leash dog with my car, owners demanding I pay a $6,000 animal hospital bill","Hi everyone.

I was driving through a suburban neighborhood last week Thursday on my way to work when a pit bull off-leash jumped out in front of my car and I hit it head on at around 30 mph. I stopped and the owners came out. The dog was very messed up and I didn't think it would live to be honest. I was pretty upset about it. The guy owner took it to the local 24/7 animal hospital and the woman owner sort of comforted me and said it was an accident and their fault because they ""can't​"" keep the dog on the leash.

Anyway I exchanged contact information with the lady because I said I wanted to help anyway I could. I didn't mean financially. 

The wife texted me that the dog was ""doing ok"" and later texted me that he was ""out of the hospital"". Because I still felt awful I went and got a giant dog gift basket from the store filled with dog treats and toys and went to deliver it to their house this morning along with a ""get well soon"" card. I was met by the husband who was a total jerk. He told me he had to figure out how to pay a $5000 hospital bill for the dog and that the dog was ""permanently disabled"". I said I was sorry but I don't have that kind of money. He told me to call my auto insurance about it or he'd have to take me to small claims court. I said it wasn't my fault his dog wasn't on a leash and he said he'd ""see me in court"" and that was the end of our conversation.

Am I liable for the vet bills of the dog? I was going about 5 mph over the speed limit but otherwise following​ all traffic laws. Don't want to involve my insurance because afraid of rates going up.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6febcr/illinois_hit_an_offleash_dog_with_my_car_owners/,legaladvice,1556,122,
throwaway17188,2017-06-04 17:25:04+00:00,I (21) am being stalked by my TA (30) who is suicidal; he threatened to bring me up on untrue academic dishonesty charges,"I'll start off by saying that I was a history major in my university's combined BA/MA program. I graduated this May and was accepted into a doctoral program starting this fall, which is why his threat about academic dishonesty (albeit baseless) is so scary to me.

Felix was the graduate TA for a MA class I took this spring. On the first day of class, Professor B asked us to introduce ourselves. Besides the usual ice-breaker stuff, I said that I am interested in x area of study and am currently conducting research under Professor A.

After the class ended, Felix approached me and excitedly rambled about how he is a PhD student in that exact area of study, and Professor A is his advisor. I thought that that was pretty cool, and we talked while he walked with me to my next class.

The following night, I received a text from Felix. I thought it was weird, since I didn't give him my number, but he said he got it from my professor (the one that he's TAing for). I didn't think much of it, because I swamped with work and wasn't thinking clearly. He told me he would like to give me some books/articles that he really enjoyed. I agreed, because hey, free academic texts! He gave me the texts in class. This is one instance that he later told me I led him on/took advantage of him.

Another, and the biggest, instance: I often study in my school's Humanities lounge until 3-4am. The doors to the Humanities building lock from the outside at 11pm, so no one is really in the building past that time. One night, after coming back from the bathroom, I see Felix sitting in the Humanities lounge directly across from where my stuff is. No one else is in the room.

He laughs it off and says that he usually works in his office (which is in the Humanities building), but he needed a more open space. I was a bit creeped out, so I told him that it's no problem-- I was just about to leave. He looked really offended when I said that and asked what is wrong with him, which led to a tirade of self-hating debilitating questions and the confession that he's suicidal.

I felt so uncomfortable and awkward, but I didn't want to leave him there by himself. I had lost a friend two years ago to suicide, and it hurt to see someone like that again. So I heard him out and told him that he's not a bad person; voice your concerns, etc., etc. I told him, however, that I'm not a therapist and it would be a really good idea to go to get psychological help.

He then rambled on and on about how he can't because he's scared. But he finally agreed to go in the morning as long as I take him there. We have a mental health care facility on campus-- a 5 minute walk from the Humanities lounge. I told him I'll walk with him tomorrow morning, but for now I'm going to my dorm. He begged me to stay but I told him that I'm really tired and left. (I didn't want to say uncomfortable and hurt him).

I was thoroughly creeped out and left to my dorm. That morning, I walked him and checked him into the health clinic. I thought the worst was over.

I hadn't heard from him for a week, and I kept my distance from him. The next weekend, I went to a sorority party. Sorority parties are of course huge, and of course random people show up, but he was there. I left before (I think) he saw me, and I drove back to my dorm. I saw him several other times in random places after that: the library, the cafeteria, the atrium, etc. They were such common places for a student to be in that I kept on dismissing it as coincidence.

I stopped working in the Humanities lounge after that night. I started working in our biggest building, which has 8 lounges. He found said me one night, and told how no one else ever cared about him like that to the point that they forced him to go get help. He said he's a lot better now because of me. I told him he got it all wrong; the health professionals are the ones he needs to thank. He kept on rambling and eventually asked me to date him. I told him no; I'm not interested like that.

Fast forward a few weeks and a several instances like those. It's the end of the semester, and I'm just glad I won't have to see him again. I'm at an enormous park, just reading my book. I see him out of the corner of my eye, and he's jogging toward me. God knows how he found me, but he told me, to my face, that he's planning on bringing me up on academic dishonesty charges for an inappropriate relationship, and therefore unearned grade, with a TA. (While TAs don't give the final grade, they give preliminary/tentative grades for papers). He then ran his hand up my dress and groped my ass and said hot thong in public.

This will obviously affect him, as well. I'm scared, and I don't know what to do. I did what I thought was best in the moment-- to help someone who is suicidal and did my best to maintain a professional distance. Likewise, I kept on avoiding him for the rest of the semester to the best of my ability, but he said him giving me books and all those instances shows favoritism. He also said regarding the party that he could say that I invited him to come with me and that I made sexual advances.

I don't get why he's doing this to me. I don't understand why he wants to hurt me so badly. I don't have any proof besides the texts of him offering to give me the books and a few friends that I told about him. I know I should have told my professor from the start, and I hate myself for it. I should have just avoided him from the start, but now I'm stuck in this situation and I don't know what to do.

I don't know if anyone will believe me if I go to the university and tell the truth. I don't know if I do tell the truth if my acceptance will be taken away. What if they believe him? What do I do?

TNRearended,2017-06-02 19:17:11+00:00,Rear-ended on purpose by a Juvenile.,"So like the title says I was rear ended a few nights ago by a 17 year old driver. I would like to know what sort of legal action I can take (if any) and I would also like to know what will happen after our court date. I'll give the best description of the story as I can: 


The other night I was on my way home from work on a two lane road and there was a truck in front of me. The speed limit on that road is 40mph and the truck in front of me was going approximately 20mph. I was following behind him a little closer than normal because I thought he would speed up or move over. He tried to brake check me, but I wasn't following so close that I had to slam on my brakes or anything. I gave him benefit of the doubt and thought maybe a dog ran out in front him or something. So as we're traveling he tries it again. This time I flashed my lights at him to gesture that he should either pull over and let me by or go on. (I didn't realize at the time that this was illegal in the state of TN.) He came to a stop in the middle of the lane and I went around him. Not long afterwards I saw his headlights approaching at a high rate of speed and he slammed into the back of my truck. This caused me to lose control and I flipped my truck a few times down a hill, through a fence, finally stopped rolling on the driver side of my truck. So I climbed out the passenger side door and called the police. He was caught down the road because he lost all the oil out of his engine.  


To make a long story shorter, he admitted to hitting me on purpose because he was angry. I still don't know if he had insurance. It was actually his Grandfather's truck. He was arrested with an aggravated assault charge and I was told I am going to subpoenaed to court in a few months. He's 17 and still considered a Juvenile, but apparently turns 18 in a month. I've never been involved in something like this. What's the process? How is him being a juvenile going to change things? Can I and should I sue? Thanks for any and all advice in advance.

thisthrowaway12388,2017-05-28 11:12:42+00:00,[Ohio][UPDATE] HOA president threatening me for following state law,"OP - https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6d6u1g/ohio_new_hoa_president_is_threatening_me_for/


Hello again, it's me with an update to my situation with the HOA president. I'll get it out of the way now - no, he didn't clamp my car and no, he didn't get arrested. As much as that would have been a more entertaining update I think this will still satisfy legaladvice for today.


So, my chief was pretty mad at this guy already, but when a certified letter appeared at the station addressed to myself and the vol. fire department demanding payment of fines and threatening again, IN WRITING, that he would clamp my vehicle, it was like a red rag to a bull. Oh well, as they say, never interrupt the enemy when he is making a mistake.


So my chief called a buddy he knows in the command staff at the sheriffs office, and they went over to this guys place with a couple of officers. I get the feeling that the deputies were probably more likely to need to protect the HOA president from the chief than the other way round, but there you go. It was explained in no uncertain terms to the president what the law was and what he was risking, and he has now backed down. The sheriffs also said if he tries to retaliate please don't hesitate to give them a call. There is a nasty letter from a lawyer that will be turning up on his doorstep within the next day or so as well, courtesy of the county director of emergency services and the city.


The rest of the HOA community has already come out and said this guy is an asshole, and they are looking at getting him voted out. I am very privileged to enjoy a lot of support from my local community for what I do and I definitely don't take that for granted.


I also want to go ahead and clarify some things that came up in my OP.


Regarding state law that says you must have sirens on while lights are on, I spoke to the chief about it and we are going to get absolute clarification on that from higher up the chain. I would also like to say I may have gotten confused as our department policy states that we must be using sirens while lights are on, however my chief does acknowledge that this can be counter-productive in some scenarios, so he will get the advice then review the policy if necessary.


There also seemed to be a little confusion regarding my vehicle. It is my personal vehicle which is fitted with lights and sirens. It does not belong to the fire department and is not overtly marked, however when I am responding to a call it is counted as an emergency vehicle. 


Finally, regarding my driving. u/mechdrunk I am truly sorry that happened to your sister and the I hope the volunteer who was driving was appropriately disciplined and his rights to drive code were revoked. As you said yourself, I am required to drive with due regard for other road users and safety, and I take this very seriously. My comment about hauling ass was probably a poor choice of words given that between my house and the main road where I have to slow down and stop anyway (STOP sign) is only about 5 or 6 houses. So despite all of the downvotes you got, I do take your comment seriously.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6dta53/ohioupdate_hoa_president_threatening_me_for/,legaladvice,2819,1,
displaynamechris,2017-05-27 12:57:15+00:00,"My employer put a GPS system in everyone's vehicle that also tracks if the employee brakes ""too hard"" or accelerates ""too quickly"". We are being graded based on these errors using an arbitrary number that the owner has picked. Scores under a 90% is failure.

The $500 that was being deducted would come out of my bonus/commissions, not my salary. Sorry for any confusion.

Hello r/legaladvice,

Like the title says. My owner is doing some things that I feel aren't legal. I've also requested specifics regarding these violations so that I can avoid them in the future. I am in the US and in Texas.

I'm assuming that I'm penalized when I surpass a certain RPM too quickly or apply too much pressure to the break pedal. But either the equipment isn't accurate every time or there are other variables involved because I can't seem to pinpoint what I need to do to eliminate my errors (that's just when it's within my control). The owner will not give me the guidelines to these violations so I don't even know what to not do.

After implementing this system he felt that anything below 90% (I do not know where he got this percent) would be treated as a failure for that quarter and penalize anyone who failed by taking $500 from their paychecks. I received an 89% so I was penalized. It was than discovered at a later date that the system will often times give employees a score of 99% when they hadn't even driven that day. So he changed the failure score to 89%, but would not reimburse me despite the inaccurate measuring.

I know there are things that every driver can do to make themselves better but it seems half of the time when I receive a violation it's the result of another driver which makes losing $500 even more frustrating.

I guess my concern is, can my employer create whichever kind of rules he'd like to and penalize us for whatever amount of money he wants to penalize us for not following those rules?

Thanks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6dnk13/my_employer_put_a_gps_system_in_everyones_vehicle/,legaladvice,3910,251,
macbookcouch,2017-05-26 14:27:09+00:00,"[Super Awesome Update] Sat down on my friend's MacBook and broke it, offered to pay her the money for it but now she wants more because ""she was upgrading anyway"" so it's this or she will sue me in small claims court.","I never thought this would turn out the way it did and I really felt like I learned so much stuff in the process thanks to all of you. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/641joo/sat_down_on_my_friends_macbook_and_broke_it/) is my previous question. 

I went through every single comment from the 200+ ones and I sincerely thank each and every one of you.

I did some research specifically for repairing the screen for the macbook and for her particular model it’s around 310 for the screen + the labor cost so I wrote her back saying that since she didn't accept my initial offer of $2200, I’m withdrawing that offer, and offering to pay for the repair cost. She sent me an email calling me a bitch and that she’s going to take me to court.

I got served a few days later and went to court. I told the judge I gave her three options to choose from. 1) either to write her a check for a brand new one which was 2200 dollars. 2) Get her a refurbished one from apple or a third party or even used which would be around 1400 dollars or 3) fix her current MacBook since the screen is the only thing affected here and it would cost around 300 dollars plus money for labor. (I printed out the email I sent her and the mail she sent back refusing demanding the 2700 and calling me a bitch and saying we’ll go to court + screenshots for the price quotes from different websites for a new/refurbished and the screen fix for her particular model) and gave it to the judge. I also told him that when I offered at the very beginning to get her a new one from the apple store she said no I want the money in cash. When I told her I’d give her 2200 for a new one she said okay but later came asking for 2700 because she wants to upgrade. I tried to show him how it's clearly visible that she's trying to take advantage of me.

She gave the judge an attitude almost the whole time which really pissed the judge off and helped my case I guess. After listening to both of us he ruled that I pay 50% of the repair cost since she negligently left her laptop on the couch. So I'll only be paying not more than 200-250 dollars for the whole thing.

If it weren’t for you guys I would’ve paid $2,200 dollars instead of around $200 and I honestly loved her look at the end as we walked out. 

I feel good for following all the advice here.

Throwlegal9,2017-05-24 23:28:28+00:00,"[Indiana] Landlord pulls rental agreement when he meets me for the first time, refuses to refund my $100 application fee, I think it’s because I’m black.","I found a great place on Craigslist several weeks ago that was going to be available on Tuesday. When I called, the guy was very polite, talked me through everything, sent me the link to the rental application on his website, made everything really simple. I did some research myself to make sure it was all above board, being on Craigslist and all, and the phone number and website definitely match up to the property owner. There’s no office since it’s only a 16 unit building but the guy is locally known for owning it. It definitely isn’t a “meet me at starbucks with cash/money order” type of apartment listings, it’s real.


Since I live out of state I knew I wouldn’t be able to see the inside of it first, but a friend who lived in the same building a couple of years ago said they’ve just been renovated and he confirmed the pictures were what I could expect. Great! Send in the application and $100 admin fee, he contacts the place I rent from now, gets my credit and calls my work. A week later he emails me and says that everything came back good, he’d just need the first month of rent and a $250 deposit on the day I move in.


Fast forward to yesterday and I meet the owner there at 10 am. I tell him my name and he goes “The same (my name) who I’ve been talking to at (my phone number)” Yep that’s me. “And your email address is (my email address)?” Yes it is. And he just stood there for about 10 seconds looking at the paperwork and said he’d be right back. He went to his car and I think he got on the phone. Maybe 5 minutes later he comes back and says “I’m sorry, but there’s been a mistake, your credit came back unsatisfactory, you can’t have the apartment”


When I told him I don’t have any loans - student or car, and I pay my credit card off every month so I can’t possibly have bad credit he just said “Sorry, it’s not available” as he’s basically jogging back to his car at this point. He just drove off, I’m standing there alone flabbergasted, what the hell just happened?


As I’m driving to my friends house to help him clear some space in his garage for my furniture, which is now on its way with the movers and I have to change the delivery address, it hits me. This guy hadn’t seen me before, my name is something very common so he couldn’t have known what I look like. He just lied to me and refused to rent to me, after he said everything was fine, because I’m black.


When I emailed him demanding the $100 fee back he replied back with “Sorry, that fee is non-refundable” I’m out nearly $1000 from the movers, the $100 for the admin fee and I’m probably going to have to take the first thing I can find apartment-wise because I don’t want to be a burden to my friend in his guest bedroom.


How can I get my $100 back and possibly my mover’s fee from this guy?",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6d5vzt/indiana_landlord_pulls_rental_agreement_when_he/,legaladvice,3524,88,
AnonsWalkingDead,2017-05-23 22:21:09+00:00,[WA] My dog was abused at a dog kennel while I was out of town.,"I had to leave the state for a few days to attend a funeral so I dropped my 4 month old puppy off at a kennel while I was out of town. I returned back today and I went to the kennel to get my puppy, when I arrived they literally were dragging her as she whimpered and pissing. (This is very very unlike my dog, she's very social and energetic) so I knew something was wrong immediately, I got a closer look and noticed her head was bleeding and her eyes were full of blood. I rushed her to a emergency vet where they told me her skull was cracked from physical truama and she will lose an eye and she will never fully recover from the brain trauma. I'm utterly furious right now. What steps should I take to sue these pieces of trash? 


Edit: Thank you all so much for the advice, I took the pictures and the paperwork from the vet to the police station, the owners are now being looked into for animal abuse. I also will be taking them to court for the $1600 vet bills. For now I will inform as many people as I can about what happened and to avoid their business.

foxhoundshade,2017-05-23 17:31:14+00:00,Update - Consequences of crossing the border at Area 51.,"OP here: https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/451la9/nv_crossing_the_border_at_area_51_and_the/

So it has taken the better part of a year, but I have managed to unfuck myself with the feds. 

First I got an FBI NICS UPIN issued. This means no more 3 day waits when purchasing firearms. Can walk right in and buy my AK, and 45 minutes later lay hate down range at paper. 

The TSA known traveler number is a godsend too. This has stopped the harassment by the TSA completely. Last five times I have flown, I did not have to have any special screening. Just ran my bags through the xray and wanded. I no longer experience the sensation of a cold pen and a hot light in my backside. 

The passport situation actually resolved itself when I got the UPIN. Can't really explain it as when I got the new one; it came in the mail 2 weeks later. Normally it would take months for a new one to come in. 

I have only been stopped once since my last post by the police. They did ask me about my area 51 story and let me off with a warning. I see this one as a blessing. When they run my background check they see the trespassing at groom lake. 

They wanna know the story and I do not mind telling it.Plus I have spiced it up over and over again when talking with officials/HR when applying for a job that it sound incredibly interdasting. They take the strange story and let me go with a warning. 

Mostly posting this as a warning to anyone reading. Obey those damn signs and do not fuck around with the security at Area 51. It will not go well. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6cw5s3/update_consequences_of_crossing_the_border_at/,legaladvice,1464,1,
hossspitaaal,2017-05-23 05:54:20+00:00,Update. Am I liable to pay my son's friend's hospital bill? [Spoiler: no],"[Original:](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/67cqvi/am_i_liable_to_pay_my_sons_friends_hospital_bill/?st=j2y5kdjh&amp;sh=e8d38411)

Shortly after my original post, my husband and I sat down with a lawyer to discuss the events and our potential liability for the hospital bill or whether or not any of our actions could be construed as neglectful. 

Josh's family had seemingly given up on pressuring us to pay the hospital bill. His mother began sending me texts implying that they had ""trusted us with his care"" and they could sue for ""everything we have"". Hence, the lawyer.

Basically, they have nothing (as far as our lawyer is concerned). We're definitely not liable to pay the hospital bill, and neither the hospital nor any collection agency has contacted us since. Josh's mother attempted to state that we had spoken on the phone and I had agreed to keep an eye on her son, but her first text message to my phone (after the incident) states ""I just got your number from (other child's parent), we need to speak"". We are also looking into having our phone records pulled. 

My son told me that he told Josh that he could sleep over, but neither of them wanted to ask either myself or my husband because that would have ruined their chances of sneaking out to drink. Our lawyer had him write out the series of events. On top of that, there is a text record of Josh texting him apologizing for how his parents are acting and basically admitting that we had never known he was sleeping at our house. 

So...kind of a boring update, but we're just waiting to see if the family will sue. Our lawyer does not think it would be easy for them to do so without shelling out the money themselves for their own counsel, as it is not a ""cut and dry case"" that a lawyer would take on pro bono (not sure if I'm using the phrase correctly there, but you get my point). 

Best thing about this entire situation: Josh and my son have decided to remain friends. He is not a bad kid, just a kid who made a stupid decision to drink too much. I hope that we can have him over to our home again, but our lawyer has recommended that we do not invite him over at the moment. 

And if you are wondering what kind of punishment I have concocted, my son will be 15 soon and eligible to spend the summer working a crappy job to pay us back for some of the legal fees we've incurred. He will still be allowed to spend time with friends and generally enjoy his summer, but I think this is a good way to introduce him to the harsh and expensive realities of consequences of your actions.

Minjinz,2017-05-22 10:14:12+00:00,[NY] We are in a consensual incestuous relationship. Potential legal problems now and after possible marriage?,"This is a lot more complicated that it seems. So all I ask is to please read and understand it from our perspective.

My sister and I are 1 year apart. When I was 2 (she was 1), our biological parents died. We were each adopted by their friends. They raised as their biological kids and never told us that we were adopted. Families had some contact with each other, we saw each other probably 2-3 times a year, but not more. Nobody ever told us that we were siblings. Hell. None of the relatives even knew. Only our parents and one sibling who kept this secret from us.

I really liked her in the limited meetings that we had, so I asked her out when I was 17. We dated for a while. When I was 19, we decided that it's time to tell our families about each other. We thought it'd be cool. And when we told them they freaked the hell out, telling us the truth. By that time we had already been together for two years, had sex many times and considered ourselves a couple. Now it's been six months since we know of the past and still struggle with how to go ahead.

We want to stay together and have been thinking about how we can make this work. Given that only 5 people know of this, we thought that it can be kept the secret. But I also assume the people who worked out the adoption also know? Not sure if that is going to be a problem or not. Also I assume some people from the biological family might know, although they live in Europe.

Let's say we stay together. Obviously we will need to adopt children as we shouldn't have biological kids with each other. But in case of getting married and living together, are we actually committing any crimes here? And what are the potential legal consequences? Is there something we need to work out in advance to make this work? If we were to actually file for a marriage license at some point, will that be granted or will they know that we're siblings through their systems or whatever? I guess I just need advice on the legal ramifications of staying together and potentially getting married down the road.

I want to run away now, but am wondering about things concerning my passport and citizenship.","Hi /r/legaladvice, I have been putting this update off for a long time, but I think I need to give it now.

This is the [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5e432h/my_parents_brought_me_to_the_country_where_i_was/).

I made it back home! I've been here for just over two months now. After I made the OP, I was very anxious and not sure how to go about everything because I knew all my options, for example, selling my gold or just contacting the Embassy. In the end, I decided to contact the Embassy. I called them twice but both times the number went to voicemail, and I never got a call back. That made me feel kinda hopeless, until I talked to someone I really trust who suggested to email them. And I did.

The Embassy helped me out so fucking much. They were nice, helpful, and understanding. I was getting a little freaked out in the middle of the whole process because I needed at least three people to give to the Embassy as the people who can help me and I only had two. So I got desperate and went on /r/Assistance, and I don't know what to say about that. I guess people need to take care of themselves first, which I understand. I guess what I can say is that I wasn't being forced to marry, and I had a support system with my parents enough to let me survive, but I don't think merely surviving was the aim of my life. I don't think it ever will be. Nevertheless, I found my last person to help from a friend I've known for an incredibly long time.

After I had all the legal stuff figured out, I realized that my mom relocated the passports and stuff because we got our house refurnished. I was a mess, and I'm pretty sure the anxiety gave me physical sickness because I was not in good shape. Luckily, literally like two days before my flight, I finally found my passport and OCI card. I started packing right away and managed to keep everything hidden from my mom and sister. Goddamn, was it a mess though. My grandmother was sick the week before my flight and we went over to her house every night for a week and spent the night, so I didn't know how I was gonna get out of the house in the middle of the night, get my suitcase and catch my flight. But my mom decided to not go there the day before and the day of my flight, so I had a way, I guess. I booked a cab ahead of time and got everything sorted out. And I left. I also had to figure out where I was going to stay and for a while considered woman's shelters. My friend looked into it for me and said it was hard for me to get a spot in one of those because I needed to be there for the whole process and I was in India. My other friend let me stay with her for a few days when I got back here.

I really think something was looking out for me the whole time because when I got on my connecting flight, I realized the guy next to me was going to the exact same city I was going and he really helped me out.

I started working almost as soon as I got back home and I got offered a full time position at my job, and now...I'm just trying to stand on my feet. But I couldn't have done it without all the people who helped me along the way.

Although, I think my relationship with my parents is going downhill very fast and I am almost no contact with them. Good for me, I suppose. Right now, I am seriously considering going to therapy and talking about all this shit with a professional to help me sort out the objective parts of my life. My parents want me to come to India for Ramadan, and I am so fucking hesitant. I don't know how they have the audacity to come and ask me for their time in the country I fled from for a life of my own.

Anyway, in the OP, I guess some people were interested in how old I am, I mean I'm 20, but I think toxic culture is toxic to everyone who doesn't appreciate their environment, no matter how old they are. I don't have my shit together right now, and I didn't before, and I don't think I will in the near future. But that's life, maybe. You have to have cracks in the wall, forcing you to repair them to make your foundation stronger.  I have no idea, but I know that if I keep talking, it'll be beyond the scope of this sub.

Obviousanonforla,2017-05-15 15:44:50+00:00,TX - Roommate took a shotgun to his computer as a search warrant was being issued.,"A few days ago I answered the door to see police at the door. They tried coming in but I initially refused until they showed me a warrant. 

I guess my roommate saw what was happening and went into his room. The next thing I knew I hear a shotgun coming from his room. I turn to look but was quickly thrown down to the ground and cuffed. 

I was on the ground for a bit until I saw a wolf spider crawling across the ground towards my face. I freaked out and an officer stepped on it. I was immediately picked up and they set me on the couch. 

They immediately told me that I was not under arrest but that they wanted me to come down to talk with them. I refused at first until they told me that they were there for my roommate and that I was not in trouble. 

While talking I saw police officers pull a computer that had an obvious hole in it from where it was shot. Sad part is my idiot roommate didn't even shoot the hard drive. He shot the center and destroyed the motherboard. 

Long story short is I followed to the police station and initially started to answer questions. I say initially because I answered two questions. If I were injured from being handcuffed and how long I had known my roommate. 

After that they asked me something like. ""Have you ever noticed your roommate display any strange sexual behaviors?"" I answered with ""how should I know"" and they asked me if I had ever seen anyone young looking. I immediately shut up. 

Now I have never actually seen anyone young looking like he asked but then again I never really paid my roommate any attention. I did not speak again for the two hours they had me in there other than asking for water and to pee. 

They let me go and I came back to my place ransacked. My PS4, XBox one, old non working laptop, old cell phone, and other various electronics are gone. All of my roommates electronics are gone as well. They left the TV and the cable box though. 

I had my current laptop in my car when they searched my place. Since the warrant named my roommate they searched his car but not mine. SO I still have my laptop. 

Couple of questions here. 

One is the rent is due soon and they left the envelope that had the cash in it. Can I still legally use this money for his half of the rent?

When can I expect to get my stuff back? The warrant was for any electronics in the apartment or his car. But they took my stuff too. 

Will I legally be required to turn over my laptop to them if they asked for it? If yes will I break any laws if I nuke the hard drive? (Program that does multiple reformats of the drive. Even a lab could not produce anything off of it.)",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6bb5bh/tx_roommate_took_a_shotgun_to_his_computer_as_a/,legaladvice,1269,240,
hipaaviolthrowaway,2017-05-15 08:11:34+00:00,My SO's ex accessed my medical records and is telling people about my surgery [OH],"I recently got plastic surgery. It's a very not-obvious surgery (only visible while naked, and I have not seen her or posted any photos of myself since before the surgery). Boyfriend is also the only person aware I had this procedure done. So he was shocked when his ex made a snide comment about it while they were at an event with shared friends. A few of her friends piled on, so it's clear multiple people have been let in on this private information.

She's worked for the hospital at which I had my procedure for around a decade, but not at the location where my surgery was performed and in an entirely unrelated role. It's pretty clear to me she accessed my medical records, or had a friend do it (she used to have a friend at work access boyfriend's medical records when she wanted to make him go to the doctor or whatever so she wouldn't get in trouble).

Ideally, it will be pretty clear that she read my medical file once it's reported, but I'm not sure who to report it to or who will be punished. It's not really the doctor's fault as much as it is hospital policy and her unprofessionalism, but I'm pretty pissed she was able to gain access to it at all. She's in a customer service/clerical type role, helping enroll people in a specific program within a specific dept. I had never been to her hospital location, let alone her department, or had any issues in the past to indicate I would need to be in contact with them.

My questions are:
1. Who do I talk to about this first? A lawyer, or the doctor's office, or do I just file an official complaint?
2. I am sure she'll get fired, but will she end up able to get a job at any other hospital or will she get some kind of mark on her record? Will she be punished in any other way?
3. Will the hospital/doctor be fined?
4. Is there any sort of damages for me now that my medical information has been outed like that to so many people, or is it just, ""sorry, it happens, better luck next time!"" (other than the satisfaction of knowing they canned her)?

TL;DR: SO's ex-girlfriend told several people I had plastic surgery, I'm pretty certain she got that information by violating HIPAA to access my files while she was at work. Who do I talk to about it? What happens to her/the hospital/the doctor? Is it possibly to successfully sue her/the hospital for the shit I'm putting up with because of her, despite the fact that there are no monetary losses over it?",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6b95if/my_sos_ex_accessed_my_medical_records_and_is/,legaladvice,1079,186,

I live in Utah and am currently going through divorce. My wife met a guy at the gym, realized I wasn't worth the effort and he was great, so she divorced me. Only problem is that I found out that he's a registered sex offender. He told her that it was just a picture of a seventeen year old, but the news article detailing his arrest stated that there were multiple images and a video of *prepubescent girls*. I currently have two prepubescent girls and a prepubescent boy so this scares the everliving fuck out of me. He is a very charasmatic, attractive dude so of course she believes him. He even has a certificate saying he's not a danger to anyone or whatever. I don't care. I need to know for sure what went down. Is there any way to request his arrest record or find out the evidence used in his criminal case? I don't want to take the kids away from my wife but if they're bringing someone into the kid's life who could even possibly hurt them I'm going to do whatever it takes legally to get them away. I can't allow them to be hurt that way. Any advice would help. Thanks.

EDIT: Thank you everyone for your advice. I will be continuing to find any pertinent documents myself before hiring an attorney or PI to do that. She can't introduce him to the kids for another eight months due to custody agreement (hopefully she even follows that). Regardless of what I find, I will not be tipping her of when I decide to take sole custody. This man can never be in my children's life, not matter how ""reformed"" he is.

blacktiger226,2017-05-13 04:35:05+00:00,"(Georgia, US) [Update] Happy Ending: My friend was accused of academic dishonesty based on his perfect answers in grad school exams. Today, the investigation committee dropped all charges and sent him an apology letter.","[Original Post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6a8trh/my_friend_is_accused_of_academic_dishonesty_by/) [Update 1.](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6ahaj5/georgiaus_update_my_friend_is_about_to_get/)

I am writing this post to help any students who find themselves in this terrible situation. In response to the meeting described in update 1, he sent the committee an e-mail with the following:

&gt;Dear members of the committee,

&gt;I would like to know my rights as a student, whom should I go for guidance? Will there be anymore meetings to discuss the ""evidence"" that Dr. X presented? Should I be contacting my lawyer to take legal action? You keep mentioning a process, I would like to be detailed about the specifics of this process if possible so that I can have the full opportunity to defend myself, preferably in the presence of a legal representative.

&gt;I have absolutely nothing to hide and I wish that my answer sheets become public for everyone to see. The procedure in other universities is for any academic dishonesty claim to be reviewed by an academic honesty panel, comprised of professors and students, is this the process here too?

They replied with a copy of the school policy that included a 4 step appeal process but said that no lawyer is allowed to attend such hearings. Later that day we went (I go with him because he sometimes find it difficult to speak when he gets emotional) and met with two faculty members from outside the investigating committee, both were very supportive expressing that this situation was outrageous and should never happen. They both said that they can't do anything directly to interfere but they promised to try to contact the grad school to get more info, which at least one of them did.

The same day he got a request for a follow up meeting with the investigating committee, who asked him about whether he had access to the exam questions before the test, which he firmly denied. I attended the meeting with him, and I pleaded with them to carefully consider before taking a decision that could ruin someone's life. I also explained how it is typical for the best students in our country of origin to be able to memorize the course materials and regurgitate them in the test.

Next morning, my friend went and met with the University Advocate, a professor appointed by the university to help students who are facing similar difficult situations. He was outraged by how this all went and called the school and ordered them to provide him with a copy of the school's policy of honor and that there will be serious repercussions if they didn't respond promptly. He also promised my friend to attend future hearings with him, stating that my friend should be able to have any number of legal representatives with him.

Few hours later he received the following e-mail from the investigation committee: 

&gt;We have concluded that there is no preponderance of evidence that cheating occurred. We apologize for any distress that you experienced and hope you understand that it was necessary for us to go through this process in response to multiple reports of cheating in the course. 

------------------------------

Bottom line: I would like to advice any students (especially international students) who get stuck in similar situations to reach out to members of the faculty, university advocates or their colleagues for advice and help. I don't know if these interventions were helpful in the case of my friend or if their case was weak from the beginning, but what I know that he got asked to the follow up meeting 1 hour after we left the office of a prominent faculty member and got the letter of apology 1 hour after leaving the office of the university advocate.

You don't have to and you shouldn't face such situations alone, have someone advise you and stand by your side and never try to face it alone or keep it secret. The more people who get involved the more pressure on the investigating committee to be very careful with their decisions and thorough with their investigation.

--------------------------------

One last thing I want to say, I reached out for this sub for help and my posts were downvoted and most comments that I got were saying ""Your friend is a liar, he cheated."" This is the first time that I was let down by reddit when seeking help. I would advise people who comment here to be supportive and try to provide advice assuming that the situation is actually as described by the OP. This way you will help OP and people in similar situations reading the post. Otherwise, don't comment. Commenting that OP is a liar actually doesn't help anybody.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6aw3cs/georgia_us_update_happy_ending_my_friend_was/,legaladvice,1904,1,
GotYourPackage,2017-05-11 20:43:09+00:00,5th grade son's nurse and food allergies (AZ),"Sorry this will be short and to the point as I'm on lunch. My 5th grade son has egg allergies which are pretty severe. The school and old nurse have known about it and has worked with him before to make sure Benadryl is given immediately to alleviate the symptoms before they get worse. He normally gets stomaches aches, diarrhea, and vomiting. He does have an EpiPen, but​ has never had to use it because he's quickly gotten Benadryl before it got that bad.

Well today, at morning recess, he had a laffy Taffy. Normally, they are fine, except a few of the larger size ones have eggs. This one did. He's 11, and knows what it feels like when he eats something he's allergic to. He checked the wrapper and confirmed it had eggs. He left the wrapper and went to the office, and informed her. First, she sent him back to class to get a hall pass. Second, once he described what was going on as he was in pain and panicking, she told him to stop giving her attitude. Then she didn't believe laffy Taffy had eggs, so checked their website for ingredients. It's on his record to give him Benadryl immediately if he eats something he's allergic to. She then made him go back and find the wrapper, and bring him back. Once she has it, she calls my wife, and she goes to the school and gives him Benadryl. He's vomiting and having difficulty breathing. It's been about 30 min now after he first went to the nurse. My wife takes him to urgent care where he is given an EpiPen, and steroids. They tell her that he needs to go to the ER, then call an ambulance because he's still having difficulty breathing. So now it's 3 hours later and he's finally discharged. 

What are my options here? We have insurance, but now we have copays we normally wouldn't have had to pay had she just administered Benadryl like every nurse has ever done. This is her 2nd year at the school. I definitely plan on having a meeting with the principal asap, I'm just wondering if I can expect some kind of reimbursement to make up for the medical bills he'll have?

clipswhy,2017-05-10 15:43:55+00:00,CALIFORNIA. My sister spiked my drink with meth.,"Long story short, my sister came up dirty for meth and wanted to drag me to the bottom too so she spiked my drink and told me after. I have been sober for 10 years so I guess she wanted a level playing field. I don't know how to link on mobile but I posted to /relationships if you wanna check my history. 

I have texts from her admitting doing this. It doesn't outright say it but from the topic of conversation and her saying she regrets giving me the drink and how we are both dirty now, I think that it's pretty straightforward. I actually have 2 pee tests from myself. One that is completely clean from before my mom tested her so she could see what the lines looked like and one from after that shows I tested dirty. 

What can I do? Is it assault? 

But on to the important part that I'm more worried over. My sister has 2 children. These guys are my world. She has never been a great mom, so my mother and I have picked up the slack and then some. She had lost custody of them for a little while but got them back in November. If I press any charges against her, what happens to them? We barely got my niece back from her father after a lot of court visits and money. He ended up just signing her back over in the end because his wife didnt get along with her. Yeah, 2 shit parents. Would she automatically go back? When they got taken to foster care it was a traumatic experience so I really don't know how to navigate this.

    Help please

Sorry for not updating you right away as I was really impacted by the death of a very close person in my family.

So here’s what happened. I liked one of the comments here where it said to see if there is anyone who fly drones as a hobby willing to use his drone for me for a thousand dollar instead of me paying for a whole new drone, figured just like you guys said it would make someone’s day to fly a drone as a hobby and also get paid. So I hired a guy which I'll call him Frank.

After waiting for 3 days at my house every morning the drone finally flew to us but apparently when the other kid saw the other drone take off he went crazy and tried to hit it or take it down, which he did, which resulted in the kid’s drone and frank’s drone both to go down broken on the ground. 

A few minutes later this kid came running to the house (whom I recognized lives a couple of blocks away) and started whining about how we flew our drone in his way and crashed it bla bla bla. We went and spoke to his dad and showed him all the footage and explained all the shit his son has caused. Shockingly he was completely understanding. He told me he would put me through one of his lawyers so that they would offer both Frank and I a settlement if I agree not to sue. I called my lawyer and we all met a week later and he reimbursed Frank for his drone plus way more money that I would’ve ever paid him. He also wrote me a check for what his son has caused under the condition that I wont pursue any legal action.

It was a happy ending and I was quite shocked of his father’s reaction and his willingness to pay for everything his son has caused, but I must admit that I feel sad knowing that his dad is definitely the one enabling him to do so. Never have I felt his dad was mad about anything his son did. While we were there discussing what happened his dad received a phone call and then shortly after ending it he started telling his son what the other party was saying and they both started making jokes about the caller! So the whole thing made me feel that his dad was like “mehhh just another day, my son caused damage and I’ll just have to pay those people here for this to go all away”.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/69z6d0/update_this_mankid_keeps_flying_a_drone_over_my/,legaladvice,14314,1,

This was done as part of a form for a state wide nomination. I consented to be nominated, but never said it was okay to disclose that information, did not know that information was part of the form, and was not told the nomination was shown to anyone but other teachers. This information was sent in a link to my classmates, other teachers around the state.

I first asked the teacher to remove the form from ojline, they said no. I went to the schools FERPA officer that is shown in the handbook and asked for this information to be removed, and that if It wasn't I would file a FERPA complaint. (Asked teacher two Fridays ago and FRRPA officer last Monday. I also only asked for the info to be removed and only said that if it wasn't I would file a formal FERPA complaint.). This Friday I was hauled into the principal's office who told me that they found no FERPA violation (because the teacher never said what the info was, just released it). They also informed me that since they found no violation if I reported it on the FERPA form they would stop me from walking at graduation

evenmoresuicidal,2017-05-06 17:29:19+00:00,[New mexico USA] A suicide hotline notified the police to check me after I finished talking to them. The police showed up and I was involuntarily taken to the hospital in an ambulance. Is the hotline repsonsible for my medical bills?,"About a month ago, I reached out to a suicide hotline because I was having a particularly bad night. I spoke with an operator for some time about my situation.

during this time, the only thing I said to them is that I had self-harmed in the past(3-4 years ago) and had been having a hard time keeping myself from doing it again. I told the worker that I had driven to a nearby McDonalds parking lot before making the call to get out of the house and keep myself from doing anything stupid.

After talking and feeling a little better about my situation  I ended the call, and drove back home. it was probably 10:30PM.

I went to bed once I got home, and at about 2 AM the police showed up, asking if I had called the hotline. I didn't want to lie to the police, so I explained that I had, but had ended the call because I was feeling better about my situation. I was very disoriented and tired because it was 2AM and I had just woken up to them pounding on my door. One of the officers informed me they would be calling an ambulance to make sure I was ok. I informed him I didn't need medical attention but he repeatedly told me it was ""policy"" and if I was checked out by EMS and everything was okay they would be on their way.

EMS came, took vitals, shined a light in my eye, and talked with the police for about 15 minutes. After they finished their convesation, EMS informed me I'd need to go to the hospital. The police suspected that I had taken something and tried to overdose? even though I truthfully told them I hadn't taken any medication, and was just tired.

 I asked if I could just go back to bed because I felt fine, and they told me at that point it was not voluntary. I didn't make a scene but did ask if I could have a family member drive me to the hospital instead of taking the ambulance, and was told no. I didn't want the police restraining me or something stupid so I got into the ambulance on my own.

Once I got to the hospital I was put under observation and had to submit blood and urine tests. these tests came back clean of any drugs legal or otherwise. once a social worker showed up 7 hours after admission, I was cleared to go back home. She spent maybe 30 minutes with me and basically said ""I really don't see any reason to keep you, you seem like you aren't a threat to yourself, you're just going through a lot, I recommend getting into counseling and seeing your primary care doctor to look into treatment options for your depression.""

I am now faced with a $1400 ambulance bill, and a $870 hospital bill. I do not have insurance, I am not employed currently, and I have no way of paying.

Can this hotline legally be held responsible for the charges as a result of them contacting the police? I asked every step of the way if I could please just go back to sleep, or decline a trip to the hospital. I was told no, and that it was involuntary.

I wanted to update in case anyone finds themselves in a similar situation. Thank you so much for all of your kind words and very good advice in the original post, you guys are the greatest. 

Most importantly, kiddo is doing great and has returned to normal teenage levels of hating me, life, the world, etc! He has his head on straight and is just ready for this whole mess to blow over. I think the most helpful thing has been to fill his time with new activities, friends (read: girls) and staying busy. The therapists kicked us out about a week ago and feel that no lasting harm has been done and to just keep communication open and a watchful eye out. We are so damn thankful!

It's been a almost 2 months since we first spoke to the detective. He sent me a message today saying that the case was progressing albeit slowly, but they are continuing to move forward. I have not heard anymore from the DA and I'm not sure if they have interviewed the ex-family friend yet. The detective and DA have kept tabs on my son and have received progress notes from the family advocacy team - everybody has, and continues to be, a huge support for us and we couldn't be more pleased with all the help we've been provided. 

Sorry that it's not a huge update but I want to leave this as a timeline resource for anyone else in the future. It was difficult to find information like this online and I will continue to update to the conclusion of the case, should the mods allow of course!

TheWalkingSled,2017-05-03 07:15:40+00:00,"[VERMONT / MAINE] Some kid stole my sister's phone, which exploded in the child's possession, and now the kid's parent is trying to sue us for injuries","Yes this is an extremely weird situation. Here's the backstory:

My sister [lives in Maine] bought a shitty Chinese phone from Aliexpress a year ago. Up until today she had no problems with it at all (that she remembers, she isn't great with tech). She is visiting me [live in Vermont] for a few weeks. 

This afternoon I smelled something metallic in the kitchen and asked if she knew what it was. She said she didn't know. I noticed a little bit of clear smoke coming from her purse and realize her phone was smoking. We panic a little bit and put the phone outside on my door step and start trying to fan the fumes out and looking a glass container and baking soda. A few seconds later we go back outside and see the phone is missing and see some kid running down the street. I immediately run into the street and scream ""BRING THE PHONE BACK! IT'S ON FIRE! IT'S NOT SAFE! YOU'RE GOING TO GET HURT! PLEASE BRING IT BACK!""

We call 911 and tell them what happened. We tell them that phone was smoking and a fire hazard and chemical hazard (li-on battery). They say they're going to send the police out to look for the kid and a fire truck out and ambulance as well. An officer eventually shows up and questions us while other officers look for the kid. We don't hear anything else for awhile. 

Fast forward a few hours later and a very angry woman shows up at my door. She says her son ""found the phone in the middle of the street"" and wanted to do the right thing and bring it back to us. But it burst into the flames the second he picked it up. He had to go the hospital for smoke inhalation and burns to his hands and arms. She says she's going to sue my sister for endangering a child, emotional suffering, and have her pay all of the hospital fees. She says she's also going to specifically sue me over the fact that the phone was on my property as she claims the explosion happened here in my front yard.

I haven't actually seen her son since he's still in the hospital but her ethnicity matched that of the kid I saw running away with the phone earlier, so I know for a fact that he didn't just ""find it in the middle of the street."" My doorstep is also 20 feet from the sidewalk adjacent to the street so that's another thing going for me. It also definitely didn't explode in on my property. I would have heard and saw that. Sadly I don't have an outdoor camera that caught this.

What do we do? We're panicking now. We have a meeting with a lawyer tomorrow but we're still scared. 

Without video evidence I'm really worried that everyone will side with the kid and his mom. So far no other witnesses have come forward. It's just me, my sister, and the child. I'm really hoping that when the kid did wind up going to the hospital, they documented where and when he was picked up in the ambulance. That should be enough to show it didn't happen on my property, right? And possibly enough to show it was a theft?

I'm just so scared and confused for my sister right now. Any help would be appreciated. I know the lawyer is going to take care of it but it would be nice to have additional help and resources.

(South Carolina),"I've gotten several requests for an update to this over the last few months, but its so unsatisfying a really didn't have the heart. 

 Laura went to jail in February. She defrauded one of our clients out of 10k and is looking at a max of 5 years in prison. 

Henry's father has custody of him now and from what I hear he's made a full recovery. 

I don't know if Henry's father will continue the case as his new sole guardian or not. I haven't had contact or updates since Laura was walked out of the office when the fraud was discovered.

I can say the daycare lost its accreditation and was forced to close by the state. Its no longer in business and from what I understand the owner is banned from ever operating an accredited daycare in the state ever again. 

So there's that at least.

StrangeHomeBuilder,2017-04-30 21:16:16+00:00,"California - My house burnt down, I'm being threatened by the home builder for infringing on their IP because it is being rebuilt.","This is in cookie cutter suburbia, in California.

The overall story is a bit messy, so I will keep this as short and to the point as possible. 

My homeowners insurance is helping me out here, so I ""have a lawyer"" but I wanted to see what you folks thought of this, as I have a phone meeting with my insurance company's lawyer tomorrow.

Here's what's going on:

* My house burnt down early this year. Total loss. No one was injured, but all my personal belongings are just gone.
* The source of the fire was electrical related (not my fault). The fire department said it was likely a charging lithium battery (my homeowners insurance is dealing with that situation) 
* The house is only 3 years old. 
* I purchased the house brand new, had some semi-custom things done to it, and actually had a great time with the home builder


Two months ago, once the dust settled, I reached out to the home builder (who is well known) to see how we could acquire the blueprints for my home...or at a minimum, the blueprints for my model. I also inquired about how I could engage them to rebuild my home as I am not planning on moving out of this neighborhood (I really like it here). 

They took my info and said that they would get back to me. A few days later I heard from them regarding me/my insurance hiring them to rebuild. They said they are not set up for that and would like to help, but could not...bummer, but no big deal. I once again inquired about the blueprints. They said they would have to get back to me.

Eventually they got back to me after several days and said that they would not release the blueprints to me as they are their intellectual property. Serious bummer, but whatever...

My insurance company found a local reputable home builder and they started the rebuild 5 weeks ago. 

Last week I got a cease and desist letter (with a threat to sue) form the original home builder saying that I/we were infringing on their intellectual property, they specifically called out the design of the house. Basically they know (due to the home being in an HOA) that the house will be designed back to the exact way it was before the home burned down.

Soooooo, I have a meeting tomorrow with my homeowners insurance lawyer regarding this situation. 

Have any of you ever heard of such a crazy situation? What can I expect out of this situation? My agent said she has never encountered anything like this before and she's dealt with tons of total losses for homes that get rebuilt.

Does the original home builder have any legal legs to stand on here?",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/68hwlr/california_my_house_burnt_down_im_being/,legaladvice,4103,394,

texas-dad,2017-04-27 00:22:58+00:00,[Update] we got our repo'd car back today! [TX],"Last night, I posted this question on /r/legaladvice:

[Car repo'd 7 months later due to previous owner's title loan. What should I do?](https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/67l02u/tx_car_repod_7_months_later_due_to_previous/)

I'm happy to report that we got it back a few hours ago, in no small part due to an intrepid DMV clerk who took the matter personally!  We showed up this morning at our local office to obtain the full title history, for the file we were putting together for an eventual attorney.

After we explained the problem, and after reviewing the records himself, Mr. DMV asked if we had contact info for the title loan company.  Somewhat bewildered, I gave him their phone number.  He called and told them they had technically stolen our car, and needed to return it to us.  I could only make out his end of the conversation, but the person on the other end of the call got noticeably louder after that statement.  The call ended with the other end yelling, and hanging up on Mr. DMV!   We left with our certified title history, and a few hours later we got a call asking us where we'd like the vehicle delivered.   

*&lt;likeaboss.jpg&gt;*

**So how'd this all happen in the first place, you ask?**  As best as I can reconstruct from the title history...

1. Previous Owner (PO) put the title up as collateral for a loan 6 years ago, and paid that off **5 years ago**.
2. Subsequently, the Title-Loan Company (TLC) signed the lien-release portion of the Original Title (OT), and gave it back to PO.   *(That OT ended up being the one that PO surrendered to my son last year, when he bought the car for cash.  My son then himself surrendered it to the DMV when he registered the car in his name... and our DMV then sent us a free-and-clear New Original Title (NOT)... which is the one that made it clear to the DMV clerk today that my son was the current lawful owner.)*
3. **Four years ago**, TLC sends in an ""Application for Certified Copy of Title"" (AoCCT).  The best-fit explanation I can think of, is that they possibly forgot to expunge their records of PO's paid-off loan, and assumed they had misplaced the title.  In fact I am reasonably certain that's what happened, because their AoCCT referenced the Title Document # of the OT that the PO gave my son.
4.  Now, in 2017, it appears that someone at TLC found that dusty CCT behind a desk or something, and decided it must certainly still be their property, and therefore they naturally must go retrieve it from whomever and wherever, ASAP.   But their CCT is now void, because our (free and clear!) NOT supersedes it.

Un.  Freaking.  Believable.

Overgenfd,2017-04-22 12:55:43+00:00,[Pennsylvania] Husband is divorcing me over sons asthma. He only wants to see our daughter and not our son.,"**This is the post I posted on Relationships explaining what Happened.**

I'm a little in shock. I've stayed up all night and I can't believe it. It completely blind sided me. I thought we had a good relationship. I guess my soon to be ex husband and I have 2 children. A three year old son and 1 year old daughter.

I got home from work last night and he had a suitcase with him. He flat out told me to not fight this. He's done with the marriage. He told me it's nothing to do with me. This part is disgusting, but he said he never wanted a child with any type of disability. Our children are perfectly healthy. The only real issue we have is my sons Asthma. Nothing else. You'd never know when he's playing with his friends or when you see him in the mall with me. He told the Asthma is to much for him to mentally deal with, and he's leaving me. He left with his suitcase.

He told me I can have sole custody of our son, but he wants to see our Daughter. I have no idea what to do. How do I even explain this to our son if he get's what he wants? Will the court grant this? What he's proposing has to be some sort of Mental abuse. It's going to drive a huge wedge between the kids. I don't know what to do. 

**The Question**

Can he actually do this? He wants me to have Sole Custody of our son and only have visitation to our daughter. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/66vt6i/pennsylvania_husband_is_divorcing_me_over_sons/,legaladvice,1527,174,

Sure enough, they had one in my name opened in January 2016 with my ex as an authorized user. The statements go to her house and there is a balance of over $6,000 on it. They also told me there have been multiple 30 day late payments and a 60 day late payment. At my request, they cancelled the card and told me I need to talk to the police or a lawyer.

SilentThrowaway13,2017-04-19 02:49:42+00:00,"I'm a minor in the US. Can my mother force me to undergo cochlear implant surgery? And if she can, is there anything I can do to fight it?","I am a minor in the US, more specifically North Carolina. I am 13, and I am going Deaf (the capital D matters, more on that later). My mother wants me to continue hearing at all costs, even the robotic, bastardized version that a cochlear implant would give. My parents divorced two years ago, and although it was a ""nice"" divorce, my mom fought for and received full custody. That means my father has no formal say in my medical decisions. She wishes for me to get cochlear implants, despite my protests. I have asked if she would force it on my against my will, and she said because it was her duty to ""do the best she can for me"" and not let me become ""damaged"" (ie, disabled). 

I don't even know if she can actually do that, force me into a surgery completely against my will. We don't have a doctors recommendation yet, but considering I don't hear jet planes at all, or speech, it's pretty obvious. I was born with Pierre-Robins syndrome which caused an airway blockage so I had a tracheostomy for three years. Because of that, I was taught American Sign Language. I am still fluent, and able to communicate. My entire family is fluent and already uses it with me.

Now onto why I don't want one

1. I've got severe sleep apnea, so surgical procedures are very high risk for me (I might stop breathing and never start again)

2. I know what a a cochlear implant sounds like, I've heard it (before I lost my hearing) and honestly it sounds AWFUL. Everything's robotic and distorted, and I'll never hear music or many sounds at the time ever again in their true state. I'd rather not hear at all

3. I'm part of the capital D Deaf community, and we see our deafness not as a hearing loss, but a Deaf gain. There's nothing wrong with me, I just can't hear. So why do I need to be ""fixed"" against my will?

4. The surgery will destroy my cochlea. If there are ever breakthroughs in medical science and my health or my genetic sydrome can be improved by fixing my damaged organs (cochlea, joints, nose, face), my cochlea will be utterly destroyed and unfixable. I'd rather have an undamaged if nonfunctional cochlea.

5. I just don't want another surgery for gods sake! I've had over 15 surgeries to ""fix"" problems that weren't really problems (and I'll admit, some that were) and I'm sick of it! I want to go six months without going under the knife, would that be too much to ask?

And, to close off, if she does force me, do I have any options? Can I fight it?

Original Post:

I'm 42, she's 35 we were married in 2002 in Michigan. We have two kids that I am the biological father of. In 2010 we kinda sorta separated, she moved to Arizona and I stayed in Michigan. The original intention was that I would move to Arizona eventually. While in Arizona she got a new boyfriend and got pregnant by him. That child was born in 2012. In 2013 she and all three kids moved back to Michigan. We never got back together, I have never lived with her since she moved back. I never lived under the same roof as this new child, I never acted like his father, I want nothing to do with him. Apparently the child's biological father doesn't want anything to do with him either. So now I'm trying to fill out paperwork on my own for a DIY divorce and while I'm at the website LawHelpInteractive.org filling out the divorce paperwork. I just got served court papers from my wife and MDHHS for child support on all three kids. I have been paying her child support that I calculated using an online calculator for two kids. $170 a week. I'm venting but I'm also lost and could use any advice. I know I need a lawyer, I actually talked to two recently, they both wanted about $3000 up front to start the divorce. I don't have any money. I live paycheck to paycheck and have less than $100 right now.

UPDATE:

I didn't get a lawyer.  I filed for the divorce on my own.  I also sent a letter to the assistant prosecuting attorney that is representing my ex and the State of Michigan in the case for child support.  I told him that I filed for divorce in another county and I requested that he drop his case and that the matter of child support be handled through the divorce process.  He rejected my request.  Today we went before the judge.  The assistant prosecuting attorney asked the judge to order me to pay child support on all three kids, including the child that is not mine.  I told the judge that I have filed for divorce in another county and that I intend to file a motion to revoke my paternity of the child that I am not the biological father of.  The judge sided with me and ordered that I DO NOT have to pay child support for the child that I am not the biological father to.

I still have to go through with the divorce process, our first hearing with that case is in three weeks.

Cliffs: My store was burgled of a revolver. The thief ran, got pulled over and then in a chase, fled to his home, was surrounded, eventually came out shooting and was killed. The firearm had been the one he'd taken from me and was taken as evidence.

**Update**: I was informed in June the case had been closed. I had not heard back from them, so this past month I really wanted to track it down, find exactly where it was, the judge who presided over the case, etc... basically do all the things I probably should have done from the start, but didn't because I was told to be patient and wait. 

I wasn't getting anywhere, the local receptionist at the Texas Ranger's office would not return my calls. The Ranger I'd spoken with in the past would not either. I sent an email to the local detective I work with and asked her how I could go about seeing if their office had my firearm and she didn't get back with me either. I eventually called the main office in Austin and spoke with a woman. She took all my information and told me she'd send an email to the right people and that I should wait. I did. I got a call a couple days later from the Ranger who I'd spoken with last June and he says he's coming by Thursday to release the firearm.

So, I'm about to call the lady in Austin and thank her. Looks like I should be getting it back soon. Thank you for those of you who advised me to be diligent and follow up on calling about it. A lot of people told me to forget about it and that I'd never get it back, not gloating, but they were clearly wrong and probably talking out of their ass and not legal expertise.

**TLDR AT THE BOTTOM AS WELL**

And for the lazy who won't click the links, I'll give a quick overview of whats happening: Bought my first home in December, neighbor likes to call the cops for everything you can imagine, neighbor infringes on our privacy whenever we are outside and threatens to call the cops on us for no reason.

Now bear with me here, I don't have exact dates to go off of since I am at work and on my lunch break. I will guesstimate the best as possible with dates.

So we left my first update where me and my S/O caught our crazy neighbor lady in our front yard blowing leaves around. Nobody was home at the time and my S/O drove by the house and saw it. That's how we know. A lot of people suggested getting a security camera system and I said I would be getting one as soon as possible. Other financial issues came up and I had to put off the camera system for a few weeks.

This is where the **2nd update starts**. Fast forward from February to March 15th(?). It is around 9:45pm and I am out back smoking a cigarette. I see movement out of the corner of my eye and look over towards it and see this.... hand... throwing pieces of garbage into my yard over the fence. It's Crazy Neighbor Lady. She didn't know I was outside (just good timing on my part I guess). I played dumb and asked, ""What are you doing Crazy Neighbor Lady"" and she quick stops throwing the trash and quickly turns around to go inside of her house. As she gets closer to her door she turns around and says, ""I'm sorry, what did you say?"" With which I responded loudly, ""*What are you doing Crazy Neighbor Lady?*"" She says she was just outside checking out her yard... Now mind you, it's 9:45pm and it had just started to snow. We were projected to get 12+ inches of snow so I think her plan was to throw trash into my yard and then have it be covered up by the snow.

I went over to where I saw her hand coming over the fence and found a random piece of plastic and a soda lid (think of the ones that you get from fast food places with your drink. The kind you poke a straw through). They were laying neatly on top of the leaves and mulch bed that they were thrown on.

This had me LIVID. I caught her in the act and bought a security camera system that night on Amazon. It came within two days and I set it up over that weekend. 

I set all of the cameras up inside of windows looking out towards my property. It took only THREE DAYS of having the cameras to find her throwing more little pieces of trash onto our property. It's just little pieces of trash that end up in her yard. We live in a city along one of the busiest streets. It's unfortunate that people litter out of their cars but it happens. If I see any trash in my yard, I'll pick it up and throw it out. If Crazy Neighbor Lady sees any trash in her yard, she'll throw it into her neighbors yards so it's not her problem.

Over the period of a month I catch her 3 different times on camera throwing trash from her property on to mine. She physically picks it up, comes on to my property and sets it down well on to my side of the front yard when nobody is home. To some, it may sound like I'm going to the extremes to try and screw this lady over, but given her past history that I've heard from other neighbors, I'm stomping out the fire (her) before it (she) can even get started.

Last night, I catch her on camera for the 4th time coming on to my property to throw more trash into my yard. This time she has her dogs with her and are letting her dogs roam around without a leash in my yard. I had finally had enough and called the police to come out to look at my videos and see if there was anything I can do about her.

Police officer comes out looks at the videos and I read him the journal of all of the interactions of had with her and he's kind of blown away with all of the work I've put into protecting myself. My neighbor is a huge PITA for my city's police department (she'll make calls to them for things like the kids being too loud in the playground across the street from us.. unnecessary stuff) and they have no problem slapping her with charges if legitimate charges can be made.

I could have pressed charges against her for trespassing, littering and not having her dog on a leash, but I opted to just have the police officer go over to her house and give her a warning. I don't really have the time to take off from work to go to court. I told him to let her know that if she's ever caught on my property or throwing trash on to my property, then I will press charges. He was licking his chops to go over there and ream her ass out. The city police HATE her and like many others have probably mentioned, they take all of her calls with a grain of salt.

Now I'm just waiting to see what the next chapter has in store for me. I'm sure she was told that she has been caught on camera so I'll have to wait and see if she tries looking for my cameras. BTW these cameras are fun to watch. It's like I'm living next to a 61 year old child.

I am too scared to do anything for fear of retaliation. What are my rights?","Here are the facts: 

This is in Florida. 

Apartment complex buys water through water company on a master meter. 

They have installed individual meters in each of our apartments, and they have hired a third-party biller to calculate our water usage and then bill back to us. 

Water is a separate line item on our rent bill. It just says meter usage from one bill to the next, total usage per gallon, and amount for water and sewer. 

They will not accept rent unless water is included. 

Rates are higher than water company's rates, which is illegal in our state (you cannot make profit off a utility). Some months that have less usage have higher rates than months with higher usage. Numbers seem to be just made up out of thin air. 

They also charge an extra admin fee ever month, and bill is every 25 days. 

Apartment complex is not a utility company, nor regulated as such. 

There are no rates listed on the bill, we do not get a separate bill from utility company as we are not their customers. 

This billing arrangement is not listed in our lease, instead it says we will pay utility company directly. They started this new policy by informing us a month before with an email. No lease addendums were signed. 

Sub meters have not been tested to our knowledge. 

Management will not answer any questions or address it. Many residents are upset about the increase in price and refusal to address it, but too scared to do anything about it. 

Government state agencies including PUC, consumer affairs, county commissioners, dept of agriculture, attorney generals office etc., has been extremely unhelpful and a waste of time. Told us to just file a complaint and gave us no other recourse or guarantee itd even be pursued. But this is par for the course in this state. 

I found the contract the water company made the complex sign in order to sub meter, and they are violating many provisions including: they are not allowed to charge an admin fee, they cannot bill sooner than every 30 days, they cannot bill at a rate higher than the water company, that must put rates on bills, and sub meters have to be checked every few months for accuracy. 

Water company will accept complaint and if complex is in violation (which they are), will force them to be compliant, but will not advocate on behalf of residents to receive their illegally billed monthly fees and extra rates back. They said we have to pursue that privately. 

If we (roommates and I) make a complaint with the water company and PUC, it will become public knowledge and complex will find out. Although I know retaliation in this situation would be illegal, it would be very difficult to prove and this is a very bad state for consumer and tenant rights. The last thing we need is for them to make up a reason to evict us or retaliate by making up a reason not to return our deposit to upon move-out. However, we feel it is wrong to continue to let the complex get away with this. 

Should we make the complaint now or wait until after we have moved out and gotten our deposit back? They are billing us two months behind for water, so we will not get our deposit back (or what's left of it after they have upcharged us for two more months of water) until two months after we have moved out. 

If we wait until then, how do we get our wrongly charged fees and money that was upcharged back? Write a certified letter to them? Dispute it with the management company? Go to the news? 
Hire a lawyer to write a letter? Take them to small-claims? 
We just want our money back and can't afford a lawyer.

Or should we report this now while we still live here and have leverage or is it too risky?

Short update.

The neighbor had an accident on his property and will no longer be an issue.

His heir and I settled out of court.

The county is still figuring out how much the fines will be, but they will be quite sizable, and part of the settlement was the agreement that the neighbors estate will cover all fines due to the work.

This guy had his dog off leash while mine was on and his dog was whining at a distance at mine. At this point I will mention my dog is a pit bull with no aggressive tendencies, his looked to be a Queensland heeler. At a point where he was leaving my dog slipped his leash and approached his and began general dog stuff (jumping around, sniffing butts and the like) This gentleman kicks my dog in the ribs and draws his weapon (in a park with about 15 children under the age of 12) points it at my dog as I'm pulling it away and says to me ""your dog is about to get fucking shot"" after I pull my dog behind me I ask him what the deal was and he identified himself as an off duty peace officer (California department of corrections) and I ask for his badge number. He reluctantly gives me his badge and tries to angle it so I couldn't get a good picture. He then called the cops as we left saying my dog attacked him although he has no marks. My 7 year old son is now terrified to take the dog outside and thinks the cops are coming to shoot him. Do I have any legal recourse? Was drawing his weapon in this instance justified?

Side note: the gentleman in question is a prison guard, not a police officer. This happened in Kern County, CA

UPDATE: I have spoken with the local police dept and they said that drawing his weapon to defend himself was justified, however if he would've shot and there been no identifying marks on him or his dog to prove self defense it  could've moved to wreckless endangerment and ADW.

TXhotelthrowaway1984,2017-04-07 15:21:22+00:00,Hotel charging for eating Burger King in their room [TX],"Hi all,

I recently stayed at a major hotel chain for a few nights while attending a conference. On my last night there, I was too tired to go out for a proper dinner, so I grabbed Burger King and brought it back to the hotel room. Never imagined that it would turn into the debacle it has.

I checked out the following morning with no issues, but when I checked my credit card statement the charge was $250 more than I expected, so I called to see what the problem was. I talked to a manager who told me that they had charged me the smoking penalty fee because when they went to clean the room it smelled so strongly of grease. I swear to god I couldn't make this up.

We argued for a while, and he agreed I hadn't actually smoked in the room (I don't smoke anyway). I don't even disagree that eating fast food can leave a greasy odor for a day or so, but come on. I didn't spill anything and didn't do anything out of the ordinary in terms of eating the burger. You know the smell when you eat fast food in your car? That's literally all it was. This happened about a week ago, so I'm certain the smell would be gone whether they did anything about it or not.

The next day I called their customer service line and spoke with a representative. They told me the charge was up to the manager's discretion, even if I didn't technically smoke in the room. I told them I thought that was ridiculous and asked to speak to a manager, but the rep told me that was their policy. He was not able to direct me to anything where it says that in writing, although I did get a sheet when I checked in that said specifically ""no smoking"" (but nothing else, there was no other more abstract room cleaning fee mentioned). I ended the call after realizing it was going nowhere.

Is this legal? Is there anything I can do? I realize it may not seem like a lot of money, but I'm self employed so it does make a difference to me. It just seems insane that they could charge a smoking fee just for eating fast food in their room.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/64113z/hotel_charging_for_eating_burger_king_in_their/,legaladvice,1592,104,
Head_Haunter,2017-04-06 15:38:17+00:00,"[Update] A bit late, but here's my update","[This was my original inquiry](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/4yj8ar/advice_for_presenting_evidence_in_a_minor_traffic/)


My court date was actually last November so I'm quite late on the update, just had it on my check-list until now. 


Basically I went to court and claimed not guilty. They gave me a reduced fine and said it was a one-time offer. I said not guilty. They gave me a follow-up court date, which was the one in November. 


On that day, my ticketing officer did show up. At first, some of the court people were asking me if I was absolutely sure that I wanted to fight the ticket and if I was open to claiming nolo claim with a reduced rate. This was the same reduced fine that they presented me on my first court date, where they said it was a one-time offer. I said no and asked what the possible fines were if I was found guilty. The lady quoted me the maximum, which was like a **lot** of jail time and like $2,000 in fines or something. I still claimed not guilty. In hindsight I feel like she was trying to scare me into going nolo? Not sure. 


The court lawyer lady (not sure what she's called now that it has been so long) asked him questions to help him present his case on my ticket. Very reminiscent of TV court rooms, confirming dates, times, and details. 


When I presented the evidence, I didn't allude to my background or anything, as per suggestion from /r/legaladvice. Basically I just said: 



- The officer providing ground guidance for vehicles was unclear in his instructions

- There were multiple people ticketed for the same turn at the intersection

- The ticketing officer was not present or in the vicinity when the other officer was providing ground guidance



I did not sound very... er.... lawyer-y, but I didn't use slang, curse words, or anything like that. I was basically speaking like I was presenting a PhD thesis. The judge confirmed that the officer providing ground guidance was not present and that the ticketing officer did not see the other officer guide traffic. He then said at that point, it's basically a ""he said, she said"" situation and he would rule in my favor because the police side lacked evidence to prove that there wasn't any bad guidance from the other cop. 


Just wanted to thank you guys. Your advice helped a lot and to be frank, I feel like a basic understanding of law should be taught in school because in hindsight, I feel like they were trying to intimidate me several times into a nolo claim and paying the fine.

VonRage,2017-04-05 16:25:54+00:00,"A local Facebook group is circulating false ""suspect"" photos of my 14 year old cousin.","We have a store located in a tight knit community downtown. The area is about 3 blocks of studios, coffee shops and bars. We've had a string of break ins lately so everyone is on edge. 

Recently, a large black woman was caught on video after hours in a building that's full of small businesses. A few days later one of our employees had an art show on the main floor of it. My 14 year old cousin (who is also an employee for us) attended and somebody snapped a photo of her with her mom, she's also black, but obviously a child and very thin. 

The owner of the building sent out an email to all of her tenants with the photo of my cousin and a blurb about how she's their prime suspect, and it claimed that she was the woman from the video. It said that she's been seen around the building (our store used to be located inside that building, so of course she's been seen around). Lots of people wander around the building, hoping from studio to shop, and since she works in the area it's a pretty normal thing for people to do.

When we found out that she was being accused of breaking in we were appalled. She's a shy Catholic school girl from a well disciplined family, there is not a chance that it was her. We called the landlord immediately and explained that she works for us and that's why she hangs out around the area. It took some convincing, and we even had to send more photos with her and our family to get the point across. Eventually we talked the landlord into sending another email that said it was a false alarm. We felt the need to tell the child's mother, because she's so shy we didn't want her to be taken off guard by the accusations while she was in the area. 

Of course, upon finding out, her mother called the landlord and vented her frustrations. She claims that the landlord offered no apologies and was very rude, defending her reasoning and saying that they looked similar.

We thought that would be the end of it, but a local business leader posted the photo onto his closed Facebook group. He said we needed to be aware and that people like my cousin weren't welcome in the community. The owner of the store next to us saw the post and sent a private message to the Facebook group owner explaining what had happened. Instead of the post being removed, he was blocked from the group.

I'm worried for my cousin/employees safety and for her name. She's innocent, and would be the last person to commit this crime. She loves the area, is polite, and is very kind to everyone. She can't even walk the neighborhood and now the rumors are starting to affect her at school.

Do we have legal grounds for a lawsuit? Or to even threaten one if they don't take down the photos of her? I'm not sure where to begin, this is a huge injustice and it pains me that it's happening to such a sweet girl.

**Original Post:** https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/60cfmw/ny_do_her_actions_qualify_as_harassment_and_if_so/

Thank you to everyone who read and commented on my last post. Many of you were very helpful and sensitive to the issue, which I really appreciate.

I met with the lawyer I had for the initial settlement for the accident and together we composed a letter to send to the mother. He wanted the letter to be honest so he let me write down the nasty things that I wanted to say then he modified it and omitted some things so it would still get the points across without being over the top with anger.

This is what the letter says:

*""Dear Mrs. ____,*

*Over the past year and four months, I've received many letters and emails from you. My father asked you to stop sending them to me and you have refused to listen. Aside from the fact that I find this disrespectful to him, me, and our privacy, I also find these letters and emails incredibly detrimental to my health and recovery.*

*I need to let you know, in a blunt and straight-forward manner, that I carry a great amount of hate and anger towards your daughter. She made several aspects of my life harder. Due to the accident, I have several permanent physical impairments, including but not limited to a spinal cord injury which has affected three consecutive vertebrae, a severe traumatic brain injury and migraines and chronic pain. My face is disfigured to the point where I am unrecognizable to family and friends in old pictures. I have been formally diagnosed with PTSD. I no longer feel safe riding in a car and I now refuse to drive on highways. I live the physical and psychological pain of the accident everyday and I believe I will for the rest of my life. There is no way I can escape what happened. I look in the mirror everyday and my face, my wheelchair, the scars and burns all over my body are instant reminders of what happened. I live with the guilt of hitting another family's car after your daughter's car hit mine and robbing a woman of her only kids and husband. I often try to think about how lucky I am. Had I been taller than average height or not wearing my seatbelt, I would be a quadriplegic or six feet under. I bet you didn't know that, did you? I am the only survivor of the accident after all. It's a blessing and a curse that I can never get rid of.*

*You don't and can't ever understand how much my life has changed during the accident. While that is understandable, I would have hoped that you would have been more considerate to my needs and privacy, considering how it was your daughter put me in such a difficult position.*

*I do not like or appreciate your messages. I do not want you sending me any more after this. When I already think so often about what happened and have constant reminders, your letters add salt to the wounds. Especially when you paint the person who negatively affected my life and ended seven others as an angel. Do not respond to this letter. By responding or sending more messages, you are telling me that I need to take legal action for me to get you to stop. I do not want to do that but you are giving me no other option at this point.*

*Thank you.*

*Sincerely,*
*Peaches_Nicholette""*

I hope it gets my point across.

dudenell,2017-03-30 15:14:22+00:00,"[UPDATE] Towed from parking lot as a paying customer, not sure who to go after in small claims court?","**Original:** https://NP.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/60o73l/towed_from_parking_lot_as_a_paying_customer_not/

**Location:** Raleigh, NC

So along with sending the demand letter, I also called *large burger companies* corporate number. The call was recorded and I explained the situation as best as I could, knowing full well that the call was recorded and would be sent back to the franchise owner.

The franchise owner called back 2 days later, and I started off by apologizing for yelling at his employees but that I felt wronged at the time.

The franchise owner said he watched the video, and due to the time listed on the receipt (10:16PM) vs the time listed on the tow receipt (10:26PM), that he still didn't 100% believe me but that he just wanted to be done with the situation and agreed to pay for the tow.

He asked for the tow receipt and got a bit angry with me when I explained to him that I sent him a demand letter as he had not received it yet, and that the demand letter included all the receipts.

Anyways today I received a certified letter in the mail with a money order for the tow amount, which I stated was all I wanted through the phone conversation. So basically the matter is resolved to my satisfaction, I probably could have pushed for compensation from the Uber ride (~$7) to get my car, and the missed Lyft guarantee for that hour (I drive for Lyft and Uber part time, would have earned $40 that hour) but I just wanted the $150 for the tow.

Thanks again for answering my questions, and I'm glad I didn't have to file a small claims case.

**tl;dr:** They sent me a money order for the tow amount.

My husband's sister and I both had our sons within a week of each other. She and I are close. I had an extremely easy time breastfeeding. Due to complications, she did not. For the first weeks, while she was on maternity leave, I was pumping for her son as well as breastfeeding mine. 

Now she's returned to work. Her career means she works long hours. I watch Nephew; I don't mind, he's a sweet baby, and I'm spending my days changing Son's diapers and nursing him. Husband and BIL both work as well. So it's just me, but it didn't make sense to anyone to put a baby this young in daycare when someone in the family was more than willing to be there.

A few days into me watching him, SIL asked if it would be easier if I would just nurse him as opposed to pumping for her son and nursing mine. Fine with me; pumping isn't exactly a lot of fun and this means I can do considerably less. 

Now for the issue- my MIL. She came by to visit the other day. Nephew started fussing, and I started feeding him, no big deal. She freaked. Calling me a pervert, screaming (waking my son in the process) and ended up taking Nephew. SIL lost it at her mom, but MIL won't back down.

Husband and BIL don't know the details of why she's freaking out, just that she's lost it at me and I'm no longer letting her in the house, and SIL and I no longer want her around the boys. She has threatened to call CPS on me, claiming malnutrition (because I can't have enough milk for both- SIL is a pediatrician btw, both boys are perfect), sexual abuse, neglect (because I have both boys alone all day) Is this a legitimate threat? Will they have an issue with me? She has a whole list of reasons I'm neglecting/abusing both babies. 

TL;DR: I watch my son and nephew. SIL has asked me to breastfeed nephew; was already bottle feeding him pumped milk as per her request. MIL threatening CPS/legal action. What do I do?

omg-can-they-do-that,2017-03-24 01:39:13+00:00,"UPDATE: ""Complete Medical Records"" Boss","Since I know my [original post] (https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5xmtvw/massachusetts_boss_wants_everyone_in_office_to/) got posted to BoLA and there were quite a few people in the comments asking for updates... I thought I would provide closure. :)


Just got off the phone with my friend a few minutes ago and it is official -- Boss is now Ex-Boss. 


My friend did in fact go to HR as she was planning and lay out the situation for them; they seemed concerned and assured her they would look into it, and then she heard no more of it for about a week. Ex-Boss was also suspiciously quiet about the policy during that time period.... until.... last Monday he was not in the office! 


There was no explanation given to the office at large but my friend spoke to his assistant and from the information she got from her pieced together that he was in some long, important meetings with corporate HR and that he would then be taking the rest of the week on personal leave.


Well, the weekend passed and he didn't return; the office was in limbo for the beginning of this week but today someone came down from corporate and announced that Ex-Boss was officially no longer working for the company and that NewCorporateGuy would be serving as their temporary supervisor until a new one was hired.


Obviously everything largely went on behind-the-scenes but since my friend was the one to blow the whistle to her friend in HR (yes, I did see the comments on the previous thread about how HR is never your friend, lol) she managed to get a couple details at lunch re: the way it all went down.


Apparently:

* corporate was initially quickly and heavily concerned about Ex-Boss' scheming because he does have a history of dumb ideas that blew up in his or someone else's face, he had in the past always managed to take the heat off himself by throwing someone else under the bus
* when local HR came to him to tell him that this new policy was officially Bugfuck Stupid and would cause him and the company far more liability than he could possibly save them from he threw a temper tantrum and insisted that the higher execs would understand what a good idea it was
* the meetings with corporate were initially them trying to talk him down and explain why he was wrong; he resisted this strongly and turned them into seminars on why he was actually right
* eventually a VP got involved and it was over. ExBoss was not technically fired but he was strongly encouraged to submit his resignation and he will not be getting any reference other than a confirmation that he did in fact work there



My friend hasn't personally heard anything from the guy since he suddenly disappeared from the office. If he's contacted any of her coworkers they didn't share it with her. She's pretty excited to see the last of him and is hoping her new boss will be less of a moron -- apparently one of her longtime coworkers that has always been a bit of a mentor figure to her is being considered for a promotion internally instead of them hiring someone new as supervisor, so my friend might even materially benefit from this fiasco. :)

Again, my thanks to everyone who provided me with info and advice and also to those who were just supportive. I did drop off commenting after a few hours because I do browse reddit most of my workday and I am paranoid about accidentally commenting with my main when I mean to use my throwaway (and vice versa), so I just stayed logged out of this account.

I am dealing with a smallish insurance company and they have been wonderful to work with and they have been communicating with me. They told me that I do not need to take any further action at this point in time, but I wanted to get some understanding as to whether or not this lady has any legal ground to stand on.

A combination of nasty weather, my unfamiliarity with the area I was driving, and speed on my part caused me to be at fault for a car accident. I ended up rear ending a woman (my car = 2008 Honda Civic, her car = 2014 Ford Expedition) at ~35MPH on a 25MPH road (she was moving about 10-15MPH at the time of the rear-ending). My car was totaled, her car needed barely $2,500 worth of repairs. 

This woman has racked up what amounts to something on the order of $25,000 worth of medical bills. This spans chiropractic appointments, to home and Dr. office based physical therapy, etc. Her medical insurance has covered all of this at this point.

Last week my insurance company reached a verbal agreement with her and her lawyer for $40,000

She is now refusing the money from the insurance company, she is demanding that the money come from me personally, she thinks that this will help me “learn my lesson.” My insurance company shared with me a letter she wrote them…a 12-page front and back…what I am calling manifesto. (no, I am not posting it here)

I would also like to point out that she’s 24 years old and the letter makes it sound like she’s an 84-year-old woman on her deathbed with all her listed “ailments.”  I am not trying to diminish whatever pain she’s in or think she’s in but…come on right?  

So does she have any legal standing on her demand that I pay vs. my insurance pay her?

(I am being salty I have no clue how long they investigated.) They quickly found out that what she said made no sense with the evidence on scene. 

They charged her with felony assault and some other stuff too. The guy who originally drugged me took a new plea bargain and basically got a few more years on his sentence. I do not have all of the details on this nor do I want them. I am basically trying to move on with my life.

While trying to rush through the TSA checkpoint to attempt to catch one of the last flights out before the storm hit, I stacked an empty TSA belongings bin on top of the one that contained my laptop and forgot it. I checked with the TSA after realizing my mistake and was informed that a laptop had been found that matched the description in the time-frame I lost it and had been handed off to the airport lost and found.

After checking with the terminal baggage services desk, I was informed there was no physical lost and found to visit anymore, and that I was required to fill out an online form describing my item and that I would be contacted if it was located, which I did. Unfortunately, I was not contacted before my flight, so I left New York.

Yesterday, I get a phone call from the lost and found employee, asking me to describe the background image I have on my computer, and the login screen, which I was able to do. I was also able to provide other identifying details such as the brand and location of a wireless usb mouse FOB that was still in the laptop. 

Everything seemed to be going well, until the employee demanded that I provide my computers logon password so that he could ""Look around the desktop and really make sure"" it was mine. To which I emphatically declined. He informed me it was their standard policy to do so, and that if I refused he would not return my computer. Our tones quickly became heated, and I didn't think to immediately ask for a supervisor or other employee, and he hung up on me. 

The laptop is a Chrome Book, and I have two-step verification on, so while I could technically provide the password to prove that it is mine without actually allowing access to the device itself, I have absolutely no interest in doing so.

peevepet,2017-03-17 14:45:47+00:00,"Gym owner elected not to purchase a logo I designed for him, but he's using it anyway [PA/NJ]","I'm a marketing professional located in Philadelphia, PA.  I dabble in design work as a side job/hobby.  A few months ago a friend of mine told me that her gym in NJ was asking for designs for a new logo.  I asked her if her gym would consider letting me design one for them. They said I could.

Unfortunately, it turns out my friend told the gym owner that I was looking to design the logo for them for experience only.  I never told her this and was not aware that she had said it until later on.

Fast-forward to the end of the design process, I've put hours into brainstorming, sketching, designing, and refining ideas and got to speak with the gym owner personally about his preferences.  When I completed the near final designs, I started an email conversation with him to discuss final design tweaks and send him PDF proofs to look at.

In the email conversation we settled on a final logo from the PDF proofs and I brought up the compensation I was expecting for use of the logo.  Because of the miscommunication with my friend seen above, he was caught of guard with the compensation conversation.  I apologized for the miscommunication and offered to sell him the design file and full rights of usage for a discounted price.  He ultimately decided that he didn't want to pay even the discounted price and elected to pass on using my logo.

I apologized in a final email and told him that if he didn't want to use the logo, I would keep the design for myself and wished him luck with whatever direction he decided to go in.  This all happened in June-July 2016.

Last night I discovered via a video on Facebook from the gym that members of the gym in question are wearing shirts with the logo I designed on them.  I dig a little deeper and realize that the owner has taken the logo proofs I sent him and used them to create merchandise to sell to his members.  The design and colors are exactly the same as one I sent him in the PDF proof.  I've seen more than 10 shirts with my logo on them in Facebook pictures and videos alone.

Despite the earlier miscommunication, I made it clear that he had to pay to use the logo.  His last correspondence with me was that he was going to pass on using my design.  I never even sent him any design files other than a PDF with multiple iterations of the logo on it, so he lifted the image from the proof in order to use the logo.

I'm quite upset that he stole my design.  I have the full email correspondence which covers the design process, his intentions for the logo, compensation miscommunication, clarification, and ultimate place we settled where he knew he couldn't have the logo for free.  I also have the original design files and PDF proofs I sent him from the design process.  I also have pictures of members at his gym wearing the logo on shirts.

I am wondering what my best course of action is here.  I obviously want him to stop selling my design immediately, but I feel like I'm in a weird spot because he has already profited from selling it.  I also don't know the extent to which he has used the design.  During the process he indicated in his emails that he intended to use it for: website, window decals, a spare tire cover for a Jeep, business cards, and a banner at a local swim club.

I'm not sure cease and desist is enough.  If possible, I'd like to recover some/all of the profits he's made from illegally stealing the design I created.  I was extremely apologetic for all the confusion and even offered to lower my price significantly in the process, but it appears he never intended to pay because he had enough to steal the logo for free.

Any advice is appreciated.  Thank you all for your time and the awesome community.

________________

EDIT:  Wow, this post became a lot more popular than I ever imagined.  Thank you all for the advice!

A lot of the process mistakes I made were already understood.  I learned those lessons months ago back when he originally ""passed"" on paying to use my design.  Because of the introduction by my friend, the whole experience ended up being a lot more casual and friendly than it probably should have considering it was still a business transaction at the end of the day.

To those (many designers) that suggested the file I gave him was a problem, I honestly don't think it was.  I certainly could have given him a file type that was harder to steal, but I don't think he stole directly from the PDF anyway.  I suspect he had another designer get the logo for him by simply recreating/tracing it in their own program.

As for the rest of the legal advice, thank you all!  I have a lot to consider, but I am likely going to just send him an invoice for the original price without any discount for feeling bad about the original miscommunication.  I'm not trying to get rich or anything here, I just don't want him to be profiting off of work I did without any compensation.  Should he fail to pay the invoice, I will likely take him to court.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5zxz1u/gym_owner_elected_not_to_purchase_a_logo_i/,legaladvice,1279,294,
notthepatiofurniture,2017-03-16 13:07:15+00:00,My landlord may have included my personal items in the sale of her property (Michigan),"My location is Michigan. I have been renting a house for four years and my landlord recently sold the property. My lease is up in September. The new landlord requested a walkthrough of the house and I was present when she did this walkthrough. During the walkthrough my new landlord said that she would be getting me some protective tarps to put over the patio furniture when it wasn’t in use. I let the new landlord know that the patio furniture was actually my own personal property. The new landlord stated that she had liked the patio furniture so much that she had it specifically added to the sale contract and that now she owned the patio furniture and all of the appliances in the house. I let the new landlord know that I also owned the dishwasher. The new landlord insisted that she now owned both of those items and that I would have to take it up with my old landlord if I wanted to be compensated. My gut reaction was that this was bullshit and told my new landlord as much which didn’t exactly endear me to her. She left in a huff insisting she would call the police to stop me from taking those items.

My questions: This is bullshit right? They can’t sell my property without my knowledge or consent or payment. How do I protect myself when I move out and what if she tries to sue me?

I tried to contact my old landlord but I’ve just gotten a generic, “I am no longer your landlord. New landlord is now your landlord” response.

I’ve found the receipt for the dishwasher but so far haven’t found the bill of sale for the patio furniture. The patio furniture is something I picked up at a deep discount at a designer sample sale and isn’t replaceable at the price I paid.

**TLDR:** New landlord thinks she owns my patio furniture and dishwasher.

doublelist,2017-03-08 16:12:26+00:00,"Relative lived in home I owned, died, her daughter wants to either live in it or get money from me. Oklahoma City.","21 years ago I inherited a house that I did not want to live in at the time and was considering selling. My grandmother needed a place to live and wanted to live in the house, but could not afford to buy it.  We agreed that she would live in it without paying rent directly, but would pay other costs associated with keeping the house rather than selling it - property tax, utilities, etc. With this arrangement she paid less than the market value for rent for the property and had full control to do whatever she wanted with it, while I didn't have to worry about the house or being a ""landlord."" (I know that in retrospect this was probably not the smartest arrangement legally speaking, but I was barely out of high school when it began and didn't know any better - and as the years went by I just never thought to fix what wasn't broken.)

I did maintain my own insurance policy on the house for my own protection, but that's about it. We never drew up a formal contract of any kind, and we never had any conflicts about the arrangement.  

She has recently passed away and I am considering living in the house myself as I have now moved back to the area.

However, I have been contacted by her daughter (my aunt, and the heir of her will).  She wants to move into the house herself with her daughter. In short, she believes that because my grandmother paid the costs of the house for so long, my grandmother has at least some ownership right to the house.  She also believes that even if you consider my grandmother a renter, as her child she has the right to take up residence in the house on the same terms my grandmother had (i.e. not paying rent).  

Even if I weren't looking to live in the house myself, I would be concerned about this aunt living in the property. She has a heavy criminal background including felonies and in terms of rental history I know she has at least 3 evictions. 

I will consult a lawyer if needed, but wanted to get some advice first as to whether that is necessary. I am not sure whether I should be concerned about the situation or if it is just talk.

autocraticbb,2017-03-07 19:25:35+00:00,[California] My mechanic gave my car to someone for personal use without my permission and put 100 miles on it in 2 days,"I brought my Honda Civic to a mom and pop body shop on Tuesday (2/28) that was recommended by my mothers coworker for cosmetic repairs. There was nothing wrong with the engine, I only wanted a few scratches and dents fixed. The mechanic told my mom he was going to replace the bumper and it would be finished the following day (3/1) or the latest Thursday (3/2).

My mom kept calling the mechanic and they kept giving her excuses as to why the car wasn't ready. She told them that she needed to use the car and they were taking longer than the time frame they provided, so they offered to let her take the car back and bring it back in a few days to finish the touch ups.

My mom is very careful, so before she took the car to the mechanic she took a picture of the gas tank (which was full) and the mileage. When she turned the car on, the tank was half empty and she noticed they put 100 miles on the vehicle. She asked what was going on and the mechanic confessed that he gave the car to someone and didn't start working on the car until Thursday (3/2) when it was initially dropped off on Tuesday (2/28).

No one gave my mom an explanation as to what they were doing with the car, so we decided to go to the police station to file a report. I explained to a police officer what was going on, and he initially thought I was trying to sue the mechanic. That's not what I'm trying to do, I just want to cover my ass in case they did something illegal and I have proof that i filed a report. The officer told me i couldn't file a report, so I asked him ""Well what if they did something illegal"" and he said ""See now you're talking about ""what ifs"" and we don't do police work based on ""what ifs"""".

If I can't file a police report, what am I supposed to do now? 

EDIT: I also forgot to mention that we left a $200 deposit with them that the mechanic claims he never received. What should we do about the deposit? ",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5y2snx/california_my_mechanic_gave_my_car_to_someone_for/,legaladvice,1534,153,

Colorado.","My partners and I moved into an apartment two months ago, we're all signed and listed on the 24 month lease. For context: I'm a woman in a polyamorous triad relationship with my boyfriend and girlfriend. The landlady hosted a BBQ party to make new tenants feel welcome (it's a small complex, only about 20 units total). While there she asked me we knew each other because we seemed very close and I told her we're all dating each other. We don't make a big deal over it but we're open about it and happy to explain it to anyone not familiar with it (FYI /r/Polyamory has some good info on the topic). We've been together for about four years and are very happy. 

The landlady threw a fit, exclaiming how ""sinful"" and ""immoral"" our relationship is and that we're a bunch of ""sex-crazed children, a bastard and two whores"" (we're ages 27-31), and that we're going to burn forever in hell unless with change our ways. I've honestly never seen such a display by a person. We politely said we'll have to disagree and that we've had quite enough to eat and will now be leaving.

We thought that was the end of it but today we received a letter on our door stating that ""nowhere in your lease was it stated that grotesque perversions were tolerated here."" and that we had 14 days to leave or that all means would be used to remove us from the property. It also stated ""you can cover your own repairs and utility bills now, I'm not helping you in any way."" - in the lease it said the LL is responsible for the utilities and normal maintenance/repairs of the unit.

Can she actually do this? As far as I can tell we're not in any violation of the written lease, we're not using drugs or throwing loud parties, and we're not breaking any of the occupancy rules. We're just three people that want to go about our lives. She doesn't have to agree with our lifestyle and we don't have to agree with her religion, we just want a place to live in peace.

thiefll,2017-03-03 19:41:43+00:00,My landlord used my car while I was away. I believe she still has the key. What can I do right now? WI,"I moved into a house on January 1st.  The owner, my landlord, lives across the street in a separate house.

I went out of town and informed her beforehand so that she could keep an eye out. I ended up returning earlier than planned, early this morning, and came home to find my car missing.

I didn't immediately panic because I had given my brother permission to use it.  He has a copy of the key, and had asked before my trip if he could borrow it to haul some purchases that his car is too small for. I agreed and told him to use it whenever, since i'd be gone all week anyway and wouldn't be using it.

A bit later my car pulled into the driveway. I came outside expecting to see my brother, but instead saw the landlord walking to the end of the driveway and across the street.  I confronted her and she said she had no idea what I was talking about, then hurried into her home and slammed the door.

I have called the police to report this and they said someone will be coming to my home to take a report. I don't know what my odometer reading was before I left so I have no idea how far she has driven it, or if she drove it on more than that instance.

To make things worse I checked and my spare car key is missing. It was admittedly in a very obvious spot. I could not find it in the car so I am assuming she has it still.

In the mean time while I wait to do a police report, is there anything I can or should do?  Are police likely to do anything about the key that she still has?  

I am extremely uncomfortable in this situation as it means my landlord entered my home to take the spare key, and I am uncomfortable with the idea that she still has it.

Well this isn't a very interesting update, but I figured you guys would like to know that justice was sort of served. I just wanted to thank everyone for all the responses on my first two posts, it helped me a lot. Especially to the people who advised me to be proactive and persistent in contacting the police, and to the person who mentioned renter's insurance, which I didn't even realize I had (thanks dad!)

 So everything happened much quicker than I anticipated, and it's all pretty much settled. Also I'm not sure how much detail I should give since this all just happened, but Jane took a plea bargain (not sure if this is the correct terminology) and plead guilty to misdemeanor assault and destruction of property. I'm a bit upset that she pretty much got a slap on the wrist with the sentence and fine she received, but I suppose it's worth it because she cooperated in breaking our lease. I filed for a restraining order against her and filed a claim with my insurance company for my damaged and stolen makeup, which was thankfully covered by my renter's insurance. Jane's parents moved all of her stuff out of the apartment yesterday and gave me a little money to cover her portion of the rent that she owes me. It wasn't nearly enough, but they seem like surprisingly nice people and I feel bad that they have to deal with such a nut case of a daughter.

Livobive202020,2017-02-28 12:06:49+00:00,[C.A] [45F] I'm a high school teacher who is going to get fired by my boss for my relationship with a former student [30M] who graduated over 12 years ago.,"I'm going to start with a little bit of backstory before I jump into this as I feel I need to explain this entire situation. I am a high school teacher, I've been working at this local school for nineteen years now and I have seen students come and go as they move on with their lives. As I began to progress through the school, taking up a very important role as the head of English I was able to interact with my students more and help them through their education.

Twelve years ago, when I was 33 years old, I saw my first class as the head of English graduate and it was the proudest moment for me as a teacher. Eleven years later, I run into one of my former students while heading for a train, we began to talk about his time at college and what he doing now and he asked me about my life. It was great to hear from him and he even asked me out for coffee, which I was debated on whether he was asking me out, but in the end, it was a kind gesture.

We went out for coffee and everything went smoothly, he did flirt with me and I enjoyed the attention. We went on a few more dates after that and then we started to become more serious. But now, one year later, I'm getting fired by my boss for the relationship.

---

A few weeks ago, I was told by one of my co-workers that my boss was aware of my relationship with my former student and he wanted to talk to me about it. When we finally got to talk about it, he mentioned that he strongly against the idea of it (Which of course he would be) but I told him that he left over twelve years ago and that it doesn't break any laws.

He listened to everything I had to say and understood everything, but he was just worried about me and asked if I was attracted to him while he was a student and I said no. He was okay with what I said, but proceeded to say that I am getting fired in the next few weeks as he doesn't want a scandal to go around the school and for the students to know.

I understand why he may do something like this, but he graduated over twelve years ago and none of my students will ever know that he was my former student unless they do some research on him. My co-workers agree that it's a little excessive and that I should try and talk to him more about our relationship. I have mentioned this to my boyfriend and he has said the same thing.

I am now worried for my future as a teacher because of my boss's misguided motives. The only people who know that my boyfriend is a former student are my co-workers and my boss and plus, he is 30 years old now and is far from a former student now. I just want some advice in how to handle this situation and maybe there are some teachers here to can help as well.

---

tl;dr: Eleven years after he graduated, I began dating my former student and now I am going to get fired by my boss because of it despite the fact that the relationship is legal and the teacher/student bond is gone.

-vrc-dach,2017-02-27 17:35:34+00:00,[UPDATE] Police want to give me back seized drug money. Can I be arrested?,"My original post wasnt too exciting and, understandably, didnt get too much of a response.. But i figured at the very least you guys deserved an update.

[Original post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5ttqc4/ca_police_want_to_give_me_back_seized_drug_money/) but the TL:DR is that a decade ago I was caught selling drugs and had $5000 confiscated. I turned my life around and forgot about the money. Got a letter in the mail from the sheriffs department saying they had $5000 they owed me. I wanted to know if was a rouse to re-arrest me for some past sin

Now on to the update....

Everyone agreed that the letter fishy. The top voted comments said I should send a lawyer in my place to pick up the funds. That sounded like a great idea but also an expensive one. So I decided i'd just take my chances. First of all I was confident that I didnt have any outstanding warrants because you can search for open warrants online. And I figured worst case scenario I'd just bail myself out and fight whatever the charges were. To be honest, the idea of going into this high risk situation was a little bit thrilling. I've been sober for years but the idea of walking into a room where im picking up drug money &amp; might get arrested just tickled those same areas of my psyche that selling drugs used to. Not a healthy response im sure, but hey, no one gets addicted to drugs because they exhibit great decision making. So anyway I told my wife what I was doing and who to call if she didnt hear back from me, I wrote my boss's phone number on my forearm in case I had to explain why I wasnt going to make it into work the next day, and I headed into the sheriffs department…

And they handed me a cashier's check for $5800

Now im going to use a couple hundred to take my wife shopping for being such a supportive partner, and put the rest in my savings account &amp; pretend I never got it. I like to think of it as a little present that my drugged-out self gave to my sober self as a reward for staying clean. Thanks for the support r/legal advice! See you all next time.

DeadDrone999,2017-02-27 12:18:36+00:00,Update - Dog Ate Neighbor's Drone,"*Edit: [Original](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5oa42v/dog_ate_my_neighbors_drone_am_i_liable_il/) *

A small update to my neighbor flying his drone in my backyard and attacking my dog:

I was served a summons by a Sheriff's Deputy, neighbor decided to take me to Small Claims over his drone. My MIL is a paralegal secretary, so I was able to get a free consultation with a lawyer where she works to ask some questions about what to bring and how to prepare. He seemed genuinely amused that my neighbor was even trying to sue. He also suggested I counter sue and how I could possibly add in more damages. 

He also told me that my neighbor and I technically live within 5 miles of an airport, and even though it doesn't have a tower technically that falls under FAA regulations. I called the hotline from google and spoke to them about my neighbor's hobby of flying out of line of sight, flying several thousand feet in the air, flying near an airport and made an inquiry into if he was registered to fly drones, saying he owned two very large drones (he already bought a new one, this one is almost 5' across). I don't know the weight of his, but it definitely is at least a few pounds. They took my information and have called me back once, so I know they're investigating but don't know anything else. Not sure if they'll tell me anything anyways.

I brought both police reports to court, as well as several photos of my backyard, photos of our shared 8' high privacy fence, medical bills for my  dog, and a few short videos I had of him doing fly bys over my dog in the past. His main argument to the judge was that I ""maliciously installed a table to allow my dog to jump high enough to catch his drone, which I (somehow) trained him to do"". Which, yes I had recently bought a new picnic table, but only so I have somewhere to sit and eat outside. I argued that his flying was causing my dog anxiety and that's what provoked it, and thanks to y'alls advice, that my dog could have potentially died from ingesting part of the drone or if the drone hit him. In the end, he now has to pay me just under $2,000 for various vet bills (xrays, dental exams, sedation, medication etc). He is also banned from flying over my property, and I installed trail cams front and back yards just in case. He seems pretty upset with me, so I wanted to be careful. 

The only thing that could make this better is if the FAA finds a reason to fine him or take away his drones.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5wgevt/update_dog_ate_neighbors_drone/,legaladvice,20392,2,
ceaseblogging,2017-02-26 18:16:11+00:00,UPDATE: I write a pseudonymous blog. Someone posed as me and got a book deal. I've been ordered to hand over my website.,"[Previous post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5uzlut/i_write_a_pseudonymous_blog_someone_posed_as_me/)

Thank you for all the advice to my last post. I especially appreciate the supportive private messages I received from IT experts and fellow mommy bloggers.


As for the update, unfortunately this problem has become too complicated for me to fight and I've chosen to walk away. I know this does not make much sense at first, but there are many personal considerations that have gone into my decision.


In the comments to my last post, I alluded to being worried about the financial security of my family. What I did not mention is that much of this fear comes from the fact that my mother in law was recently diagnosed with a serious (though hopefully treatable) disease. My family and the families of my in-laws are helping her through this difficult period.

But the difficulties are more than financial. This has been a very emotionally trying time for my husband and my children. Prior to this legal problem, my husband and I had discussions about me reducing my blogging or stepping back entirely for a stretch. The amount of time it took to write for my blog is honestly time that I need to put towards supporting my family right now.

So one consideration in my decision to not pursue a legal fight was the money and (more importantly) the time it would take. Although my husband and I figured the money would work itself out, especially if our case was as strong as everyone here said it was.

But the real reason I decided not to fight the publisher is this: I wrote things on my blog about my in-laws (including my MIL) under the assumption that I was writing anonymously. I was never mean, but I did state some difficult truths about their behavior and unintentional emotional manipulation. 

We came to the conclusion that any effort to fight the publisher carried with it too great a risk that I would be outed publicly as the author of the blog. Given that emotions are running high now that we are all caring for my MIL, it would be devastating if my in-laws  became aware of my writing. This concern settled the issue for us.

The publisher filed a DMCA complaint against my blog. Thanks to the advice of everyone here, I made a backup of all my writing for myself. Strangely enough, a (very poorly formatted) archive of old posts also appeared on the new blog run by the impostor and the publisher. It looks like they just used copy and paste. I sent an email to the lawyers saying that while I was not conceding ownership of the blog or of my posts, I would not be fighting them at this time. They want me to sign some papers, but I have told them that I will not do that. They seem to have backed off.

Honestly, I am heartbroken to lose my blog, but I would be more heartbroken if it became something that would create a rupture in my family as we try to support my MIL. 

Thank you again to everyone. Hopefully somewhere down the road I can begin writing anew.

anonymousrecords,2017-02-25 19:06:21+00:00,(Illinois) My aunt died and left me her record collection. I found out some of the records are extremely rare and worth alot of money. Now my relatives are foaming at the mouth trying to get their hands on the records and are threatening to take me to court.,"Hey reddit...
Well, like the title says, we lost my aunt in January. It really wasn't totally unexpected but it was still really hard to deal with. My aunt didn't have any kids of her own, so her nieces and nephews were her kids. She was close to all of us and she was really like a second mom.
My aunt loved her vinyl collection and we'd listen to her records and talk about her favorite bands together for as long back as I can remember. Before she died she told me she wanted me to take the records and her turntable and made me promise not to sell them which of course I said I wouldn't. I took them with me at her insistence maybe several days before she passed.

Since the funeral I've finally sat down and looked at all the records with my best friend who's a huge vinyl lover. It turns out that some of the records in her collection are worth hundred and or thousands of dollars. It was kind of cool to find that out but again, no big because I promised I wasn't gonna sell.

Well I made the mistake of telling my sister....who then told my mom....and now word has leaked out to the other neices and nephews. My mom is telling me that it isn't fair that my aunt left me something so valuable and that it isn't right for me to keep what she says is a small fortune to myself. The others (my aunt's two neices and nephew that aren't my siblings) are saying that I had no right to take the records and that I need to return them before they get the court involved. They said that we can settle the matter out of court if I agree to take the records to an appraiser, sell them, and split the amount from the sales with them with a portion going to everyone and that it's what my aunt would've wanted because she loved all the kids equally.

I don't think so. She gave these to me and not them and they just want to sell them because they want the money. My question is can they take me to court? I don't want to sell them but I don't know how any of that works.


Help? Anyone?

tldr: my aunt left me very rare and valuable records. My family didn't care until they found out how much they were worth. Now they're pissed at me and trying to pressure me to sell them and are threatening to take me to court.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5w5ogt/illinois_my_aunt_died_and_left_me_her_record/,legaladvice,1427,211,

I'll try and keep this short. I took all of the comments I read about what to do into consideration. Most suggested investing in a security camera system. As much as I don't want to do this, I'm going to have to.

Today (2/24/2017), while I am at work, my S/O had to run to the  store for something before work. S/O has to drive past our house to get to work from the store. S/O said that while passing our house our crazy neighbor lady is in OUR front yard with a leaf blower, blowing leaves around our yard, knowing that nobody was home in our house. Clearly on our property, no questions asked. I am fucking irate.

Security cameras are being bought TODAY and being installed as soon as possible. At what point is trespassing, actually trespassing? I do not want her on my property but she was clearly on my property. A part of me wants to say she was doing what she was doing to get our dog worked up inside of our house. 

I'm desperately looking for some help here.

My village has decided on the new artwork for the village's vehicle sticker and guess what, it's ""Blue Lives Matter."" I'm not a really political guy and I don't want anything on my car that can be taking the wrong way.  Since I travel into Chicago frequently and park my car on the street, I'm afraid this image may attract some unwanted attention.

Here is a link to the [article.](http://patch.com/illinois/orlandpark/new-vehicle-stickers-orland-park-show-support-police)

The rules in our fair village are pretty simple.  Residence are required to purchase and display the sticker on their vehicle by a certain date.  I plan to purchase it, just not display it.  If I got a ticket for not displaying the sticker, would I have a case to get it dismissed based on the circumstances?  

**Update #1**:  I've been asked by a few people to give updates and I will as time comes.  I also sent an email to the mayor and trustees, this is what I wrote:

""Dear Mayor McLaughlin and Members of the Board of Trustees,

I am writing to you today because I recently became aware of the design of the new village vehicle sticker.  While I am a big supporter of the police, I do not want an image on my car that can be misinterpreted as a political statement.  I drive my car into neighborhoods of Chicago and surrounding suburbs where this image could be taken the wrong way.  I am asking that a generic version of the sticker be made available as an alternative.  If not, I will be happy to purchase one but I will not display on my vehicle.  Thank you for your time.

When I made it, I was advised to get a lawyer right away. I was also advised that Indiana's DCS doesn't investigate pregnant women who don't already have kids, and that the woman claiming to be a social worker might be an imposter.

I contacted and met with a lawyer, and explained the situation to him. He seemed to agree that something was very fishy. To make a long story short, the woman ""handling our case"" has no affiliation with DCS. 

I'm still in complete shock.

We went straight to the police. They're taking this very seriously. I can't give a lot of details because it's an ongoing investigation, but she seems to have been a very skilled/well-researched liar. I never would have known anything was amiss without the advice of this subreddit and the intervention of my attorney. I feel like a complete idiot, but the instinct to cooperate unquestioningly when faced with an intimidating ""authority figure"" is strong.

I haven't had the baby yet. We're staying at a trusted family member's home until the baby is born. My OB and the hospital we'll be delivering at have already been informed of the situation, and will be taking the appropriate security measures. I'm still freaking out, but we're taking every precaution for the safety of my child, and hopefully everything will turn out okay.

ceaseblogging,2017-02-19 18:27:03+00:00,I write a pseudonymous blog. Someone posed as me and got a book deal. I've been ordered to hand over my website.,"For the last three years, I've written a parenting blog under a pseudonym. It started out small, but over time I've developed a decent sized audience. It's not huge, but it's respectable. I write entirely about my family and my life.

A completely surreal thing happened this week and it's escalated to the point that I know I need to contact an attorney. But it's a long weekend and I can't seem to get in touch with anyone. I'm hoping to get some advice here in the interim.

Earlier in the week, I started receiving a couple emails from readers congratulating me on my book deal. This came as news to me, because I've never tried to get a book deal. I asked the readers where they heard this, and they pointed me towards a couple news releases that ultimately led back to a small publishing outfit. According to the publisher, my pseudonym will be writing a book on parenting, life, and other topics. Also according to the publisher, my blog would be moving to a new site to better integrate with the book. It reeked of rebranding.

I immediately contacted the publisher and basically asked ""what the fuck??"" Within a day, I received a cease and desist email from a law firm on behalf of the publisher. From the letter and a few follow up emails, this is what I have pieced together:

Some deranged person decided to claim that THEY were the one who wrote under my pseudonym. This person contacted the publisher and worked out a book deal. This person told the publisher that I was a paid ghost writer who occasionally helped with posts and managed the website. This person warned the publisher that I had become disgruntled because I was supposedly informed that I would be let go in a few weeks once the book deal went through. The publisher was warned that I might try to retaliate. The publisher was told that when I learned the book deal was final, I locked the ""real author"" out of her own website and that I was now holding it hostage.

I was warned that I had to immediately turn access of the blog over to the publisher or risk further legal and civil penalties. I've been warned that any further posts made under the pseudonym will compound the damages because the pseudonym now belongs to the publisher and I was fired by the ""real author.""

I'm baffled and scared. What's uniquely worrisome is that the firm somehow knows my real name. The cease and desist is addressed to me. I have no idea how they obtained that information.

Because of the threats, I've decided to go radio silent on my blog. I usually post once a day, but I haven't posted anything since Wednesday night. In the mean time, the new blog has posts. It's weird and creepy and just plain scary because they are posts where someone is pretending to be me. I've seen my traffic take a nose-dive as it appears many of my readers have found the new blog over the last few days.

I'm hoping to reach a lawyer on Tuesday, but in the mean time, what can I do? Beyond the bizarre happenings with the blog, I'm beginning to be nervous about my own safety. I'm in Virginia.

plutos_kiss,2017-02-15 14:22:58+00:00,[UPDATE] My sister let someone off Craigslist borrow a saddle and they are now trying to sell it.,"Previous post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5pr5ek/in_my_sister_let_someone_off_craigslist_borrow_a/).

Sorry it took me so long to update. A few days after the original post I ended up texting the girl since she was ignoring my sister and mother and we had not heard back from *her* mother. I told her that brand and model of saddle was selling for $800, and unless the saddle or a check was in our possession that evening, the next time she would hear from us would be through a lawyer and the police. Long story short we had the saddle back that weekend. They left it in their horse trailer outside of their house so we didn't even have to see them again. The saddle was in the exact condition it was given to her in.

We got very lucky that the situation resolved so easily and quickly. I live in the city and am naturally leery of people, but my family lives in a small farm community, and I assume this is why my sister felt comfortable letting this girl try out the saddle on her own. She and my family were floored at the audacity of this girl and we have all learned from this. The most important lesson being to not attempt to take the law into your own hands. As a user in the previous thread said, ""Imagine you are Batman. What would Batman do in this situation? Whatever that thing is, do not do it.""

dominaustin,2017-02-14 13:53:55+00:00,"Ex-GF &amp; her mom, agreed in writing to repay a personal loan. After default, I sent 5 polite reminders over 2 mos. &amp; notice of default with my intent to file. I received an email threatening injunction &amp; criminal harassment charges if I try to collect. Isn't that blackmail?","TLDR Summary.  My ex-gf was personally loaned approximately 5k to start a business, and another 4900 to pay off credit cards and debts.  She and her mother agreed to repay it in writing.  Repayment is very important as my family is raising money to pay for the brain tumor medical bills of my new baby cousin.  Despite knowing this, they deliberately defaulted, leaving me with thousands in losses and unable to help my family as much as possible. 

I tried five times to politely collect over the past two months and only a handful of texts about health of friends or the like.  The relationship has been cordial but cold.  After sending the five emails/texts over the past two months, the last of which was a statement about having no choice but to seek judgement, I received a troubling email.  Her mother emailed me a letter stating they were now never going to repay the loan, and falsely claimed that I was harassing them.  She followed that by very serious threat to make criminal harassment complaints, file for restraining order/ injunction if I try to contact my ex, the  mom, family or friends for any reason ever again.  

This threat, is their only hope to stop me from going to court with the contract and documents I hold which proves their agreement to repay.   She knows that I know that I will have to spend thousands in legal costs fighting that, more than what is owed, just to protect myself.  They will gain thousands at my loss if I do not file in order to not have to deal with false criminal complaints.  Is this not Blackmail?   

It is of note that during the breakup the ex told me that if I ever tried to collect her mother (a former police officer) would have her retribution upon me. 

Jurisdiction:   Mom is in Florida.  ExGF is here in TX in the same city as I. 


Full Summary: 

She and her mother both agreed in writing to repay the personal loan over 12 months.  They made the first four payments and stopped.  The last payment I received was in October. 

In the 2 months that they are past due I have emailed in writing or text a total of 4 times asking about payment dates.  Each instance was polite and professional as the relationship had been cordial (there were a handful of other discussions about health or her needing to pick up her bike from my house etc...no break up bickering for months and we had made peace).   

In the last text conversation I was told by my ex that it was not a loan but now ""investment"" in the business (despite the contract stating otherwise, and the payment made to her personally).  I immediately knew that meant she was deliberately defaulting, and her next message confirmed it.  She told me she was dissolving the business and I would never see another dime.  

I told her that was within her right to dissolve, but that it was a personal loan, and if she could even make a partial payment to let me please know.  She then told me the agreement was made under duress (It wasn't).  Clever girl...but without merit.   

When I told her that closing the business does not absolve personal loans she became angry.  She then insinuated she would slander me to our mutual industry and friends (tell everyone I was a creeper) if I tried to contact her again.  I told her I would not contact her again and have not done so.

Her mother had invited me, in writing prior, to contact her anytime I needed assistance with payment issues, and stated in email in multiple instances that she would ""Absolutely see that the loan was repaid in full, and on time"".  She gave me her word verbally and followed up in writing to confirm.   

Two weeks ago, I reached out to her mom via email twice over 5 days, and let her know of the issue and to please assist.  I was polite and professional. I had not emailed her mother about the loan since her last payments were made in Oct.    

I stopped contacting my ex as it is pointless to do so and awaited word from mom.  Despite explaining the need for repayment due to my cousin's medical bills, there was no reply from her mother.  

I followed up the two emails with a text stating to the effect ""I told you my family needs money for the medical bills of my cousin and you haven't replied?  You gave me your word.  I cannot just let the money go.   You are leaving me no option but to go to small claims court and file"".  

In response, I just received an email stating the following:

a. That they were not going to ever repay the ""investment"" (in cahoots now..as they made certain to not call it investment prior as they wanted me to have no claim in the biz).
b. That I was harassing her daughter and her and if I contact my ex or  any of her friends and family, either myself or through a third party, that they will file criminal harassment charges and seek injunction and that I must stop this harassment NOW!.  

In other words, if you try to collect on this loan ever again, which we are obligated to pay but would rather not, we will cause you legal pain fighting off injunction, and criminal complaints that can cost you tremendous money to fight against, so go away and never tell anyone of this.  

It is of note that when I first ran into a repayment issue last year, my ex told me if I tried to collect that her mother would have her retribution upon me.  Her mom told me not to worry about that...and well, here it comes. 

My question is...if there is no harassment (and there is not), and she and her mother gains thousands of dollars if I do not ask the court to enforce the contract if I comply with her threatening email and just go away, is that not blackmail????  

It is my understanding that someone cannot threaten unjust criminal legal action against me in order to gain financially.  

Any thoughts would be appreciated.

You people have been as big a part of this as our own family (who knew that kids tugged at reddit's heartstrings so much!), and as promised, here we are at the exciting conclusion:


* My lawyer called in a personal favor to the judge to expedite the final orders hearing as much as possible, it only took three weeks from the temporary hearing to today when we had our final; which apparently is warp speed versus the norm. 
* The mom's mom made a huge personal sacrifice by testifying, but she did, and painted a truly sad picture of what things were like before we came into the mix. We even discovered that now, while she is in prison, the mom is pregnant again and used meth intravenously the whole time until she was locked up in December.  So when she pops this one out and the baby's poop tests positive for narcotics, the state is likely to take it away. Addiction is a cruel mistress. We have gotten close to grandma and we plan to keep her close. She has always taken care of him when she was able to and really put her neck out on the line to look out for her grandson's well being. 
* We were granted **ALL** of our terms, everything! This includes a discretionary visitation claus, that basically says me and my son have to mutually agree to allow her to visit. I will not be unfair to the mom or abuse this flexibility, but it gives me a lot more leverage to require that she is clean and set healthy boundaries. 
* And here we are, a new and very happy family of three and we love the shit out of our little man (even though he is for some reason screaming about Jurassic World right now). We aren't perfect, and we are winging it at best, but we are going to bust our asses forever to give our son the life he deserves.

babyblues17,2017-02-07 17:40:10+00:00,[Indiana] I'm pregnant and being investigated by DCS.,"[Hamilton County, Indiana]

Hello,

I'm twenty-nine years old, happily married, my husband and I are college-educated, have respectable, stable jobs, own a home in a nice neighborhood...we're basically as prepared as anyone can be to start a family. I'm almost nine months pregnant with our first child.

The problem is that eleven years ago, when my husband was a freshman in college, he was arrested for possession of marijuana. It was a large enough amount that he was charged with a Class D felony (our jurisdiction is *very* harsh regarding marijuana), but not intent to deal. He plead guilty and did his time and probation without a problem, passing every drug test along the way. He has not touched marijuana (or any other illegal substance) since, and we rarely even drink (and haven't at all in over a year). I have no criminal record, and have never done drugs myself. It was a stupid mistake he made as a foolish eighteen-year-old, and he's worked hard to put it behind him.

Someone has apparently contacted Child Services in our area and informed them that we are drug users. This accusation is being taken very seriously because of my husband's record. We have been as cooperative as could be with our caseworker. We've been interviewed, our home has been examined, and she found nothing remotely suspicious or incriminating. We have both taken drug tests and passed. 

Our caseworker says that everything looks just fine so far. Unfortunately, she also says that there's still the possibility that our child could be taken from us in the labor and delivery ward, and that we won't be allowed to take her home. I was devastated and horrified to hear that. When I asked why, she said it was ""not up to [her],"" and ""we'll have to wait and see,"" which made absolutely no sense to me. What gives? I feel like there's something she isn't telling me, but I have no experience with DCS and I'm not aware of anything we could have possibly done wrong. I know they'll have to test my daughter for drugs once she's born, but she has not been exposed to drugs (nothing more than prenatal vitamins--not even tylenol!), and I already proved that by passing a drug test. I'm scared and confused.

Do I need a lawyer? I had anticipated spending our savings on our new daughter/parental leave, but I will use that money for a lawyer if I have to.

joshbro73,2017-01-31 21:05:40+00:00,Update: Duped to wire money for a home sale,"OP #1: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5mm6kz/will_i_get_my_money_back_i_was_duped_to_wire_to/

OP #2: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5nz2fd/update_will_i_get_my_money_back_i_was_duped_to/

TL;DR - Someone hacked my real estate broker's email, changed wiring instructions for the down payment on our home, and we wound up sending the money to another bank. We've been trying to figure out if and when we'll get our money back, and if we can buy this house.

We closed on the house, after paying 5% down, two weeks ago. We moved in about 10 days ago and all was well. I had to pause checking in with the banks and law enforcement because I had some major projects at work, in addition to the actual moving stuff. Plus I listened to you all and just thought I'd trust the process as you indicated I couldn't really speed things along. So life happened and we moved.

Fast forward to a week ago Friday. I had reserved the morning to call everyone and ask for updates: FBI, County Sheriff, My bank, and the bank that received the wire and we thought was holding the money while investigation the fraud. 

A side note: I NEVER heard from either law enforcement agency. Not once, other than the act of filing a report. Both the FBI and Sheriff have yet to call me for any information, update, or anything. I'm pretty disappointed. It's all the more crazy in light of what happens next.

So Friday morning my first calls were to FBI and Sheriff. Nothing. FBI will call you back if they need more info. Left a message w Sheriff...also nothing. So I call the bank holding the money in the frozen bank account, capitalone.

I get to the customer service of the fraud dept and explain my situation. The lady on the phone asks for some verifying info, which was the first time they had asked that. I gave my phone number. She says ""that's not what I have on file."" I tried another. No luck. She says ""Sir, we spoke to you this past Wednesday and you said you would be getting us some more information...""

I exploded. Because on Wednesday I was slammed with work. I never called them. So I flip out saying ""that wasn't me!!!!!"" and she says she'll talk to my investigator. She's gone for awhile, then gets back on the line and tells me that the investigator will be calling me straight away.

Bank Investigator calls (the first time I've spoken to anyone actually investigating anything). She asks me some specific questions, namely the amount of the wire, the originating bank name and account number. And then she drops the bombshell ""I talked with someone on Wednesday who was screaming at me to give them their money but I said I couldn't without confirmation of the info I just asked you for, and sir, while you were on the line just now with the customer service rep, I was speaking to the man again who was pretending to be you!""

My jaw hit the floor. The fucker was STILL TRYING TO GET THE MONEY out of the account and was trying to do it at the same time I was! I nearly shit myself. Thank God for the security measures at the bank. I can't believe that no one was actually on this.

The money was held at capitalone, but no one had reached out to me for confirmation of the details. Clearly the feds and the sheriff had not done any work to get my money back. It was luck, and few security questions that saved me.

A few days later the wire was reversed. We elected to pay into 2016 IRAs, as we had stopped doing so when we decided to move, payed off my last student loan (only a few thousand), repaid the loan from our parents for the 5% down, and are sitting on the remaining $30k or so and will make a decision on what to do with that soon.

Great to be able to give happy updates. We have settled into the new house, kids are happy, SO is happy, and we're not broke, being sued, or having to sue anyone.

For those of you buying a home: always verbally confirm wiring instructions and remember that THEY WILL NEVER CHANGE. If you receive updated wiring instructions, it is increasingly likely that it is an attempt to get you to wire your money somewhere else.

Thanks to everyone for their help.

cpsconcerns,2017-01-31 03:40:10+00:00,[Update] [CO/FL] Boyfriend's family visiting us with a very-likely neglected infant. Need guidance on how to navigate CPS.,"Previous Post: http://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5qyfwh/cofl_boyfriends_family_visiting_us_with_a/

First of all, I want to say thank you to everyone who's offered advice. I recognize it's only been 24 hours since I posted my first question but a lot has happened and you've all been a great help.

Yes, before you ask, I did call CPS. Obviously. I had a talk with Boyfriend last night, told him I absolutely did not want the family staying with us, and reminded him that I'm a mandatory reporter and I had to call this in. (No, seriously. I work in an elementary school and am currently in the process of getting my teaching license. If I didn't report it, that would be my entire career down the drain. No thanks.)

He was mad, which I guess is understandable. But seeing as this isn't a post about my relationship I'll leave it at that.

So last night I stayed at my mother's house, and this morning I called CPS. Turns out Florida CPS was the right one to call because they have jurisdiction over the family. I told them everything I knew, both past issues and present ones. They took my information and that was that. 

I went home, packed up all of my things, and moved everything over to my mother's house. When Boyfriend came home tonight I told him that I had made the call. I then informed him that he is now Ex-Boyfriend.

I don't know what will happen with the baby. I doubt CPS will update me, and now that I've officially removed myself from the family I doubt they'll update me either. I wish I had more to tell you guys, but I don't.

The family won't be staying in our apartment. They've found another family member to stay with in our state. As far as the future of our apartment is concerned, that's something Ex and I plan to discuss tomorrow. Both of our names are on the lease, so we've gotta work together on this.

And me, well... I'll be ok. I'm also quite young (21, for those curious) and I can't help but feel like I've nuked my entire life. My first serious relationship is done, my first ""adult"" place is about to be gone, and I feel like I don't have much left right now. I know I made the right choice and I don't regret it at all, but it still sucks. It's gonna get better though. I'll make sure it does.

I really do wish I had more to share with you, but it seems like this is the end of the legal portion of this issue. Thanks again for all your help, everyone.

Engagementringquest,2017-01-30 22:15:40+00:00,TX - My ex is trying to sue me because I gave her a moissanite ring instead of a diamond ring.,"So we got engaged close to a year ago and broke it off when she cheated. I told her she could keep the ring as I was pissed and wanted no reminders of her. 

Funny thing about it is her friend helped me pick out a ring to buy her... then MY friends told me about moissanite stones that look just like diamonds and cost unbelievably less. So instead of spending 2500ish on a diamond ring, I spent about 150ish on a moissanite ring. 

She never knew that it was a moissanite stone the entire time. 

After the break up she went to have it appraised and was extremely pissed to find out it was barely worth a hundred dollars. 

She is on a rampage on social media and threatening to sue saying I lied and scammed her. 

What should I do here? I am getting a ton of hate from the women on my facebook page. Some are taking it upon themselves to call my job too to complain. I have explained to my boss the ring fiasco and he finds it hilarious. 

But I want it all to stop. Legally what options do I have to stop the harassment? And can she really sue me for giving her a ""fake"" diamond ring?",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5r3zj5/tx_my_ex_is_trying_to_sue_me_because_i_gave_her_a/,legaladvice,1802,41,

inquisitortrevelyan,2017-01-27 09:39:11+00:00,[Update] Dad used Impersonation! ...But nothing happened.,"[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5mwtj7/aus_nsw_dad_used_entitlement_its_sueper_effective/)

Firstly, thank you all for the advice and support last time. I got a lot of good guidance, and it helped make this a much more manageable mountain to tackle. Additionally, I've been amazingly touched by the community banding behind me - I've had not just one but six redditors offer me replacement copies of HG or SS or want to send me rare pokemon. Y'all are amazing.

It's been a fairly hectic couple of weeks, but it seems like my part at least is coming to an end.

* I took a couple of days to get everything together - notarised copies of the forged letter, my receipt for the purchase of the game, a copy of the trade-in terms and conditions for the game store.

 I also contacted my phone company and got them to print my call history, because while I'd blocked the Dad on my phone, that was just auto-rejecting the calls on my end; they were still passing through the carrier. Their logs showed he continued to call ~5-10 times a day after I blocked him (More the first two days, then less as he apparently realised I wasn't answering) and a load of text messages (no idea as to the contents though).

* Once I had everything together I took it to the cops. They filed a report and despatched an officer to go give the guy a 'stop doing that' talk. They gave me a number to call direct if he contacted me again, but didn't feel I needed to look into a restraining order quite yet, which I agreed with.

 The cops were far more interested in the forged letter and asked for it. I made sure I got a case number and a receipt. They headed over to the law firm to confirm/follow up.

* The impersonated law firm was also my next port of call. I gave them a notarised photocopy, a usb with a digital scan and a copy of the case number attached to the original that the police had. They asked me for a written statement as well, I told them I'd let them know.

* Rang my lawyer aunt (albeit corporate law) to confirm if this was something I should do. She said to go ahead, but that to be safe I should have my own lawyer check it over. She pulled in a favour with someone she'd gone through law school with. (Before anyone asks why I didn't go to her earlier - her partner has advanced Alzheimers  which takes a lot of her time/energy so I feel bad about bothering her with things if I don't have to). Sent Aunt copies of everything for another physical back up.

* Lawyer helped me write up the statement properly and checked to make sure there wasn't anything problematic (basically just in case anyone decided to go 'well how do we KNOW that guy sent it maybe YOU'RE trying to set HIM up' - I know, I know, probably paranoia but this whole thing has me on edge). Also drafted a cease and desist letter and sent it to the Dad, along with a denial of responsibility for the charges. Gave lawyer copies of everything.

* Got in contact with head office for the game store. They investigated and talked to the staff member who called me. I was informed they were let go. They also gave me a rather excessive gift card. I feel the amount was far larger than necessary (honestly I wasn't trying to get compensation), so I kept enough to replace the game if another copy turns up and used the rest of it to buy a console and game for one of those 'toys for sick kids' charities. At least *some* good can come of this!

At this point, everything's in a rather murky shade of 'other people doing stuff that I don't know about'. I have a feeling from some comments made that both the cops and law firm are interested in pursuing the impersonation/forgery, but I'm not super involved in the process anymore. At this point, unless I get called back in or the Dad ignores both the cops and cease and desist letter and continues to contact me (knock on wood), I'm pretty much tapping out on my end.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5qg9qw/update_dad_used_impersonation_but_nothing_happened/,legaladvice,1363,1,
TheBashfulPanda,2017-01-26 20:30:47+00:00,[UPDATE] [Louisiana] Huge clerical speed error on ticket requires court appearance,"In [this post] (https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5oid01/huge_clerical_speed_error_on_ticket_requires/) I gave a brief outline of my situation where my speeding ticket was input as a 56 in a 25, but was actually 36 in a 25. 

While everyone told me I would just have to wait for the court date and take it up then, I still wanted to at least get the ticket corrected before then. Knowing the bureaucrats downtown wouldn't be of any help, I went to my local Sheriff Depot. Showed the guy at the desk the ticket, he showed other people the ticket, and they all agreed it was definitely a 3. They went into the computers and changed the ticket to the proper amount. I checked and I am able to pay it online. The cop who wrote the ticket was also apparently known for having terrible handwriting. 

I will still be going to court to sign up for the defensive driving class to get it changed to a non-moving violation. So, if anyone ends up in a similar situation, try going to your local department dressed well and clean shaven and see if they can help. I'm breathing much more easily knowing that the ticket is for the correct speed.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5qcm8y/update_louisiana_huge_clerical_speed_error_on/,legaladvice,1271,1,

Our downstairs neighbor (to whom I'll refer hereafter as Nick), with whom neither my girlfriend nor I associate, is on probation. I don't know Nick, I only see him every so often as one or the other of us is entering or leaving the apartment building. I didn't even know he was on probation until last night when a policeman knocked on our door and told us.

He asked if we had had any contact with Nick and if we had ever ""hung out"" with him, the answer to both questions being No. He said that due to an ""incident"" with Nick, he needs to search our apartment. He wouldn't say what he would be searching for, but I've got a feeling it's drug related.

We told him that we did not consent to his entering our apartment, whereupon he started getting nasty. He said he is empowered by the state to enter our apartment as part of his duties, but I'm pretty sure the search-at-will portion of probation only applies to the person on probation, not their neighbors.

Nonetheless, we told him we would not allow him to enter our apartment unless he had a warrant. He made some thinly veiled threats about obstruction of justice, and then left saying we'd be seeing him again.

The only thing we can surmise is that Nick must have told the PO a lie about us or our apartment.

- We went to our landlord asking if there was another unit available for use to move into in the same complex because we were having some difficulties with our downstairs neighbor. (After reading over the lease requesting a room or building change is allowed for just about any reason as long as there's space available. We might have wound up with slightly higher rent but not so much higher that it would have caused financial problems). Landlord is confused, says the apartment below us is being rented by a woman not a man. We come to find out she's actually been letting him stay there against the terms of her lease. He was her boyfriend or something.

- Not entirely sure what happened next but I'm assuming landlord went and had words with her because he vanishes for two weeks. Yay!

-Come back home a couple days ago, find police cars and an ambulance in front of our building. Turns out he came back and tried to strangle her. One of her kids called 911 and the police managed to get him off of her. 

- She returns the next day. I bring her a casserole (idk it seemed neighborly?) and apologize because honestly had no idea it was going to snowball like this. She tells me not to worry, he was always kind of an abusive ass and he's definitely looking at jail time. Apparently upon doing a more thorough background check the police discovered he's been using someone's stolen identity. Three guesses what kind of warrant they found when they ran the right information? 

Her understanding it was drug related crime, so not like deliberate serial murder but more like things turning ugly in a room full of people. Either way I'm glad he's not coming back. Roomie is.... high strung but I'm optimistic that things will settle back down and she'll be able to breathe properly in about a month. I spent all night last night trying to find a news article to link to but either my google fu is weak or this somehow managed to slip under the radar of the local press.

DeadDrone999,2017-01-16 10:12:20+00:00,Dog ate my Neighbor's Drone - Am I liable? (IL),"Not sure what to do. Earlier today my neighbor came pounding on my door screaming obscenities and shouting at me. When I finally got him to stop yelling I found out that he was flying his drone in my backyard again and this time my dog finally managed to catch it and destroy it. He claims this was a $900 drone and I had to pay him right then and there. I refused and closed the door in his face. A couple hours later police showed up to retrieve the drone; it was still in my yard, but my dog completely ignored it once it stopped buzzing; and ask about the situation. The said neighbor called them stating that I refused him access to my yard to get it. That's not true, he never asked. 

I'm worried the neighbor will try to press charges against me for destruction of property or sue me. Will he have any legal standing if this does go to court?

He has a history of flying his drone low over my yard to tease my dog. I have asked him to stop several times, which he always refuses telling me that I don't own the air above my yard. I have called the police to complain once before, he was doing ""fly bys"" over my dog and getting very close to hitting him. The police didn't say he couldn't fly it in my yard but did ask him to stop doing so in order to avoid conflict. That only seemed to egg him on.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5oa42v/dog_ate_my_neighbors_drone_am_i_liable_il/,legaladvice,1623,333,
Jasonlovestummyrub,2017-01-15 17:34:25+00:00,"Watched 4 yr old son of a couple on Friday. My wife was with him the entire time as he played with my 3 sons (1, 6, and 7). Received call from CPS today saying their son said we ""gave he and our 6 year old a bath and our 6 year old stuck his finger in his bottom"". Unsure what to do?","  So, the title explains most of it.  My wife's friend, Jennifer, asked if we could do a quick babysitting of her 5 year old son just this Friday.  He was here from about 4:00-6:45 with my wife downstairs in our finished basement while I worked in my home office on calls for my employer.  I went down a handful of times to check in and they were just running around the basement with Minecraft weapons, jumping on a bouncy house, and playing video games.   Fast forward to Sunday morning (today) and we received a call from CPS saying that the 5 year old told his parents we had ""given him a bath with our 6 year old son"" and ""he had put his finger in his butt"".   

I'm absolutely livid, confused, and I can't express the types of emotions I'm feeling right now.   I've made it a point many times, to tell my sons to never ever touch anyone outside of themselves and if anyone tried to touch them in a strange way to tell me.   I never wanted anyone going through feeling the type of shame I did, hidden still to present day, in the same way.  

We've never ever in the history of having kids given anyone ELSE's kids a bath or shower.  It's just not something you do.  

This couple, to make it worse, we've known them for 5 years, they literally came to the hospital after our sons were born.  The feel of betrayal and hurt..  my wife is absolutely devastated.

So, my question is this, CPS has said they will send an agent over by Tuesday along with a sheriff.  I have no idea what I should do, if I should have legal contacted?   

I would THINK that a simple explanation can clear this up, though I've read instances of things going horribly wrong in the past.   

Is it a matter of just explaining to the agent the day-of?   Our ""friends"" won't return calls or texts today to talk, so there is no way to express our side of the story.   I'm trying to avoid asking my sons anything about it because I don't want to plant any ideas in their head if they get asked questions.

NewClearHollowCost,2017-01-14 19:12:59+00:00,[TX] I am the non-custodial parent of a 3yo whose mom just went to prison and is now living in a drug den. [UPDATE 4],"Hi everyone! None of the content in the title of the post is relevant anymore but for the sake of consistency it will stay the same. Literally *thousands* of you beautiful strangers have been along for the ride with us on [this journey](https://redd.it/5kbune) and we couldn't be more grateful for all your support, and as promised we will see this thing through till the end- together!  Today is our little human's 3rd birthday and it's been an eventful weekend, so today is a good day to update what's going on with the case:

* I established contact with bio-mom's mom (reluctantly at first, but she has been one of the few constants in his life until now).  She has pledged her support and will do anything she can to see that we win sole permanent custody. That is a huge asset in our corner and we are doing what we can to keep that relationship healthy; sending pictures, updates, videos, etc. We even had little man visit her yesterday. We were in town because:
* the mom was served in prison two weeks ago. The Sherif's Dept sat on the receipt of service and *finally* got it returned to our lawyer on Wednesday.  With the default for the hearing being 14 days from date of service we found out that afternoon that court would be Friday for the temporary orders. Yikes! ""Sorry, boss, I gotta take a personal day.""
* we drove down Thursday night for the 8am hearing yesterday and the judge happily signed off on all of our terms! He's officially under our care now and I don't have to keep subsidizing someone else's meth addiction (child support)! The temporary orders give me managing conservatorship and provide for a restraining order with no visitation against the mom (until the final orders are determined)
* mom was sentenced to 2 years state jail. It's looking like she'll actually serve about 5-6 months so the pressure is on to get the final hearing done before then. The battle will be much less messy and MUCH less expensive that way but we will do whatever it takes. 
* in the meantime we are focusing on being kick ass parents, and you guys I have to tell you that my wife, u/smashtrix, is absolutely winning at this instaparent thing. We are also documenting everything, recording phone calls (1 party consent here in TX), screenshotting texts, cloud back-ups, building a list of good witnesses who would be willing to give depositions or testify in court. 
* we should have a concrete date for the final hearing soon and that will be the next major theater to conquer.
* I was contacted by a gentlemen in a startlingly similar situation because of my original posts and we have been speaking in the real world. Nick, best of luck with you and your son, my man!

All in all it has been the best weekend ever and this is a YUGE step towards absolution. We both feel so much better and love this little microterrorist with everything we got. Reddit, good things are happening and we could NOT have done this without you! This update will probably be comment-locked but feel free to reach out directly with any questions or comments.

The brother of one of my coworkers is a lawyer so I met with him  who chose to advise me for free and I chose to remain silent on the original thread until everything gets settled.  Little more anticlimactic than I thought would happen. 

Went to meet with the fire marshal and he was already up to speed with the chain of events and the fact that the fire alarms were not working and the fact that there was an actual meth lab on 2nd floor.  He informed me he was going to levy a number of fines on the landlord with addition to other things I wasn't aware of.  The tenants who had the meth lab in their apartment were arrested along with having their child taken away from them. Their next door neighbors were the actual minds behind the lab and were also arrested. 

Regarding the landlord saying he was going to sue me, he was just blowing smoke and was full of complete shit and in lieu of lawsuits from other tenants he released everyone  that asked from their lease and paid an undisclosed amount of money to quite a few.  Where did he get this money? Apparently his father is some multimillionaire, but even that couldn't allow him to afford a working fire alarm system within the building. 

That's all the info I have for now. Thanks y'all!",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5nu709/updatelandlord_suing_me_over_doors_i_broke_down/,legaladvice,2274,2,

We get a text if there's a medical emergency in our area, and usually, we can get there before 911 does. I've been fully trained and am CPR and AED certified by the American Hearth Association, and can do other basic medical things. I also have a special badge that identifies me as part of the workplace's emergency response team.

I got a message about a man who had collapsed in my building. When I got to him, he was unresponsive and not breathing, so I followed my training and attached an AED and performed CPR until the paramedics showed up. While performing CPR, I broke one of his ribs, which happens sometimes. The paramedics took him to the hospital, and he survived. 

It turns out he had a do not resuscitate card on him as well, which I didn't know because I didn't check his wallet. He's threatening legal action both for the cost of medical care for his rib, and because I performed CPR when he had a DNR card. 

How much merit is there to his suit? Is it something I should be worried about? Can I expect my employer to help me if he does sue? Thank you!",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5nqq8t/txi_broke_a_persons_rib_while_giving_cpr_to_a/,legaladvice,1897,379,
baddatefromhell,2017-01-11 05:51:09+00:00,TX - Is what I did illegal? On a date with a girl who ordered very expensive stuff against my wishes with her expecting me to pay. I bailed and stiffed her with the check.,"So this was the third date with the girl. First two were pretty normal, kind of expensive but not really. 60 and 80 is not TOO bad for a date. But on the third date she kept making the usual ""uh oh third date"" jokes and kept saying how I would get laid if I treated her right. 

Before the night I told her I was able to pay off my car that day, totally did and its nice not having that in my life, and told her the date might have to be cheap till friday when I get paid again. 

She understood and said she would not be too bad. Well her definition of ""not too bad"" was ordering a 50 dollar steak, an 80 dollar bottle of wine, and crab. FUCKING CRAB in Jan... in TEXAS. I told the waiter in front of her that if she actually orders this I will not be paying for it. I told her to pick something else. She made a scene and I left to go to the bathroom and make a call. 

Called my sister, told her what was happening, my sister gave me the ""called it."" Line saying she thought this girl was a gold digger. I told myself that it was over after this dinner. I would event turn down sex from her... probably. Then I leave the bathroom cooled off and ready to go back... there is an open fucking bottle of wine on the table. 

I asked the waiter how much that bottle costs... He told me 110. I told the waiter that I hope she has the money for it and left. About 45 minutes later I checked my phone seeing over 40 missed text messages and 19 missed calls. I cleared the texts, mostly with her calling me an asshole, I dont know what I am missing, she is amazing in bed and I would never experience it. Then... I am sorry please dont be mad, I really am sorry I was honestly just wanting to have you REALLY treat me for once, seriously come back. ARE YOU GOING TO FUCKING PAY FOR THIS MEAL? 

That last one was the last text I got from her. I responded with an Archer meme. Lana Kane's picture with the word NUUUPE on it. She said she would call the cops on me. I stopped all contact after that. 

So seriously here? Did I do anything illegal? I never ordered anything and told the waiter up front I would not pay for anything super expensive. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5nagk7/tx_is_what_i_did_illegal_on_a_date_with_a_girl/,legaladvice,2026,226,

Straykidthrowaway,2017-01-06 05:56:46+00:00,My teenage son brought a kid home with today. TX,"So my oldest son came home from school today (he rides the bus) with an extra kid. This kid is 17 and says his parents threw him out last July 2 weeks after his birthday. They told him in Texas as a 17 yr old he was an adult. I guess he had been living behind one of the local 7-11's then it got cold. He went to school the first week this year then disappeared, then showed back up today hoping to find a friend to let him stay the night. My son and this kid were friends until he disappeared after school started.

We talked to our son, we talked to the kid. I spent some time looking online for WTF do you do when your kid brings home a stray kid and ran across the national center for homeless kids number. 

I called them, they said to call the police to make sure he hadn't been reported as a runaway. Did that. After an interesting conversation with the police they informed me that the kid hadn't been reported as a runaway or as a missing person and the parents were wrong about him being an adult (which I already knew). They recommended I call CPS. Which I did.

So I called the 800 number for CPS to file a report about this kid. Answered their questions. Which include but are not limited to, yes he can stay here. No he isn't in immediate danger. Yes we're willing to let him stay. No as far as the police are concerned he isn't a run away. Yes we want him back in school. 

So I know someone is supposed to come within the next few days to check on him and talk to us. I guess it's not an emergency because he is currently safe?? Just wondering what exactly my husband and I can expect?

First, I want to say that I logged out of this account that evening, and didn't come back until now, and I was BLOWN AWAY by all of the people offering food, gift certificates, or just good will, and I started crying.. again.  I will respond to each of you individually.

So, to recap: My STBX is a cheating ass, and he panicked and tried to erase his family. 

The update: This all happened on a Sunday, so there wasn't a lot I could do right then. I put the kids to bed, and called my mom and cried. Then, I called my mother in law, who was horrified.

My inlaws came over that night with $200 in cash and a check for much more. My father in law is didn't say much, but he did fix my bathroom door (which is how he shows affection), and muttered that he would ""fix this"".

I opened a new checking account at a new bank (THANKS FOR THIS ADVICE) with the check my in laws gave me.

I opened a new credit card in my name.

My mother deployed a niece to help with childcare for the next week, I called in a lot of childminding favors, and with the cash my inlaws gave me, I was able to pay the babysitter while I worked this out.

I met with two divorce attorneys- both of them told me about what you had said, that he was legally screwed. I chose one, and we set the process in motion to get an emergency hearing, but by Tuesday, my old checking account had *most* of the money back, and my husband was asking to ""talk"".

On the advice of my lawyer, I took half of the checking account money and put it in my new bank, and kept records of everything.  

I pulled our credit reports- He has over $40,000 in credit card debt. I also found out, that he received a raise last year, and funneled this money out of our shared accounts. I would have figured this out when I did our taxes, and this led to him panicking and trying to ""erase"" us. 

Keep in mind, this asshole gave me gonorrhea. I am an accountant by trade, and I'm afraid of CC debt the way some girls are afraid of spiders, so I was horrified about this, but my lawyer thinks it's likely that he'll have to have this debt on his own, as my name isn't on it, and it seems that most of it was spent on his side piece.

We have started mediation, which he agreed to when he realized that he would need to pay for BOTH of our divorce attnys.

My goal- which my lawyer thinks is reasonable, is to ask for alimony until I either re-marry (not likely) or my 2 year old is in school full time, and to have a reasonable amount of child support until she's 18, and then we'll split college costs for all of them. When all the kids are in school, I can concentrate on getting back to work.

I also plan to sell the house and buy a smaller house in a less elite section of town.  The kids can share rooms, and I can live mortgage free. 

So, I'm heartbroken, and diseased, but there's also an incredible weight that his lifted from me. Our marriage has been bad for so long, and I didn't even realize how unhappy I was, and how.. absent by husband was.  It took my 5 year old almost a week to realize that Daddy was gone.

We were having a fight for a few days and i moved a few things over to a friends. Two days later my phone rings from our neighbour asking why there is a fire truck and ambulance at my house. My 5 year old and 13 year old boys were there playing video games while she laid down in bed not feeling well and had a heart attack apparently. Doctors said she went 45 minutes plus without oxygen to her brain. My 13 year old said that the little one came and said that Mum won't wake up. Her parents are acting like i murdered her and swept my children to their house. Her family is huge and I have none. They were my Family. They are telling me that we were separated and it doesn't matter how long. I was a stay at home dad and also worked nights in the family business. I have a Legal Aid lawyer but they have said i need a private bar lawyer to pursue property issues. I have no money for that. They went into my house and took all the legal documents and jewelry. They took her phone and read all of our intimate text messages. I have had a complete mental breakdown and have so far left my children with them as not to upset them any further and have been dealing with this solely by Myself. How can people be like this regardless of their opinion of our life. We were happy and did it on our own. Just trying to type this out and maybe see what anyone else has to say. I am so confused and broken. Why do these people think my children should lose both parents because we were in a deep argument. 16 years, 10 months and 30 days we were together. House paid off. We must have been doing something right but not according to these people. I am no perfect angel but my heart has always been in the right place. They are very wealthy. All of a sudden my Daughter wont take the phone to speak to me which was a complete surprise yesterday. We did family hugs and said i love you daily. I have always been there and been over the top protective. If they had a problem with my parenting why have they never said it before and now tell me they are ""protecting"" them? I was always a good loving Dad. I am so worried about my children these people are not what my kids need. they need to be with me. They have been with me their entire lives and now this? How can they do this? I miss her so much. I want to comfort my children. They told me to get my ""stuff"" together and in the future I can be the Dad again and they will be the Grandparents. Wth? Who made them the powers of the universe. I need help.

To give everyone an update, it's resolved. My boss, who was on vacation, saw that e-mail and called up the HR assistant who sent it and asked him just what in the fuck he thought he was doing.  

Apparently Judy went to HR claiming discrimination and bullying, fully omitting the fact that she's destroyed countless documents in the exact same way.  

My boss, also her boss, sent out an e-mail saying nobody would be fired and to disregard the misinformed information. He pulled Judy into his office and basically said to her that while he's turned a blind eye to the issues she creates because it's too much of a headache, that he's not going to stand behind her when somebody does exactly the same to her. He told her that she should have expected this to happen and that if it was so important, it's her fault for waiting until the very last day to fill out the renewal and not saving a copy. He also said that if she ever threatens another employee with termination that her seniority will not save her.  

He pulled me in, told me the above, and told me he knows damn well that I probably shredded her document. He says he doesn't give a shit, but that he's going to send out an e-mail with a blanket statement saying that anyone who removes another individual's print job without their permission will face discipline. Put it on their desk, put it in the plastic organizer on the wall, or don't touch it.

I really appreciate your all giving up time to do this. This is part update (first chunk) and then answers to questions (second chunk). 

So I lawyered up with a decent firm I’ve used before, and a day or two subsequently I was officially served with notice I am being sued for intentional infliction of emotional distress.

I didn’t state it in my first post because I thought it was not relevant but if any of the girls want to remove their poster they just need to let me know and it will be taken down immediately – although obviously they lose their free month of drinks. This is clearly written on the form they signed, which they all have a copy of. So I knew from the start it wasn’t a case of regret and the girl wanting the poster down. 

One of the first things my lawyer did was check with the girl’s firm if it was real and not a scam as several posters had suggested. Unfortunately, it was a real case, they provided all the documentation and stuff. It gets worse. They also sent him a scan of the girl’s passport and birth certificate when he asked, both confirming she is 16. They’ll be brought up in the lawsuit so there’s no question of them also being fakes. I checked her real info provided by the lawyers and compared it with the form and [as I now know] fake driving license she gave me. She used the same address on the fake ID but just changed her last name. It is clearly the same girl in both photos. 

She doesn’t want to bring the police into it and wants just a civil case. My lawyer met with hers and, just as /u/thewhitenashorne and other FL attorneys had suggested, made noise about how her possessing a fake ID is a felony and how about she just drop the suit and we stay even stevens unless she wants the police involved, but her lawyer basically told mine that it would be far worse for me if we got the police involved because of it being a naked minor, and also the threat of having my liquor license taken away, like basically as my lawyer explained it they have two cards to play (photos of a minor naked, potential confiscation of liquor license) and I have one of a much lower value (girl has a fake ID that's only a DL, not a passport or green card).  

Anyway, I have removed the poster and have locked it and the memory card with all the photos in the safe. 

I have had warnings in the past at the first bar I owned to ID more strictly (I’m from Europe where we’re more relaxed) and at this one too but we ask for a driving license/passport for everyone now so the police are happy. The guy telling me I accept fake IDs is wrong: I just do the bare minimum when it comes to accepting licenses because my business is serving alcohol to college kids, not being border patrol.  To the poster who asked, I have no idea whether or not it is allowed but loads of FL clubs and bars confiscate fake ID, particularly during spring break. 

To reiterate since some people were double checking this – yes, I collected and photocopied ID from all of the girls concerned alongside the forms they filled out. It is easy to match the forms with the relevant posters since I can compare the ID and the poster photo. 

I have notified the photographer although he is not named in the lawsuit. He told me he has insurance against this exactly for this sort of thing (he’s an erotic photographer) so wasn’t too bothered as I had done checks and asked for ID. The photos weren’t in his online portfolio as I had paid extra so I had sole ownership of the photos – he has no copies. 

I have checked with my insurers who will indeed cover this. The fact I have consent forms and proof of age made them and my lawyer a lot more happy. 

While some bars do indeed let younger people in, my bar’s policy is always 21+ only. The only way that girl got in was with a fake ID – she should not have been there legally. 

On an non legal point – I have received several abusive PMs about this competition, calling me a paedo, a rapist, a “scumsucking sleazoid” and so on. This competition was completely legal and completely consensual. I have run these sorts of competitions before in my bar every couple of years and have never had any problems yet. I appreciate that the bars some of you may frequent are not run on the same model or are higher class that mine, but bars like mine work this way. Cheap alcohol at a bar near frat and sorority houses means I make a killing and this just encourages business. If you disapprove that I don’t own an expensive trendy hipster bar aimed at young professionals, serving pumpkin spiced craft beer with Lena Dunham quotes on the walls, just ignore the post. Don’t PM me a load of self moralising abusive bullshit.

I have also received two PMs asking me where exactly my bar is in Miami since they fancy coming for a drink. It doesn’t seem wise to reveal this stuff on the web – particularly in the middle of all this -  so sorry, no. 

That’s all for now. Obviously if anything happens I will update at the end of the case. My lawyer has said I should hold fire on updating you till then. Thank you all once again for your help.

rackerson3,2016-12-20 18:45:56+00:00,"[PA] Employer blocked out all opportunity to use paid time off for the month of December, now they're stating that any unused PTO will disappear at the end of the year. Layoffs may follow in January.","I've generally received some sound advice here before, so I'm back again to ask a question on behalf of my brother in law. 

His employer offers a fairly standard PTO package where employees earn a specified amount of PTO for each hour worked, up to a maximum that is dependent on years of service and current position. 

On the last day of November, the company announced that they were ""blacking out"" the entire month of December for any non-emergency time off. 

On the first day of December, they announced a new policy taking effect December 1st, that any PTO accumulated but unused by midnight December 31st would no longer be available for the next calendar year. Meaning if you don't use it when they won't allow you to use it, you will not be able to use it at all. 

This has caused some considerable consternation among the employees, as you can imagine. Everyone is trying to find an angle to get their time off approved before it disappears, and basically no one is able to take any time off. 

Is this a legal maneuver? I am aware that most employers are required to pay time off at the time of separation, BUT I also know that employers are allowed to cap the amount of PTO earned or decide not to allow it to rollover from year to year. 

The specific issue here seems to be that they have blocked off all ability to use any existing PTO and then changed the policy after the fact to avoid paying what is already owed. Further, there is serious discussion about laying people off starting mid-January. This would allow them to dodge their current obligation towards employees who have accrued but not used their PTO.

Any advice would be appreciated. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5jeybc/pa_employer_blocked_out_all_opportunity_to_use/,legaladvice,1121,89,
pharmfire,2016-12-19 20:19:28+00:00,Was fired because I wouldn't put my boss on the list of people that can access my protected health information at my pharmacy (medication for disability)?,"TN. I take medication daily, a controlled substance with a strict 30 day refill schedule. The condition it treats is documented in my employee file. My direct supervisor and I have a good relationship, and she knows that some months, I'm only able to get the medication from the pharmacy on the weekday morning of the first available day. This has led to me being about 20 minutes 4 times over the last year. My direct supervisor allows this and it's documented in my file as it relates to a disability.

On Thursday night, I went to pick up my prescription but was told they wouldn't have it ready until the next morning. So I text my supervisor and told her I'd be 20ish minutes late again. No response, but that's pretty normal. Friday morning, I pick the prescription up and head to work. I'm greeted by my supervisor's boss, who technically is also my ""boss"" but indirectly. He asks if I realize I'm late ""again"", and I explained the pharmacy situation and my supervisor's understanding of that. He says he doesn't think it's appropriate that this has happened more than once, and he wants to know what pharmacy I use. I told him and he dismissed me from his office. An hour later, my pharmacy calls me and tells me they've had someone call them to ask questions about my medications and health status. He wouldn't tell them who he was, and they obviously told him that it's protected information and they were going to tell him nothing. They were just calling me to inform me of a possible security issue, especially because two of my medications are ""high abuse potential"" meds.

He (supervisors boss) comes back to my office and tells me that he needs me to add him to my list of ""contacts"" at my pharmacy so he can confirm that the reason I've been late this year is because of that. I have a host of other health problems that work doesn't know about (intentionally), and it's also just way too personal, so I tell him no. I offer to show him my receipt or prescription bottle, and he declined. And walked out. I tried to get ahold of my supervisor, but she is apparently out of town for something work related.

So this morning, my supervisor's boss calls me in again and tells me that I'm being terminated because of unexcused tardies. I didn't even know how to handle it so I didn't say much and I packed up and left.

I feel like something here is wrong. I know about at will employment and ADA accommodations and such, but I'm having a hard time placing this. I feel like I was fired for refusing to add my boss to a very personal medical access list that would've given him much more power than was necessary. I offered to bring receipts, a claim statement from my insurance for the days filled, but that wasn't enough for some reason.

We're in Ohio. I need a divorce lawyer. On Wednesday, I bought him a fucking Christmas present. On Thursday, I found out he gave me a STI. On Friday, he admitted he's been cheating. Yesterday, he drained our accounts. He says I need to be out of the house by Christmas Eve.  

We have four kids, 8, 6,5 and 2. I haven't worked since the oldest was born. Our relationship has been bad since before my youngest daughter was born- we hadn't meant to get pregnant. This week, I tested positive for an STI. I investigated, confronted him and he admitted it. We had a huge fight, he stormed out of the house.
Yesterday, my credit card was declined at the grocery store, and I couldn't get cash. He has EMPTIED all of our accounts. I was in charge of the bills and finances; I know exactly how much was in our checking, savings and money market account. He's changed his password for his 401(k). He didn't respond to my frantic texts all day, but just sent me an email saying I had a week to get myself and ""my kids"" out of ""his house"", and I had better get a job or go ""back to my parents"" if I expect to feed them.
We bought the house together, before the kids were born and I paid half of the down payment. I have no money or credit cards, so I can't even get a lawyer. I am sitting here staring at a Christmas tree, crying and wondering if I'll have to return my children's presents for food. I have no idea how this happened. I live two hours away from my family, so even if I got a job, I'd have to pay for day care. Should I sell my wedding and engagement rings? Do I make a resume and apply for a job in my old field (accounting) or just get a job at Starbucks or McDonald's? Can he do this?

We came here four days ago looking for some advice and what we actually got was an outpouring of support, encouragement and wisdom that has been just overwhelming.  One thing led to another and you people basically threw us an impromptu international baby shower. You made a grown ass man cry numerous times (and my wife, who isn't a graceful crier at all), and the UPS guy isn't happy with you lot, either!  Over the next few days we suddenly and miraculously had everything we needed to welcome this awesome little guy into our lives and our home. All we needed now was the human! So...

* We negotiated with the involves parties to get him for the Holidays. Plot twist: we don't plan on giving him back. 
* We hired an attorney who is pretty fired up about the whole situation and motivated to win. I want to make something crystal freaking clear here: if it weren't for your generosity with the essentials, we wouldn't have been able to hire an attorney and would he flying solo on this case. You are saints. 
* Custody petition is being filed now, and the mother will be process served in prison in the next week or so. The hearings should move pretty quickly (fingers crossed!). 
* We brought him home today!  CPS acted as a proxy and doesn't want information or addresses exchanged between us and the family who were temporarily charged with caring for him and the exchange was pretty diplomatic and smooth. 
* For now he is under the impression that he's on vacation with us and we are sticking with first names only. On your advice we don't want to force a narrative and want this transition to play out on his terms and his time, not ours. 
* We are all snuggled up on the couch watching some god awful dinosaur cartoon on Netflix and having snacks!  He is already having so much fun on his 'vacation'. He's such a cool little dude.

Throwawaydiscrimnati,2016-12-17 00:35:35+00:00,(Massachusetts) My boss fired me after finding out that I'm not Hispanic.,"When I was interviewed and hired(a year ago) , I was asked what the greatest struggle was in my life. I answered moving to America, I spoke about my parents and I arriving with 5 suitcases and struggling to find a place to live even though my dad had a good job, having no family or friends.

My background is German and Eastern European Jew. I'm fairly tan with dark curly hair but my first and last name reflect my heritage very clearly.

Earlier this week one of my coworkers was asking about what I'm doing for the holidays, I mentioned that my family celebrates both Christmas and Chanukah.

My boss overheard and asked why I celebrated Chanukah. I said that I'm ethnically Jewish and my family's from Germany, Ukraine and Russia/Finland. She mentioned that she thought I was Hispanic and walk away.

This morning she called me into her office and fired me for ""lying about my race"", said that I used ""struggles and turmoils that weren't mine to get the job"".

I also have an email that she accidentally sent to me(she sent business wide, everyone got it) stating that I was fired for pretending to be Hispanic and stealing other people's struggles.

I never claimed to be Hispanic, when I told her that it's discrimination she said that only minorities can be discriminated against.

1. She's wrong about this,right?

Also I wish I could make a MS paint diagram about this situation, I might try and download an app on my phone after posting this. 

Anyways, I was on the go train, basically a commuter train, it wasn't too busy but someone sat across from me diagonally.  I had McDonald's as I was in a rush, got gassy, was holding it in but it was a bit bumpy and I let a fart out. 

It smelled bad, so I said I'm sorry, was trying to hold that in.  Person proceeds to flip out,saying I have to give them my name since I ""assaulted them with noxious fumes"".  I was fairly confident you can't be arrested for farting so I just told them to ""pound sand"" and call the cops or security.  I was even polite enough to say I'd even stay at the stop until they came to tell them that the person was an idiot. 

Nothing ended up coming of it, they stormed off, I heard nothing else about it. 

Now my question is twofold, was it assault? Was it bad I apologized and admitted fault initially? 

Also I should note that when they were flipping out, my initial embarrassment turned into me laughing at them, which basically antagonized them more.  At that point I couldn't help it, not sure if that changes the answer. 

I tried to search fart in legaladvice here, but besides usernames I didn't see much.  Sorry if this is a dumb post.

First of all I want to explain what happened, apologize and thank all of you. 

Long story short, as soon as her boyfriend came in she started crying hysterically. I told them that I'm video recording them through my phone but they seemed uninterested in what I said. She started blaming him for all sorts of stuff, he kept apologizing a lot, and after what seemed like an eternity, she packed her stuff and they were both gone.

Now, I've written down on a piece of paper all your different advice. I'll file a restraining order against her. I'll also go file a police report and talk to the sheriff explaining everything that happened. I've documented all I could. I have screenshots of her IG account with the pictures tagged to AZ. Plus the video of her and her boyfriend arguing in my house and then packing and leaving together. 

My mom's main concern right now is getting the protective order ASAP and installing an alarm system in my house. She said she'll be staying with me until we can get a company to install an alarm system on Monday. Thank you guys for suggesting to call my mom. It made me feel safer while she was here. 

Apology: I know how annoying it was for you guys to keep giving me advice that I should file the restraining order and go to the police only to find me not do any of them but invite a stranger to my house. My mom also pointed out how badly this could've gone with her boyfriend coming here.

 /u/GiveHerTheWorks
&gt; I've been thinking about this since I read it. Honestly, I hope it's fake. If the cops showed up and this lunatic told them she was a tenant, why would OP not say something like ""Fine, prove to them you live here. Where's your lease? Where are your keys? Where do you sleep? Show them your license with this address. Show them a piece of your mail addressed here.""

I wish you where there with me man and pointed those things out. It just took me off guard. I just stood there saying nothing.

Anyway, I'm so lucky it didn't go worse. I'm just really relieved this whole thing is off my chest now. I'm truly thankful for each one of you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5hhr7g/final_update_a_friend_of_mine_broke_into_my_house/,legaladvice,2324,1,

The policeman said (to my surprise) to the neighbor that they would have to pay for my jeans ($120) or their dog would be ""potentially euthanized"" for the bite (there was blood but it was from the dog's claws).

Now the neighbors are telling me that if their dog is put down they will sue me for $4500 in Small Claims Court because their dog was from a breeder, and that ""you are welcome to counter-sue us for your jeans but you'll come out the loser here if you press charges.""

This sounds ridiculous to me, I don't want their dog to be killed (just put on a damn leash) and while I would like my jeans replaced this is far too much drama for me and I want to stop charges from being pressed or not be sued.

What do I do now?","I have a friend who called me last night asking for a place to stay. I politely told her no. She's 25, I'm 19 and I should mention she's a narcissistic bitch. Today I was over at my cousin's place this morning and when I came home a couple of hours ago I found this bitch inside my house. No signs of a break in from the outside.

I ask her how she got in and she tells me through the back window. I tell her I never gave you permission to come here and that she needs to leave immediately and she says ""deal with it"".

I call the cops and tell them that there's a person who got inside my house without my permission and that I need an officer to come and remove her. A couple of minutes later they arrive and here's what happens. She tells them ""I know my rights officers I've been a legal tenant in this house for two months now and you can't just remove me. I can go around show you my clothes in the wardrobe. My toothbrush and my conditioner in the bathroom and all of my other stuff."" .. they take a walk with her and all of her fucking stuff is all over my house!! 

She fucking broke into my house, put her stuff all over so that the cops would think she's been a tenant. 

The next thing they tell me is that I have to serve her with an eviction notice and that they can't legally remove her since she's considered a tenant. I didn't even know what to tell them as I felt so dumbfounded and shocked I was set up like this. I was silent for a few seconds and so they try to explain how the law works to me but since I just keep looking at them in silence not believing myself they just proceed to leave.

I'm so fucking pissed. I'm in California so I can't even record her confessing to what she's done. If I can do that under an exception I could easily do it because apparently she has no problem admitting to it when the cops aren't here. I'm not, however, going to do so if it will lead to more problems. I've also thought about calling 911 or the non-emergency line and telling the operator about the situation so that the call would be recorded and then make my ""friend"" confess about it. Can I do that? Me and the operator are aware of the call being recorded. I think it still would be unlawful.

How do I get this bitch out without having to serve her eviction notice? Isn't that against the law what she did there? Isn't this fraud? I've thought about trying to prove that she's been living somewhere else before but I don't know what to do. This is fucked up.

I'm really sorry about my language but I'm really feeling so angry and I'm trying to be calm as much as I can while she's in my fucking house using my stuff and I can't do shit about it.

Purpleroxs,2016-12-03 13:32:57+00:00,My son (4) is being subpoenaed to juvenile court to testify against my husband. I'm slightly terrified...,"Location: Louisiana 

About 8 months ago, my husband was arrested for DA-stragulation. My husband was trying to kill me after I stood up on his mother mooching off of me since they both weren't really working. Our son witnessed the whole thing. Husband pleaded guilty to DA- misdemeanor and was given a year no contact order, domestic violence counseling, and pay court costs and fines.

I went and filed cs after his dad (through our third party) promised to send some cash to help his son get school supplies, but I waited 2 months and never got one cent.

Cs was granted in less than two weeks and thats when the shit hit the fan.

Since then, his mother and family have being trying to get me to modify the order in order for him to see his son, but I refuse to pay money to have that happen. Plus she's threaten to beat me up in front of my son for her son being arrested. She said I was stupid to call the cops and should have just let him be.

In fact, I had to delete all his family members off of fb because I'm getting trashed for the whole thing.

Anyway, this whole ordeal has been hard on my son because he used to being around his dad. We lost our place of residence due to this crap since the apt company evicted him, but let me stay and stuck me with a $4k back rent after they rented the place out to someone esle.

I went through my local probono center where they took the case for a divorce and getting the apartment situation fixed.

My son is just now moving on and has come down alot about the whole event, but I fear that this will wound him up again. Before getting psy help, he was biting, pushing, scratching, screaming for his old room back and his dad, extremely clingy, and was defiant.

I also fear that my son won't take this seriously if he's being asked questions. He's four.

For anyone that has experience in cases like this, what can I expect? Do you think of I take this to the Probono center, they will try and stop this from happening?

Thanks.


Edit: Holy smokes guys! I wasn't expecting this much feedback...

Update: I spoke to a family friend that use to practice family law and he pretty much said everything that everyone has been saying: contact the Probono clinic (ASAP) and send/give them a copy of the notice to appear in court. Call his therapist and not only get the report from the psy, but also his eval of his progress after the incident, also, stay on the clinic to ensure that they have a lawyer/advocate  with my son in case I'm not allowed to be with him.

Again, you guys have no idea how much the advice has helped me. The whole thing is about a month and a few days from today so maybe I can post an update of the situation in the hopes that if someone is going through a similar situation, this may help them a bit.

LegaltoSue,2016-12-02 19:06:19+00:00,"Update: Terminated, company says I can't sue (NY)","[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5ca7zr/terminated_company_says_i_cant_sue_ny/) 

Quite a bit has happened in the last few weeks. A friend of mine at another company, after hearing what happened told me his company had an opening. I applied, interviewed, and at the end the manager asked me what i liked to be called.  

Two days later I got a call saying they'd gone with another candidate. My friend admitted to me that he'd gotten some flack for recommending me. Apparently HR had worked with one of the employees at my former company, and called the employee to ask what the deal was with me.  

To which the employee responded, ""He got fired for sexually assaulting a subordinate. I think he's actually being charged criminally.""  

I'm literally crying as I type this. It's a nightmare that won't end.  

Long story short, I lost my shit, called up my old company, boss wouldn't get on the phone with me. Had an attorney draft a letter of demand and send it off. Had another phone conference scheduled.  

They once again ""regret"" that an employee provided a reference outside of the prescribed channels. The employee was coached on the proper way to handle such requests.  

My attorney informed them that in addition to wrongful termination, we would be adding defamation to our complaint against them. They insist that they have not broken any laws and they cannot control the actions of an individual employee who went against company policy.  

So we're at an impasse there. Either I move ahead against them, or I walk away. At this point I'm ready to drag this through court. I tried to take the high road and go elsewhere, but they're ""regretting"" a lot that they've done to me without any action to correct it.  

Oh! I almost forgot. A few days after my last post, they sent me a packet of papers. Standard nondisclosure notifications, COBRA, and a blank copy of the arbitration agreement for me to sign!  

Why a blank one, you ask? Well it seems somebody fucked up! They weren't making people sign when I was hired, and HR never bothered to have me sign when the agreement when I worked there.  

I of course have signed nothing that they sent me including that agreement.  I considered allowing arbitration if they pay the costs and I have approval over who is selected, but my attorney has advised not to do that.  

I wish I had better news to report. Things aren't as hopeless as they'd first seemed, but not as easily fixable either.  

As for the employee who made the accusation, I know you're eager to hear, but at this point I can't comment on what's happening there.  

Thanks for all of the advice and support so far. I promise to update when everything resolves, if not sooner, as much as I can.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5g52v8/update_terminated_company_says_i_cant_sue_ny/,legaladvice,1432,2,
firefirepants,2016-11-28 13:59:22+00:00,Landlord left door unlocked with a note saying so. Everything of value was stolen.,"I reported a maintenance issue to my landlord and he scheduled a repair person to come last Friday.  The landlord asked me to be there, I told him I couldn't, he asked me to leave the door unlocked, I told him I couldn't.  I asked him to be there for the repair, and he agreed.

He apparently came over late Thursday and unlocked the door, then put a note on it to the company literally SAYING the door was unlocked and asking them to lock it when they leave. 

I arrived home on Saturday night to find that the company never actually showed up and the door had been unlocked the whole time.  Everything of value was stolen and a number of things that weren't valuable were still broken/vandalized. 

I filed a police report. Then, since my landlord had agreed to be there for the repair person, I contacted him thinking he must have forgotten to lock up.  That's when I learned that he just came over and unlocked it a day early and left it that way.

I know it has only been a day, but so far my landlord takes no responsibility with what happened and I am afraid that won't change.  Is there anything legal I can do?

I need to go through the purchases but I believe the total amount of items stolen and items damaged is about $15,000 that I paid.

(It won't be covered by rental insurance, BTW, already looked into it.)

explodeybrain,2016-11-26 12:46:35+00:00,"[NSW, Australia]. My bf out of the blue took my beloved old dog to a vet to be put to sleep secretly. Is what he did likely to be massively illegal? What steps can I take to protect myself before he returns tomorrow.","I have a dog, Sticksy, who's 11. Yesterday morning my bf left to go up the coast to see family. He doesn't return until sunday night.

By sheer luck and nothing else, an ex flatmate of mine working at a vet clinic 80km from me called me while I was at work and asked if a dog someone had brought in to be put to sleep was my Sticksy. It was. I had him hold Sticksy and I collected him friday. My flatmate showed me a recording he made of security video at the vet clinic and it's definitely my ex dropping sticksy off.

How illegal is this? I currently live in a flat that I rent, and my bf pays half but I'm the only one on the lease. I want him out asap, or I want to be out of this situation as soon as possible. What options do I *not* have? A friend of mine once tried to have a violent ex removed and it took months. I want to be out of this immediately. Are my only options to move? How do I protect myself from what my bf (ex to me now though he doesn't know it yet) may do to the place I rent when I return. I presume my landlord couldn't kick him out if I leave right away. He's never shown any weird tendencies before so maybe I'm overthinking this. My bf doesn't know I know what he did nor that I have sticksy back.

Sorry for the scattergun of questions. I'm scatterbrained at the moment and he only returns in 20 hours or so and I don't ever want to see so much as a hair on his head again.

**Edit and a quick update**. A night's sleep with good people around me helped. I phoned a workmate to see if I could go stay there with sticksy, and she came over here for the night instead. We spoke, and we have a plan. Thank you for the links to NSW laws, it looks like I might be in the clear with forcing my ex out. I am the renter, I am the only name on the lease, and we had no written agreement. From my understanding he is a boarder or lodger and can be removed quickly. I'll have to clarify of course but that gives me confidence. I was freaking out because I didn't know where to start last night.

My ex will be confronted with more people I know in the house backing me up.

Sticksy is also in good health. He's eleven and a bit too fat and slower than he used to be but he's fine. These photos are from early november when we visited a property out of town. He started life as a farm dog and going back made his day. http://imgur.com/a/7WaG5

He's not microchipped. I'm taking a personal leave day Monday and getting him chipped first thing.

**update2**

He came back. He lied. I was upset and looked it. we gave him enough rope to make excuse after changing excuse. First he was shocked sticksy was gone, and would help look for him. Then he was shocked someone took him to a vet to be put down. Then when confronted with proof it was him, he claimed sticksy was hit by a car and he had to end his suffering. When confronted with a live happy sticksy he turned it around and it ended with him telling me he should have had me put down.

My coworker and her partner and I told him he was not welcome in the house any more and that they were moving in with me, and everyone in the house (and the neighbour we both get on well with who saw him return on Friday to take sticksy) now knows what kind of person he was. He left of his own accord and took some of his stuff. I'm no closer to knowing for sure why he tried what he did. Sorry for jamming up legaladvice with this one, it wasn't much of a legal ending.

aerowyn,2016-11-16 13:05:49+00:00,"Called the cops to report a burglary, they accused me of staging it then arrested my wife on false charges.","A lot of bad things happened in one night.  To start off, I was robbed.  The guys who robbed me took my house keys and my wallet containing my home address on my drivers license.  They tried to take my car too but my wife had the key and she wasn't there at that moment.  When the cops came I asked them to check my house in case they used my address and keys to go rob my house, but the officer told me that they wouldn't waste time doing something like that because they were probably just trying to use my credit cards.

So I returned home to find my house had been robbed.  I saw that in my bedroom every drawer was open and all of our clothes were in a pile in the middle of room, along with everything from the closets.  Even the bed had been moved.  I immediately called the cops and did not enter the room to preserve any evidence.

The problem is the cops took one look at the mess and said it looked like my wife was just trying to pack some clothes in her suitcase.  Her suitcases were lying in the middle of the room because they had been in the closet, but they were empty.  Also my own suitcase was lying on the floor, but somehow they still only saw her suitcase and clothes and leapt to this assumption.

One strange thing was that our large TV and computer had not been taken, only some smaller things like a camera and Xbox controller.  I couldn't tell them how much had been taken because I hadn't looked through the house yet and everything was in a big pile.  For some reason they considered this further evidence it was all fake.  I realized later that we live in a gated community and it's possible they had to hop the wall to get in, which would have prevented them from carrying away the TV or anything large.

I begged them to collect evidence so they could find the people who did this but they refused.  They did about a 1 minute search and then interrogated us for about a half hour outside, during which I was yelled at by one of the cops for staging the burglary.  They then arrested my wife for domestic violence.

We'd had an argument before the cops arrived about her phone (did I mention we were having a bad night?), but it included no violence and the only injuries I had were from being robbed earlier.  I suspect they did this to punish me.

I just got my copies of the police reports that were filed for the burglary and domestic violence and it's clear the officers lied in the reports.  They listed several reasons why the burglary appeared to be staged that are entirely false, not a result of confusion or an honest mistake, but complete fiction.  Things like plates and pictures on the ground that were undamaged because they must have been placed there, not consistent with a random search.  Well, we have no framed pictures on our walls and our plates are plastic and don't shatter.

I have pictures of the damage that I took before the police arrived proving the report is false.

There's another thing.  A neighbor was walking by before the police showed up who got involved with the argument.  He tried to de-escalate the situation and it kind of helped, but according to the report he told the officer he heard my wife beating me through an open door.  Not only did she not do that, I'm 90% certain this guy did not even say that to the police.

I am planning to talk to him about this.  If the report is false and he never made that claim, what can we do to prove the report false in court?  This account is the only actual evidence they have of violence, except for the scratches and bruises I sustained from being robbed an hour earlier.  And even if he did say that to the police, how would him hearing through an open door the sound of my wife beating me be considered conclusive evidence?

We don't have a lot of money to hire a lawyer for this, even less now that we're recovering from the theft of $2-3k worth of belongings.  We didn't have insurance that covers burglary either (another good reason why we didn't fake it) and bail was another several hundred dollars.

Basically, I would have been better off not calling the cops.

So what can we do about all this?  What's the best way to fight the charges in court, and do we have any recourse for the false police report the officer filed?",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5d92jc/called_the_cops_to_report_a_burglary_they_accused/,legaladvice,1622,188,

-Cottage-,2016-10-30 15:41:06+00:00,"FINAL UPDATE: Toronto - Landlord let cleaners into my condo without consent. $1,700 worth of property stolen","What’s up /r/legaldvice? I have received some messages from people asking about how this ended, so I’m back with my final update on this thing. You may recall my last two threads:
https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/4cnlz7/toronto_landlord_let_cleaners_into_my_condo/
https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/4cse80/update_toronto_landlord_let_cleaners_into_my/ 

This is going to be long. There’s  a tl;dr at the end.

After those threads, I felt like I was probably correct in pursuing the landlord, but the comments were a bit of a mixed bag of advice. As I said I would, I sought council here in town. I saw a paralegal that was supposedly in this area of law, referred through the Law Society. What an enormous waste of time.

After I explained the entire situation to the paralegal and how I didn’t know if I should go after the property manager at the tenant board, or the cleaner in small claims, or both in small claims; the guy basically despondently nodded and said, “Yeah… That’s a real tough one… What do you want to do?”

It was frustrating that a legal professional in Toronto couldn’t give me any better direction than Reddit. I left no wiser than I arrived, and decided to just go through the process with the LTB and feel it out. It didn’t feel worth my time or money to seek additional council.

There was a preliminary hearing at the LTB in April where the property manager and I were each allowed to give our version of events, attempt mediation, and then the board member would determine if the case would go to a formal hearing. After telling my side of things, the property manager didn’t dispute any of the events. The board member said that the cleaner was an agent of the landlord, and advised the property manager they would be required to pay any damages to me that may be awarded. This was very good to hear, as it finally confirmed I was correct to go after the property manager and not the cleaner.

The property manager was cooperative and was pleasant enough to deal with. The board member asked us if we would attempt a settlement. So far, the cleaner had offered $600. The PM said they would add $400 to that for a total of $1,000. I said I would not take less than the full value of my items listed, because I was confident I could prove their value beyond what they offered at a hearing. No settlement was agreed on. That was unsurprising and made sense to me. Even though the PM was not contesting the events and was likely going to be ruled against in a formal hearing, it was in their interest to make me prove the value of my stuff and get an order from the board for that amount. Then they could use the order to sue the cleaner later. If they settled it could be difficult to get the money from the cleaner.

At the end of the preliminary hearing, the board member took down a “Statement of Agreed Facts” to expedite our next hearing, since we didn’t disagree on any of it. I’m not going to list them, but the gist of it is that they gave their copy of the key to my apartment to a third party without my consent and they removed my belongings from my apartment. It was very clear they weren’t fighting me on that.

The formal public hearing where the board would determine damages was a couple months later. I had receipts (mostly Paypal confirmation emails) for about $1,200 worth of my things that were taken. Then I had $400 worth of stuff where I had pictures of me wearing it with identifying brand markings and stuff showing, with print outs from web sites where it could be purchased to show the monetary value. Then about $200 worth of stuff where all I had was pictures because they were irreplaceable items that I paid cash for. I had my girlfriend as a witness to what was taken and to confirm brands of clothing items. The full value of the items was over $1,800.

I was expecting to be awarded $1,200 at least for the items I could prove exactly how much I paid for, which is why I didn’t settle for $1,000, but wasn’t confident about the rest of it. 

Before the hearings for the day started, the board member called out our names and said “Are you sure you can’t settle this one with the mediator this morning? I’m looking at the agreed facts here and…” He looked over at the landlord and kind of shrugged as if to say the hearing is a formality at this point. Nonetheless, the landlord wouldn’t budge on it, so we waited 4 hours until we were called up for our hearing.

After we went through all of the documents item-by-item, the property manager was given the floor. He tried to dispute the items that did not have receipts – specifically a pair of jeans worth over $300 (Yes, seriously.) The board member said that it’s not a criminal case, and it’s not up to me to prove beyond a reasonable doubt every single item I listed (Referenced *Maldonado v. M.E.I.,* [1980]). The burden of proof I had to meet for a civil matter like this was met through what I had provided. As the PM elected not to bring any experts, witnesses, etc. that could argue against the values I had stated, or to say the items I was wearing in the pictures did not match the products in the evidence I produced, he had no reason not to believe me. The board member said he did not even want to hear from my witness, because the evidence I produced was substantial, and there was no contest from the property manager beyond “it’s not a receipt”.

The board member ruled in my favour for the full amount that we discussed for each item at the hearing, and I received the order stating such a week or so later in the mail. On my way out of the hearing I asked the landlord what they were going to do. He said they had no interest in fighting it and would be getting the cleaner to pay for it.

A week or two later I received the cheque in the mail, from the cleaner. This was a few months ago now, the cheque cleared and the matter is resolved.

Thanks to everyone that offered their advice and comments in the other threads.

**tl;dr:**  Had a hearing at the tenant board and won. I didn’t have receipts for everything but the board member ruled that it’s not a criminal case and I didn’t have the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt what the value of my belongings were. I provided enough evidence combined with the fact that it was uncontested by the landlord, so I was awarded the full replacement cost of everything I lost - over $1800.

ScrewedByCustomer,2016-10-29 22:15:49+00:00,"A customer on Amazon abused a promotional code I gave them and now I've lost ~$50,000 in inventory + other costs. We're in DFW but customer is in Houston, TX.","I sell a line of products on Amazon.com, and recently had an upset customer. To appease them I gave them a promotional code to buy something else from my company for 98% off, but asked them not to share it with anyone else as it could easily be abused, and they agreed. A few days later I find I suddenly have an **enormous** amount of pending orders, at least 70x more than I normally would expect. Amazon starts to send them out and I realize that they're all using that code and I'm actually losing a lot of money on each one. Obviously the earlier customer had shared the code with a large group to get back at us for whatever slight she thought we caused her. I sent a frantic email to Amazon explaining the situation and asking them to cancel the orders but by that point it was too late. It took them almost 24 hours to respond, by which point about 900 of the ~1100 orders had already shipped out; they said they had deactivated the code and canceled the remaining ~200 orders but nothing could be done about those already shipped.

Right now we're basically screwed, it was our flagship product and we not only lost most of our stock (about $46000 retail value), we're out the shipping and Amazon fees (our next settlement date is Monday, and we'll be charged $7.10 for each item sent out), and perhaps most importantly we're not going to have any stock just as the holiday season is starting.

This may very well end our company. When I broke the news to our office today one woman even broke down in tears, she has a permanent illness and might lose her health insurance. All because of one entitled shithead customer. 

What are our options here? I'll be looking into lawyers on Monday but I want to know what to look for. In real costs we're already out at least $50000, conservative estimates are $85000 for lost revenue of what we could have made between now and Jan 1. How do we go after this guy? He even had a few dozen orders shipped to himself.

treksterjay,2016-10-23 20:11:03+00:00,Someone is trying to build a house on my land property,"Hi all, 

So here's the situation. I once lived in Georgia and decided to buy some acres of land there. The land is pretty undeveloped and can be used as hunting grounds. I moved soon after and now live in California so I can't really check up on the land to make sure nothings wrong. It's been a while since I've been to Georgia, so yesterday I asked one of my friends to go check up on my land. 

The friend took pictures of the land and within the photos there were bulldozers and paved trails, which were never there before. It seems as someone is trying to build a house on this land as they carved out a trail that resembles a driveway, with a nice portion of land cleared out (trees cut down and such). 

I understand that there's some kind of law in Georgia which states that if someone builds a house on any type of land, regardless of land ownership, and survives it for 3 years, that house cannot be removed? Fortunately there isn't an actual house build yet, and I'd like to take action before things get more complicated. 

I'm booking a flight to Georgia, and currently looking for lawyers, but I'm a bit unclear on how I should go about this situation. When looking for a lawyer, what should that person be specialized in? What things should I look out for to determine if the lawyer is competent or not? Also I'm thinking of hiring a security firm and installing some security technology such as cameras throughout, but I'm thinking whether I should hire a property management company instead. If anyone would be kind enough to help me out and give me some general advice I would be deeply grateful. Also, if anyone in Georgia is able to provide some referrals - not necessarily only lawyers, but to anyone who could help this situation out - please pm me. 

Thanks for helping this desperate person in advance! 



Edit: Thanks to everyone that gave their input! I'm still open to hearing other peoples' thoughts on this matter. I will ponder more about what next steps to take. After I take action and resolve this matter, I'll give y'all an update on what I did, so the next person dealing with a situation like this can look at this post for reference.

Southdiver,2016-10-21 19:37:19+00:00,How to stop child support?,"5 years ago I had a son born. Me and his mother were not married and we decided to make everything fair we should start child support since neither of us was ready to get married. We kept it civil and got married TO EACH OTHER a year ago. I have just kept paying the CS bc it came straight out of my check. I haven't had a problem paying it since we got married bc she uses it to pay bills and other things. Now, we are looking to get a loan and buy a house.

My question is, how do I stop the child support? We don't have any loans out now and are debt free. I also dont want my child support payment looking like I owe dept to the bank. I owe no back child support either. 

We live in Alabama.

TLDR: We both married each other and the child support is no longer needed as both incomes are shared. How to go about stopping dept of child support?

Edit: Sorry guys and gals I wanted to add that we wrote up a letter explaining the situation to the judge about 6 weeks ago and have not received a response. We was told we would hear from the judge in 2-3 weeks time on his decision.

Edit2: I just want to say that I love you all and how much I really appreciate this community.

The doctors did some pretty extensive blood work on Henry upon his admission to the hospital and the results are in: 

Henry **overdosed** on benadryl.  

So its pretty clear this wasn't an accident. There was no bee sting.The daycare loaded this kid up with benadryl, presumably for nap time, in lethal doses for his age/size and he had a reaction that nearly killed him. 

The daycare is mum right now and not talking. Laura is actively looking for a lawyer.

So long story short:  My father had a lawsuit against him, and after filing bankruptcy the plaintiffs decided to out of nowhere come after my grandmother and I for the money (neither of us had anything to do with this, and I was a minor when everything happened... **twelve years ago**).

So, now with **the update**:

We went in to court nervous as hell, plaintiff was running late but apparently that was normal of him since I the ladies at the desk made a joke about it.  Went and sat down nervous as hell, however my attorney seemed cool as a cucumber so that helped out.  My attorney, the plaintiff's attorney, and the judge all went into the sidebar room and about 10 minutes or so passed, then my attorney came back in to the courtroom with a flat look on his face.  He then let us know that the case had been 100% dropped, there was zero substance to it, and the judge was seemingly pissed for having his time wasted by the plaintiff.  Then he made a joke about how the plaintiff and his attorney were 100% certain they would win this, and instead the plaintiff is walking out with not only no money, but tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands in legal bills of his own.  Karma is a bitch.

Thanks everyone for your advice, I am so glad this is behind me now.

twodumb2live,2016-10-19 13:26:40+00:00,[Update] [Michigan] My Boss IS Doing Something Shady,"I'm not sure if this is allowed or not, but I wanted to give you all fine people of /r/legaladvice an update

I just saw that someone posted here about fifteen days ago that their boss had used their notary stamp and forged their signature.  It reminded me of what happened tome, and I thought I'd share an update, you know... two years late.  My original post can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/2djthd/michigan_my_boss_is_doing_something_shady/).  

So, after the whole notary debacle, I kind of let things stew, but that event was always in the back of my mind.  Shortly after I posted that I ended up quitting, not just for the notary forging, but there were a whole bunch of incidents leading up to it.  I don't want to rehash everything, because I'm trying to put it behind me.  But I will say this, I did end up filing for unemployment and through that process I found out for the entire eight years I was working there she had not ONCE paid her unemployment tax.  Fortunately, I keep really good records, I had ALL of my W2s for the last eight years, and my bank was able to provide me with copies of ALL of the checks I had ever been written to show that taxes were being taken out of my checks and that I wasn't some under-the-table employee.

Unemployment advised that I keep up with calling their system even though I wouldn't be receiving checks because they needed to investigate, which they did.  From what I gather, she just ignored them, and by doing so defaulted on her chance to dispute my claim.  It almost took 4 months before I received a single payment.  And when I did it was all of the disbursements in one lump sum.

It took almost a year before I was ready to enter the work force again, because A.) I was burned out, and B.) I was finishing my Bachelor's.  I'm now working on a Master's in IT and work for an amazing firm which is closer to my house and who pays me way more money.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/58a8yj/update_michigan_my_boss_is_doing_something_shady/,legaladvice,1055,1,
throw_acct_for_this,2016-10-19 02:01:25+00:00,On Friday there was a carbon monoxide leak at my work and we evacuated when the detectors went off. This morning we were all fired for leaving the property without permission,"Throwaway for privacy. On Friday the carbon monoxide detectors at the B&amp;B I work at went off. We didn't have any guests but we were getting ready for some who had reserved for the weekend. Since all the detectors in the building were going off everyone who worked there except for the manager evacuated the building and went to the road across from the property.

The fire department and police came and found there was a leak. The building was closed by the fire department and the guests who had reserved were given refunds and the owner paid for a hotel for them. The manager was taken to the hospital as a precaution because he didn't leave the building until they fire department came. We were not allowed back until this morning.

The owner had a meeting and he fired all 6 of us for leaving the building without permission from the manager. He said the employee policy is clear that no one is allowed to leave the property during work hours without permission from the manager or owner. No exceptions. In our termination letters it says we were fired for leaving without permission against policy but there is nothing about the carbon monoxide in the letter. Was it legal for us to be fired for leaving during an emergency? When we called 911 as we were leaving they told us to leave and get as far away as we could. The manager refused to leave until through fire department forced him and he had to go to the hospital from breathing it in. The owner told us the manager did the right thing. The location is California. I would appreciate any insight for me and my coworkers. Do we have a case for our firings being illegal?

Sublime250,2016-10-18 02:49:57+00:00,UPDATE- 10k in damages to my truck from diesel/gas mix up by gas station,"Original post- https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5157pb/10k_in_damages_to_my_truck_from_dieselgas_mix_up/

Finally got a hold of the transport company- they admitted their driver placed 200 gallons of gasoline in the gas stations underground tank for diesel pumps.

The insurance company paid:
Repairs- $9,950
Rental Vehicle- roughly $1,000
Loss of use- $1,000

The loss of use was difficult to push through, but with documentation of how the smaller vehicle inhibited my work they gave in.

The Dept of agriculture that overlooks gas station fuel quality took my fuel complaint and shut the gas stations diesel pumps down for 6 weeks until they were able to clean the system of contaminates- Actually took two attempts.

What I learned was:

- Always keep fuel receipts

-Use a credit card when fueling (Had to do a chargeback to get my $ back for the cost of the diesel I originally purchased.)

-Only go to reputable fuel stations

-Document, document, document everything.

-Do your homework and aggressively peruse the insurance company for full and fair compensation. I quoted tort law when going after additional loss of use and it got their attention.

So, in the end, things went pretty bad for me, but I got some payback. Last post I mentioned boss was trying to work with me, and got me a temporary work space at another site. Turns out that was because he had just got a big order for some custom parts that I was really the only one qualified to make.

So, about two weeks into fabrication, he calls me at my new site and asks about how long I think the project will take. I say it's about two more weeks. The next day I get a call from him (and his lawyer), and say that the current solution can't be maintained, and ask me to give my notice to resign at the end of the month.

I know I probably should have said no and made them terminate me, but I was so freaking pissed at that point. So I gave them the notice that I was walking out the door, and hung up.

Cue my phone exploding. Calls. Texts. Emails. I ignored them all for the rest of the day. I got a call the next morning, asking why I wasn't at work. Told him I resigned. He tells me I need to finish my project. I hung up.

More calls. One from a coworker I really like. Apparently my boss is freaking out because it's a pretty big fab job for a repeat customer, and there's no one who can take over. They can't even return the raw materials, because I had already used most of them. Apparently, they had to eat the materials as a loss, and the customer cancelled the order. Another friend who works there told me that earlier this month several other people contacted our shop for very similar work, and they all had to be turned away. Guess who got laid off because, between losing the jobs and the materials losses, they couldn't be paid. Yup --- new employee and the dog. I feel a bit bad about that, but just a bit.

I wish I could say things are looking up for me now, but they really aren't. At one point it looked like my boss might bring me back as a contractor for that one job, but when I told him that the rate would be double my previous salary, he decided against it. Haven't had any luck with a new job yet. Things aren't tight yet, but that will only last another 3 or 4 months.

https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/44794y/bc_canada_employer_is_intending_to_hold_back_a/

Amazing advice from everyone in that thread that I definitely took into consideration. 

The situation played out as follows:

I waited to see if I'd been underpaid

I was underpaid

I found a new job (and it's amazing, I wish I'd moved sooner)

I handed in my notice

Partners of the company called me into a meeting to discuss why I was leaving. Lots of panic because I was the lead in my department and things will ""fall apart without you""

Thanked them for their time and said this was non negotiable

Things got nasty with accusations of ""I thought we were family"" (note that I'm not family, I'm totally unrelated to all of them!)

Threats were made to hold back my commissions/bonus as they were 3 months in arrears (ie I got paid them three months after they were submitted)

I referred them to my contract that said they'd be paid no more than 10 days after my leaving date

Toys were thrown by the partners and they threatened to get a lawyer involved.

I used this as an opportunity to say that I'll not talk to them any more without my lawyer present BUT you should know that I'm in possession of an email proving fraud on your part. Gotta go, bye.

Got a series of frantic texts from one of the partners (to be fair, he's a good guy to my knowledge and I don't believe he knew what was going on). Ignored them until the end of the day and replied simply with - ""I'm sorry but I have no comment on this situation until I'm able to get a lawyer to assist me""

Three days later I got a deposit for everything I was owed and the partners thanked me for my service.


On from this I did consider getting them to write a glowing reference for me and get it notarized and I even considered getting them to sign a document saying that they would not make any attempts to bad mouth me in my industry etc but I thought that it was too much bother to follow up on and wanted to walk away from the situation. It's a small industry and they have as much to lose as me with a bad reputation.

Overall it was a success but a really saddening situation. Luckily my new employer is great but it's a real shame it came to this and it's marred my trust in employers somewhat. Maybe this is a good thing though.

Thanks very much to everyone that helped.

Vicky_Vallencourt,2016-09-27 22:31:01+00:00,Old neighbor lady came into my house and shut my AC off when I was away.,"I live in Missouri. 

My boyfriend and I recently purchased a townhouse in a great neighborhood. I'm six months pregnant with a baby girl and we've been preparing for her by renovating. 

Today, we had several workers in our home laying down wood floors. Our neighbor lady has become increasingly nosey and intrusive since we've started construction. Yesterday, she stopped the AC repairman and asked him to convince us to move our unit because she doesn't like where it is. After noticing her talking to my workers all day, stopping them to show them her projects, it finally escalated into the workers telling me that she came into my house and shut my thermostat off herself (because the noise was bothering her). 

I got pretty angry and called my boyfriend parents to come over. As soon as we went outside to chat, the neighbor came barging over acting really hostile about me running my air conditioning. I asked her not to come into my property ever again and that anything concerning my home is none of her business. 

We went to lunch shortly after and I returned home to a hot house, I turned my AC back on. I guess she didn't like that because as soon as the workers left, she came banging on my front door and even jiggled the door handle. When I didn't open the front door after alot of police- like loud banging, she opened my fence and banged on the back door for a solid five minutes. 

I feel like I can't go sit out on my back porch because she wants to confront me about something she doesn't like about the home I own. She's an older lady that lives by herself and she seems pretty mentally unstable. I am home alone constantly and being pregnant doesn't help with the added stress. What else can I do to stop this madness? Do I call the police? 

Tl;dr: Old neighbor lady came keeps harassing me about the placement of my ac unit and entered my home without permission when I was away.

One of them is being driven by the dealership employee and the other two by his relatives,"This is about my grandfather. He is 80 years old and he is in a retirement home. I found papers in his house for financing for cars and loans. I have just gotten POA for his financial matters. When I spoke to the bank and looked into it they thought my grandfather had purchased 3 new cars last year. I thought there had been a mistake because my grandfather hasn't been able to drive for years.

I went to the police station on the advice of the bank employee. They did some investing and found out that the dealership employee who sold the cars to him is driving one of them, and his brother and cousin are driving the others. The cars, financing and insurance all have my grandfather's name on it. They were arrested.

My grandfather is in the beginning stages of dementia and he doesn't know these people. Is he still responsible for the loans? What do I tell the bank? Sorry if these questions are obvious, I've had to deal with anything like this before.

school_legal_,2016-09-21 01:15:34+00:00,(Florida) A boy hit my step daughter in the face with a skateboard and broke her cheek. She wasn't even the target and has been suspended for 2 weeks for fighting,"My step daughter is in her junior year of high school. She was walking down the hall and turned a corner and was hit in the face by a skateboard by a freshman boy she had never met. It was witnessed by 3 teachers and 3 students who all said she was just walking and they never spoke before it happened. The boy who did it told the teachers who saw that he was wanted to hit the boy walking behind my step daughter and not her because he doesn't ""even know that bitch"". After he hit her he got in a fist fight with the boy who had been walking behind her and the police had to be called.

My step daughter was unconscious and an ambulance was called. She has a broken cheek and had to spend the night in the hospital. Both her and the boy who hit her have been suspended from school for 2 weeks (10 days) for fighting. The principal won't take mine or my husband's calls and neither will the superintendent. We are frustrated beyond belief. The boy who hit her was arrested for assaulting my step daughter, for assaulting a teacher, for a assaulting a police officer and for having marijuana in his pocket. He was suspended for 10 days like my step daughter. 

The boy who was the target who was fought with him after was not suspended or arrested because he was ""defending"" himself. I can't believe how ridiculous this is because my step daughter was not fighting she was attacked, as per the teachers and the student witnesses. My step daughter was also told that she cannot come to school if she is prescribed pain medication and takes it because they don't allow students to attend school if they are using drugs. The police also believe was attacked and are not charging her. Her suspension means she is ineligible for all extra curricular activities and the honor roll for the rest of the school year. My step daughter has always been on the honor roll, and without this and the extra curricular activity she will be hampered if not lose her chance for a scholarship after she graduates next year. Is there anything we can do under Florida law to get this reversed or is there some kind of action we can take against the school? It is a public high school in Florida.

chuckleen,2016-09-18 23:43:49+00:00,Woman wrestled me to the ground and held me at gunpoint (Florida),"Hello everyone, I hope this is the right subreddit to post this.  I'm a bit shaken by the entire experience.  This happened about 2 weeks ago.  

I am a 25 year old male.  I am also black in a primarily white neighborhood, which may or may not be relevant but I'll mention it anyway. 

I live in an apartment complex with my dad and stepmom, and we have an assigned parking spot. My stepmom's car stays there, and my dad and I park our cars on the street.  

It was a Saturday evening around 9:00.  My stepmom realized she left something in her car so she told me to get it.  I grabbed her keys and went downstairs to the parking lot.  This is where I messed up.  She drives a different model car than me, and so I got confused with how to unlock the door and I guess I must have accidentally pressed the car alarm.  I was frantically pushing buttons trying to get the alarm to stop. 

This lady (white, probably age 50s) came over and grabbed my arm and wrestled me to the ground.  Another lady (also white, probably 40s) was passing by and asked ""what's going on"".  The first lady replied ""car thief!"" The second lady took out her gun and pointed it at my head while I was still pinned down to the ground.  The police showed up in a few minutes, I'm not sure who called them.  Maybe the second lady did, but I was too scared to notice.  

The police talked to the ladies and then to me.  They wanted me to verify that the car was mine.  I opened the glove box and got the registration, but it was in my stepmom's name and she has a different last name than me.  So they decided to arrest me because I couldn't prove that I had permission to open the car.  I told them to go and check with my stepmom, but they refused.  Thankfully, just as they were handcuffing me, my dad came out to see why I was taking so long.  The police told him that they needed proof that I had permission, so my dad went inside and got my stepmom, and she showed her ID and registration to the police, and they un-handcuffed me and let me go.

So I don't think I am facing any charges anymore, but this was a traumatic experience and I have several bruises and a bump on my head from when the lady knocked me to the ground.  I was pretty sure the second lady was going to shoot me so I closed my eyes, prayed and waited.  I just want to know if there is anything I can do legally to these two ladies for what they put me through. Also, did the police act appropriately in this case, and if not can I complain to anyone.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/53eudy/woman_wrestled_me_to_the_ground_and_held_me_at/,legaladvice,1492,153,

worriedmother69775,2016-09-15 19:18:57+00:00,My landlord moved someone in while I was away!,"I'm in New Jersey. I and my daughter were away to visit my mother the last week of August, I had told my landlord we were leaving on a short vacation as is stipulated on my lease. I live in a two bedroom apartment, where the second room was for my daughter. Well, when I got back, I found out my landlord moved his brother into my kid's bedroom, and all my things in there were either thrown out or basically given to his brother to sell. My daughter now has to sleep with me.

I contested this, showing him that my lease was only for two occupants: me and my kid. He told me to ""go **** myself"" and if I couldn't handle living with a roommate to move out though I would have to buy out my lease, I had just renewed it in June so I would owe nine months of rent to him which I can't afford. 

My new ""roommate"" is a deadbeat asshole. He hogs the bathroom, drops stuff on the floor and won't pick them up, hangs his clothes all over, brings home strange women to have loud sex with, does drugs right in front of my daughter...and this is all in the span of less than two weeks. I don't think we can live here for another nine months...but like I said, I can't afford it! Can I legally throw him out? Can I take my landlord to court, and sue him? 

On another note, when moving his brother in, my landlord also apparently sold our pet cat and flushed my daughter's fish down the toilet, so he and his brother claim. Can I also sue them for this, though I have no evidence of this other than their word and the fact the pets are gone.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/52xur3/my_landlord_moved_someone_in_while_i_was_away/,legaladvice,1162,301,

The reason they want to evict her is because if any new occupants are going to live in your house, including babies and children, you must ask the HOA in writing and receive written permission BEFORE they move in. The cops or CPS (I don't remember which) brought the boys to her house in the middle of the night and she didn't ask the HOA for permission until 9 days later because she was arranging the funeral and dealing with the legality of being their guardian.

Some of you may remember my post from a few months back.  Thanks to everyone who provided some great legal advice and otherwise good life advice.  More than anything, it has made us extremely grateful for our our sound mental health.  I want to reiterate that everything in these posts is 100% true, this is not viral marketing or a made up story for internet points - it has been nothing short of a nightmare that we wouldn't wish on anyone.

A few things have happened since the post.  We switched ISPs to a company that allegedly makes her sicker than our old one did.  No idea of the logic behind this, because like all of her claims, there is nothing backing it up.  We also installed solar panels that require an additional meter on the house.  Before the new meter was installed, we called to check the delivery date and were informed that they had a work order to install an analog meter instead of the usual digital type that is readable from the street.  We can't prove it, but we suspect she called on our behalf and tried to request the change.  She harassed the installers, the building inspector, National Grid workers, and anyone she could complain to and generally made the installation process even more painful for everyone involved.  Even before the meter was turned on and the panels were generating energy, she went berserk and claimed her symptoms were worsening.

She cited a bylaw in our HOA that essentially states that residents cannot engage in activities that adversely affect the health of others.  She used this to try to petition the board to evict us from our home (which we own).  When that got her nowhere, she tried to petition them to build a 30 foot concrete wall between our property and hers at the expense of the HOA (yes, you read that right, she wanted to build a wall and make the HOA pay for it).  After that, she tried to get the board to tell us that we needed to wrap our water and electric meters with ""multiple layers of tin foil"" (no word on whether the gas meter makes her sick, also).  Thankfully, the board is comprised of sane people, and after consulting an attorney who specializes in disabilities/ADA claims, they told her that the HOA has no jurisdiction in this matter.  I've read HOA horror stories on this sub, but this is one case where an HOA was very helpful.  The board members reiterated that if her health problems are really that bad, she should move. 

After exhausting all the utilities, public utility commission, contractors, the building inspector, and our HOA, this seems to be the end of the line for her.  She noted her intentions to sell her home  in her response to the board. Rumor has it that she is also feuding with the neighbors on her other side about the types of dryer sheets they use.

In hopes of sealing the deal, we consulted with an attorney to write a a cease and desist letter or something that would let her know we are serious about standing our ground.  We were hoping it would be on letterhead and explain the legal standing we hold, but instead, [this](http://imgur.com/a/uY9VT) is the piece of crap we got in return.  Seriously, we paid $100 for that letter from a *licensed attorney*.  A 2nd grader could do better.  We are obviously not sending it, and hope that the move is quick and painless.

He didn't tell me to stop calling, so I just kept at it. Every email meant a phone call, and he kept hanging up after hearing the first few words.

It took over a dozen calls but he eventually listened and we talked for a bit. I think reading out his SSN had something to do with it, but hearing what I could do with his accounts was the real kicker to the deal.

He agreed he couldn't keep using my email address, and I offered to set one up for him. Our names are close and I own a lot of variations on my name, so first@middle.last.com, first@middlelast.com and first@last.com are now his, and they all forward to each other.

ExpiresAfterUse,2016-08-29 15:38:37+00:00,Can I have a girl sign a contract that either forces her to get an abortion or gets me off the hook for child support?,"No. You cannot.

We get multiple questions a week with guys asking if they can write up an enforceable contract that forces the woman they slept with to get an abortion if she gets pregnant. In addition, many of these people also want to know if they can have her sign a contract making it impossible for her to collect child support.

If you don't want to worry about unintended pregnancy, don't have sex. If you are going to be an adult and have a sexual relationship, you also need to be an adult and understand that children can result from your actions.

EDIT: Here is a short excerpt from a user below as to way this is not possible, as written by a Wisconsin state judge. Find the whole thing [here](http://www.whdlaw.com/Publications/Dodd_WisconsinJournalOfFamilyLaw_5-12.pdf).

&gt;In sum, the judge found that family matters are matters of public interest, and the consequences of family contracts (and the court’s decisions regarding them) are more significant to society than those of other contracts.
Accordingly, the public interest must always be taken into account because the impairment or breach of family responsibilities generally results in injury to the public wholly apart from the effect upon the parties immediately concerned.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/505lpy/can_i_have_a_girl_sign_a_contract_that_either/,legaladvice,3269,662,

Firstly I would like to thank everyone for all the support in my first post and all the supportive PM's I received. It was really overwhelming (in a good way). A few people asked for an update so here it is.

So a lot has happened since I first posted. I called in to work while I was trying to get all this sorted. One of my co-workers has a cousin who is a lawyer and she knew someone who was able to help me and file the paperwork. My husband played dumb in court but his visits got reduced to supervised and he was ordered to take a parenting class. My daughter went to physiotherapy. Eventually the court reinstated his visitation when he swore he had learned his lesson and was sorry and with his otherwise clean record the court agreed. I was against it but the court ruled against me.

I gave my daughter her own cell phone so she could call me whenever she needed to. On her second visit it happened again. This time the brace had steel and fabric instead of wood and they took her phone too. The next night she left when they weren't looking and went up the street to a neighbor who is a police officer. The neighbor called paramedics and her co-workers. They had to cut the brace off my daughter. My husband and his wife were arrested. They got out quickly but they have been charged and their infant is with CPS. My ex lost visitation and custody and I'm working on making it permanent. Unfortunately my daughter's shoulder was dislocated from the brace. It set back her rehab and part of her arm is still numb and tingling. She needed surgery and is still recovering. She always played sports (especially at school) and did dance but the doctor thinks she won't ever be able to lift her arm all the way up again. I hate my ex and he'll see her again over my fucking dead body. Right now I'm focusing on my daughter while my lawyer takes care of things. That's my update.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/4xbb4q/update_my_ex_husband_and_his_new_wife_made_my/,legaladvice,6203,1,

Our cat was locked in the upstairs bathroom and defecated all over the place and the dogs did too.  We looked at our security camera footage and found out that the pet sitter decided to have a fucking pool party at our house and invited dozens of people over to use our facilities and ate our food.  What would I do in this situation?  We already called the company and complained and had her fired, but what else can we do for justice of this horrible act if possible?  I feel like we're at a loss and can't do much other than get her fired.


EDIT: Thanks for all the responses, everyone.  We're in the process of trying to hold the company responsible for paying all of the vet bills and cleaning.  The food cost is negligible, so we won't pursue that.  So far, nothing was damaged, but it will take a bit of time to see if they stole anything.

EDIT 2: Alright due to a lot of concern, we're going ahead and adding the cost of food.  So far, the damages and pet bills are under $8,000 so we will be going to a small claims court.

(Virgina)","I have a question about if the following is legal to put in a dress code for a company that does office based work (so no safety concerns because it's not a warehouse or factory):

**No employee shall be permitted to have any prosthetic limbs visible. Said employee's must wear closed shoes and pants with a wide leg so as not to render a prosthetic limb or its outline visible (no skirts are permitted). In the case of a prosthetic arm or hand, employees shall ensure that their sleeves are long enough and wide enough so as not to show the prosthesis or its outline. Any visible prosthetic or outline will be condsidered as unprofessional dress and will result in dicipline up to and including dismissal, without a warning being required.**

Someone has worked there for 18 months and wears skirts every day. She has a prosthetic leg. The new company president authroized this addition to the dress code and the board is aware. Would it be legal for the company to fire her if she wore a skirt tomorrow and her prosthetic leg was showing? This occurred in the state of Virginia.

aaronincali,2016-08-09 00:02:24+00:00,Found not guilty of rape but I am being punished anyway (California),"I am a bit upset and frustrated right now so sorry if this is incoherent.  

I attend a public school in California.  I will be starting my senior year next month.  

I started dating a girl, let's call her Jane, two years ago.  We broke up in June of this year.  

After we broke up, Jane reported to the university that I raped her on multiple occasions from November 2015 to June 2016.  

Her story was rather ridiculous because she kept dating me after I supposedly raped her.  I also had text messages showing that everything was consensual.  She kept changing the dates that she claimed I raped her.

The dean's office held several hearings which I had to go to.  It was very stressful.

Just last week, I got a letter saying I was found not guilty.  So I thought everything was good.

But then, 2 days later, I got another letter saying that for her protection and to avoid further problems, I will have to follow some regulations for next year.  

1.  I am not allowed to enroll in any class that she is taking.  If she chooses to enroll in a class that I am in, I have to drop it.
2.  I am not allowed to live on campus, and I have to forfeit my security deposit for the dorms. 
3.  I am not allowed to date any student at the university without first informing the dean's office. 
4.  I must give the police department 24 hours notice before entering any campus building other than for regular class, so they can make sure she isn't there at the same time.  

I am fine with 1, 2, and 3.  She is not in my major so she won't be taking the same classes anyway.  And I don't really care about the $750 deposit for the dorms.  But number 4 seems rather draconian.  I can't even go to the library to study without giving 24 hours notice.  I can't get food from the student union unless I give notice.  

Is there anything I can do about this legally, especially considering the fact that I was found not guilty of doing anything.  The notice says that your privilege to attend classes on campus for the coming academic year is contingent on your acceptance of these terms.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/4wtbz0/found_not_guilty_of_rape_but_i_am_being_punished/,legaladvice,1020,224,

Luckily for me, the judge dismissed the prosecutor's case with prejudice due to lack of evidence and the fact that a key witness is apparently unavailable. 

Since then, the police have kind of been harassing me. In the past month, I've been pulled over a total of 9 times, each time without getting a ticket. My neighbor told me that he saw someone rifling through my garbage on garbage day. In addition, there has been a marked police car parked outside of my house, I guess to intimidate me or whatever.

I've been keeping my nose clean and focusing on running my business. I'm not sure why the police feel the need to continuously harass me for nothing.  It is causing me a lot of mental anguish and stress.

Couriousgoat,2016-08-05 16:17:11+00:00,Sold a gold bracelet and got a call from the jeweler saying they want their money back.,"So I sold a gold bracelet for around $400.00 at a gold/silver dealer, the person there tested it several times and determined it was made of 18k gold, it was my great aunts and part of a bunch of jewelry she left me in her will. 

Dealer payed accordingly in the form of a check. Fast forward a couple of days and I get a phone call from the place telling me that I need to come in ASAP to give them the money back because when they went to melt said bracelet they determined it wasn't all gold and that they can only give me $60.00 for the bracelet. I already spent the money in a present for my boyfriend, whole reason I even sold it on the first place.

 Can they do that? They checked to make sure the bracelet was made of gold, they did it several times. What can I do? Can they just demand for their money and pay me a joke ($60.00)? I'm in texas greater Houston area, I'm 21 yrs old. 

Thank you for your help.

Edit:  got a call from them again, didn't answer let it go to voicemail.

They said that they could offer **upto $110.00** for the bracelet because of the plated gold it has(which sounds ridiculous because plating is usually only microns thick.) and I only had to return the rest. I'm thinking if they call again I'm saying what user /u/beholdmycape said and if they keep at it what user /u/danweber said.

Edit 2: they called again and I answered, Lady on the phone was nice enough and explained that she got what was left of the bracelet in pieces as they were getting it ready for melting and that some has already been melted. She stated that they are offering me 110 for the gold it had plated, I told her it was ridiculous to offer almost 2 grams worth of gold for the amount of gold in something that is ""gold plated"". 

I told her that they themselves tested it several times, determined it's worth, offered what they thought was fair, and we both agreed on the transaction, that I cannot be held liable for anything they do with the bracelet after, Furthermore that since they can't return my bracelet in the same condition as it was sold, it would be akin to trying to return broken merchandise to a store. Said thank you and goodbye she then said she'd talk to the owner and call.

Another tenant told me that they had notified our landlord of this problem in the past, and he said he had changed all of the locks: however, this is either not true or he gave everyone the master key. Regardless, I am able to access any door in the apartment that isn't chained and anyone would be able to walk into my apartment if it wasn't chained. 
My landlord also has not given us a fire detector. We notified him our stove was broken on the 18th of last month and he has yet to send anyone out to fix it.
What do we do? Currently 2 months into a year long lease. 

Update 1: Reached out to landlord. He said he hadn't been notified of the lock problem (I know he had). He said he was fixing it today. Got it in writing that he is fixing it TODAY. Calling the fire department after I get off work about the smoke detector problem. He said he ""put in an order"" to ""his guy"" to get our oven fixed and was like ""oh it hasn't been fixed?"" No. It hasn't dude. 
Update 2: It wasn't fixed yesterday. He said he's getting it done today and is blaming the delay on his maintenance guy. I had to go to work but my friend is staying at her apartment to see what happens with this. We want to see a new lock go in these god damn doors. If it isn't fixed by tomorrow I'm doing it myself.

The cashier was suspicious of an elderly woman purchasing so many and called the police. The cashier was fired the next day for costing her workplace a purchase.,"My location is Florida. Apologies if this is an obvious question, I am not familiar with the law in any way and have no idea about the legality of this.

My 70 year old great aunt got a call from the ""IRS"" saying she owed them money or she would be arrested. They said she had to pay them in gift cards ASAP. Of course this is a well known scam but my great aunt believed it (we've since told her about how these scams work and she knows now to call one of her kids if she gets a call asking for money or personal information). My great aunt went out and tried to purchase hundreds of dollars in iTunes gift cards. The cashier got suspicious of an elderly woman buying so many for so much, especially after my great aunt couldn't tell her what iTunes was. The cashier knew what was going on and called the police and got my great aunt to call a family member. My great aunt did not buy any gift cards or lose any money.

The next day my cousin went to thank the cashier but she was not in and the manager told my cousin she had quit. Another employee approached my cousin in the parking lot and said the cashier was actually fired. My cousin left his number with the employee and the cashier later called him. She was terminated the day after she helped my great aunt. The reasons in her termination letter (which I have seen) were ""acting outside her authority as an employee"" and ""actions causing /company's name/ to lose a transaction or purchase"" due to an incident on /date she helped my aunt/. Her manager verbally told her it was for ""stopping that old lady from spending $700""

My family is angry on her behalf. She's only in her early 20s and is working full time to help her family while going to college part time at night. She was denied unemployment because she was fired for cause. My family would help her but we are not well off by any stretch. Was it even legal for her company to fire her for helping save a person from being scammed? Does she have any means to contest this?

Please help me, I am in Nevada.  I literally just got done talking with my hysterical neighbor who just got back from Hawaii.   When the family got home, they found their 2 dogs dead inside of the garage.  They have been locked inside the garage for 11 days with no food or water since the people left for vacation.  They are blaming me for the deaths, but I was not the designated care taker.  

Maybe 2  weeks before they left, the dad had asked me if I would be interested in watching the dogs, but also said that they might stay with a relative or maybe with a coworker, but I said to let me know if they needed me and I'd be happy to do it.  That was the last time I ever talked to them about it, like they never gave me a key, or feeding instructions, or any confirmation that they did need me to watch the dogs.  they never mentioned watching the dogs except for that one time.  I assumed the dogs were staying with the coworker or the relative because it was never mentioned again. Tonight, the dad told me the side door to the garage was unlocked and the food was in the garage.  I have never walked into their house without knocking, let alone went into their house while no one was home.  I have no idea why he would assume I knew the side door was unlocked, or that I would know where the dog food was or how much/often the dogs eat.  I told him these things and he said he assumed I knew how to feed the dogs because ""we have been neighbors for so long"".  I have never once seen them feed their dogs. 

He is told me he is going to call the police and hold me responsible for the deaths.  My wife was able to see that he was able to announce on his Facebook that we murdered his dogs before he deleted us.  I don't think my wife or I have done anything wrong, but is there any advice anyone can give?  I wouldn't be suprised if they honestly just forgot about the dogs and are now trying to blame us.

Well some stuff happened. 

I brought a copy of my RO to my job and pulled my boss aside and told him I really, actually couldn't call Mrs. Grey. He said ""well if you can't do your job then you're fucking fired"". He was looking for an excuse to fire me for a while and I guess that was it. I had a little bit of savings but I was still really worried and had to look for a new job. I just found one and it's a terrible physical labor kind of job but at least i'm not homeless i guess.

I got a visit from the police. They asked me some questions and I told them I wouldn't answer without a lawyer. That seemed to make them pretty mad and they took me to jail. It was humiliating. They charged me with vialating my RO and I had to pay bail to get out. 

I pawned some stuff to pay for a lawyer. We actually had a really hard time getting the bank to cooperate and help us get evidence. i think my old boss was still trying to screw me over. so that fucking sucked. But eventually we went to trial and my lawyer did a really good job of proving that I had no way of knowing it was her. i got off but still have to pay for all the legal bills.

Before we went to trial I had an anger management relapse (i don't know what else to call it) and punched the shit out of my wall because of the stress so my wrist was sprained for a few weeks and I thought it was broken but it got better on its own so at least i don't have medical bills. this is why i don't feel like it's safe to have a relationship again yet. so i'm glad i chose to be single but i also feel awful that i'm still such a shitheel after all the work i've done. i've been too optimistic about my progress in anger management. so that sucks.

Also some people have been throwing rocks at my house and I think that's probably related to this whole situation.

All in all the whole experience was terrible and nerveracking and I don't ever want it to happen again so once I pay off my new legal debt I'm going to save up to move somewhere far away where I don't have to worry about accidentally running into Ms. Brown/Mrs. Grey.

Thank you so much to everyone who commented and PMd me on the last thread. You have no idea how much your support meant to me and how much it lifted my spirits. 

I'm so pleased to be able to update you that **Petal and James are safely back home with us!!**

We followed everyone's advice and called up the shelter she works at and advised them of the whole situation. We told them about how her credentials as a rescuer/foster carer were originally what made us feel comfortable about using her services, that she had taken the cats and was alleging abuse, that she had failed to take Petal's eyedrops, our concerns re animal hoarding etc. and we advised them that we would be pursuing her with the police and a private lawyer.

I say ""we"", but it was really my amazing husband who made the call while I was stuck at work.

That same day, I had an awkward moment where both myself and her mother were alone together in our office kitchen so I decided to just be really forthright with her and said, ""I think you should know that [husband] and I have contacted the shelter [daughter] works for, and we've also filed theft reports with the police and have taken on a lawyer. We're also notifying animal control about the number of pets she has. It's not too late for her to stop this."" (we actually hadn't gone to the station or called a lawyer yet, but I thought it might sound more serious). 

I don't know if it was her mom or the shelter that called her and told her to do the right thing, but my son called me at work just two hours later telling me that the daughter's boyfriend had just dropped Petal and James back home. My son said the boyfriend didn't say much and he didn't seem to know much about the drama, he just left the cats in my son's care and left.

I left work immediately and came home to my babies (oh, and my son lol). 

Both were well and safe, and we saw the vet that evening and had some tests done that we're still awaiting the results for - but all in all they seem fine. Petal's eyes were fine, and the vet said its possible she had access to the drops through the shelter, so that's a small mercy.

We still haven't decided if we're going to take it further legally. We have reported her to animal control regarding her pet numbers, but her instagram and facebook have gone into privacy lockdown so I don't know if she's still keeping the hero/victim narrative going or if there have been any consequences with the shelter. 

Again, thank you so much to everyone and I hope you can all rest a little easily (like I can) knowing that James and Petal are where they belong back home with us. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/4strc8/update_cat_sitter_stole_our_cats_petal_and_james/,legaladvice,3278,2,
helpcatnapped,2016-07-12 06:35:04+00:00,Help! Our cat sitter is refusing to give us our cats back and is making false neglect allegations!,"New York, USA.

I'll try to be brief and try not to ramble, but I'm feeling really upset right now.

My husband and I recently had to travel to Italy for a week at short notice due to a death in his family. We have two cats, a two year old female British Shorthair and a six year old male moggy, and didn't have time to organise a boarding stay so a co-worker referred me to her 22yo daughter who pet sits and house sits on occasion. She works with a rescue organisation, so we felt comfortable with her pet sitting even though we'd only met her a handful of times. She always seemed nice and had, in the past expressed delight at seeing pictures of our cat (particularly our BSH) and the immediacy of our travel arrangements didn't give us a lot of options.

While we were away we heard from her every second day and her updates seemed fine and happy, and she included pics here and there of the cats and they seemed reasonably content. We left heaps of food and litter, and a little instruction list as our BSH has daily eyedrops. 

When we arrived home from the airport, our house was all locked up and she and the cats were nowhere to be found. 

I called her, and she told me that when she arrived in the evening there was no food or water left for the cats and she had taken them because she felt we had ""clearly neglected them"" and that she wouldn't be ""releasing them back into your care"" (her words). I told her that was not at all the case, and asked why had she not mentioned any of this in our communication. She hung up on me and has not since answered any of my calls or returned any texts.

This is completely insane. We fed our cats wet food in the morning, and left them with two bowls of biscuits and two water bowls. And our cats are obviously not neglected. They're both happy and healthy, and had an annual vet visit a month before hand and both were given a clean bill of health and vaccination boosters. 

Anyone who knows me knows I love my cats and take the best care of them. My co-workers joke that I am a crazy cat lady because I am such an attentive owner.

We found out that while we were away, she had been posting on her Facebook and Instagram accounts about ""saving"" two neglected cats from a ""bad home"". The only ""evidence"" she posted of the neglect was a picture of an empty water bowl that wasn't even ours or taken in our home! There were all sorts of comments telling her what a hero she was, and when one person commented on a picture of our cats that they didn't look neglected she became really aggressive towards the person and said ""it looks worse in person"" (which it doesn't). I think she's crazy and she just wants our cats, or wants to be seen as a hero or something.

I called the police station, and they didn't want to know about it and told me it's a civil property dispute. 

It's been six days, and I am absolutely heartbroken. Her mother, my co-worker, is siding with her daughter and has been bad mouthing me at work and is refusing to talk to me. I have no idea what to do. 

All of the cats microchip details are in my name, and I have called all the local vet clinics advising them that my cats have been stolen and they will call me if they come in. 

I have amassed a collection of photographs, and the vets health assessment as evidence that the cats are not at all neglected - but I just don't know what to do. 

Please help me.

We've printed off all of her Facebook and Instagram posts regarding our cats, and we also have all the communications from when we organised the catsitting through to the happy, positive messages she sent us while we were away as some of them were sent to us at the same time as she was posting her neglect stories on Facebook. I really hope to be able to provide you with a happy ending update soon!

Bandthrowaway9282,2016-07-10 22:33:06+00:00,(Florida) A former students mother wants to sue for emotional damages after they saw me perform with my band.,"I'm a high school biology teacher, on the weekends and during summer I'm the lead singer of a band(synth and gothic rock).

Last night we were performing at a local restaurant/bar. It was packed and I didn't even see my former student there. He's 17 or 18 and graduated in May, his mother was supposedly with him.

This morning I got a call from the mother say how she and her son saw me on stage and were ""deeply disturbed to see someone that he admired and respected acting like a rebellious teenager"" and that ""her son has had issues since then"". She's threatening to sue me for emotional damages and to ""spread the word that I'm not normal"".

My husbands also in the band(guitarist) and he's also a teacher at the same school, the student was in his classes but she's focused on me.

Would the union be able to help? It's clearly not a school issue. Can she actually sue me for emotional damages because her son saw a band playing?",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/4s7rkl/florida_a_former_students_mother_wants_to_sue_for/,legaladvice,1134,293,

She died in Oregon State a few hours ago. I live in Seattle, WA. Could someone please tell me what I am supposed to do now? I know I need to arrange for her body to be moved somehow, maybe?

Should I call her bank? her landlord? I am going to call the medical examiner in the morning but that's literally the only thing the police told me to do. I found some checklists online but they are mostly aimed at much older people and are useless.

She doesn't have a will. She is unmarried. She has a bunch of stuff in a rented apartment, owns a car outright (that I gave to her - maybe that could help with the title?) and likely has a few small debts. Her lease is up in two months. 

What am I supposed to do now? More importantly, what shouldn't I do?

You have no idea how much I appreciate all of the help and support. Seriously, you guys did an amazing thing. Thank you again so so much.

CptSirDuke,2016-06-25 16:28:57+00:00,Tldr; campus leasing office stole my bike along with a hundred others to be sold for their profit. They claim it's their legal right to do this on their premises. Is this actually legal?,"I'm a university student in Texas and I live in on-campus housing. Recently I came home from the airport to discover my bike was gone. With a little investigation i found my leasing office had gone around campus cutting free bikes to be sold for their own benefit. Now this is especially weird, because my bike is registered with my leasing office and is clearly marked with a neon tag.

It wasn't until I threatened the office with involving the police (treating this as an act of theft) that I got my bike back, and the bike still had it's registration tags on it. I demanded reimbursement for the $80 lock they cut and for inconvenience of them stealing my registered bike to be pawned, but they said they were %100 in their rights to cut any locks and take any bikes since they're on their premises. 

Can they do this? I mean is it legal? Should I do something about it? I'm going to the campus attorney to talk about it sometime in the next week, but I'm curious until then.

Edit; bike was stored in the proper bike racks in the proper way.

Edit: a few have mentioned the attorney will be of no help against the school, but the on campus housing is operated by a private company contractor. That and the attorney's page from my school's website explicitly says they can help with disputes with the on campus leasing office. So yeah.

Edit: (ripped from one of my comments) They sent an email saying they would mark damaged, abandoned, or improperly stored bikes a week ahead of time with red signs to be removed. I don't know if they actually did that, because my bike was never marked with any signs but it was still removed.

Wow another edit: some of you think I'm overreacting with this, and you're probably right. But I'm not from a rich family, and that bike was premium. Probably one of the most expensive gifts from my parents I've ever gotten. And the only reason they got it for me was because I'm going to college for free and not costing them thousands of dollars. 

One last edit: when I say home, I mean my apartment on campus. It's where I live, and that's where I currently am this summer and for the foreseeable future until I can get the hell out of here.

CheeseGraterFairy,2016-06-24 19:09:16+00:00,"[UPDATE] Woman boarding my dog, keeps adding charges, and we are at a stalemate on signing a contract.","So much has happened in the last few days, and it has completely restored my faith in humanity.

So many kind people reached out to me after seeing my post, I can't even begin to express my gratitude. I came here for some IANAL legal advice but ended up with /u/subjectivenorm orchestrating a puppy rescue in the nick of time.

The last two weeks have been a constant battle between the woman who had my dog and me. Every time I heard the email notification go off on my phone, my stress level jumped. Within 24 hours, Reddit and the FB group North American Siberian Husky changed that.

My Husky is currently safe and happy, surrounded by people that truly care about his happiness. 

Without the support of people like you, Reddit, I don't know what I would have done. 

/u/Xiac and /u/subjectivenorm offered to open their home to a dog that had been labeled aggressive by his last boarder. Both of you were willing to expose your family and yourselves and I will never be able to repay your kindness. 

Subjectivenorm and her famIly currently have my dog. They have  gone above and beyond anything I could have hoped for. Their kindness has brought me to tears. If more people were like them, I would be out of a job.

TL;DR Reddit saved my dog from a horrible situation, and I will forever be thankful.

holyshitwatdo21,2016-06-16 06:18:06+00:00,Update - Tx - My friends drugged me and are going to jail. Final update to the shroomburger fiasco.,"This is the final update to the whole fiasco. 

First.  I got a lot of heat from people saying that I was trolling or that the timeline of events were not lining up. Yes 12-16 hours is a really quick time period for everything to happen. If you do not know all of the facts. And none of you knew all of the facts because there was a significant portion of details I was leaving out for various reasons. The most of which to protect me. 

In fact you may be surprised to learn that the first arrest happened only three hours after speaking to the police. The guy who was arrested first had priors and one of the officers I spoke with knew this guy by name. He knew where he lived and has dealt with him before. Now granted this police dept only has about 15-20 officers and that is me estimating no clue on the actual number. Small town of only about 5-8k people. 

The parents of this kid were tired of dealing with him. They had gotten him out of trouble before and this appeared to be the final straw for them. They not only let them enter their house, they encouraged them to search his room. (This I found out later through facebook.) This kid was 20 years old and had to be bailed out by his parents, both literally and figuratively, many times before. Once for selling weed while in high school on high school grounds, once for having cigarrets on middle school grounds, and once for a fight in high school. After high school he got a petty theft charge for trying to steal a 20 dollar game from walmart in his pants. Simply put he was a punk and he only got worse as he got older. 

Also I am not in Dallas. I am in a small town near dallas but the drugging happened in another town where I grew up. I only mentioned Dallas because most of you have never heard of this place and Dallas is only 10-15min away. Usually this is par for the course for small suburbs near Dallas.  

That is all of the details I am willing to share here about that.  

Second. It looks like none of the people are going to be charged with what happened to me. If they were to charge them with anything related to that, it would be assault and battery most likely. I was told that it was too hard to prove guilt in this situation as it is too hard to prove who actually put it there vs who knew it was on the burger.  

The text messages, voicemail, and video only show what happened after the fact. It does not prove who put it there. If they were not all facing possession with intent charges then it would be completely possible to eventually get the truth. But since the possession with intent is basically a slam dunk here and everyone is willing to take plea deals the court is declining to prosecute on that one. As far as I know, outside of the girlfriend, none of them have taken any deals yet but they are all pretty much in a no win situation so plea deals are likely to be given.

I am not too happy about that but I have learned quickly that I must pick my battles carefully. Thankfully all of them, excluding the girlfriend of the guy who hosted the party, have felony charges pending. She has no priors and was busted with a small amount of weed. Only enough for a minor felony. But since it was her first offense they dropped it down to misdemeanor possession. She got probation and a hefty fine.  Again not happy about it but I can live with it. She can skate off to whichever loser she finds next. 

Misdemeanor possession is enough to effectively shut off her ability to make money legitimately for a while anyways. 

Third. There were some lingering effects of what happened but it looks like they are going away. I spoke with my doctor the Monday after what happened to me and he told me to immediately tell him if I start having mild hallucinations. I have been seeing things out of the corner of my eye, and seeing people who are not there making me do double takes. As well as some minor things like colors shifting on me or rooms appearing much brighter than they should be. My Doctor does not believe it do be HPPD thankfully as the symptoms are all wrong. He did tell me that hallucenogens do sometimes linger in the fat and can be released as it metabolizes. The symptoms are mild and appear to be going away so I am inclined to agree with my doctor on this. We are keeping a close watch but it looks like I am good here. 

And finally. Everyone eventually found out that it was me who got the ball rolling. But it does not matter much anymore. I have cut all of those people out of my life for good. They have made some threats, all of them turned over to the police, but mostly they were talking big. They still do not know where I live. They blocked me from the facebook group but were too stoned/stupid/ignorant to realize that my MMO character has its own facebook account and it is in the same group where this conversation is still going on. (Probably not anymore after this post.) But it doesn't matter either way as I got a job opportunity in another part of Texas and I am taking it. Four months from now I will be in a completely different city.

I bought a shotgun for the apartment and I am currently waiting on my LTC to come in the mail. Took the class and the shooting course, done my fingerprinting and filled out all the right paperwork. Now to wait 30 years for the state to send it to me. (Actual wait times may vary.) In the meantime I am carrying a pistol in my car. Learned in the class that its legal to keep it in the car as long as it is not on me so went out and bought myself a glock. 

My girlfriend is suggesting I come live with her for a while. I may take her up on that as they do not even know she exists. But it still scares me the lengths they go through to find me online. But I am taking steps to mitigate that. I have disabled my facebook page. Just left up the one for my MMO character and that has 100 percent wrong information on it. My family have stopped mentioning me 100 percent on social media and my girlfriend has disabled her facebook as well. I give her a TON of credit as she is sticking with me through this and not running for the hills. 

So I have a good feeling about the future. I just hope that I can finally put this all behind me. I am tired of dealing with this and just want to move on. But I am taking more steps to protect myself. I found self defense place that teaches both martial arts and urban firearm defense. I am learning basic martial arts and pistol operations atm. Soon it will expand into advanced urban defense training that uses both martial arts and practice guns in the class.

Thank you to everyone who provided help last time. I know you guys love your updates and I'm sorry this one is a little late, but it has a good ending for all parties.

I got in contact with our accounting department to see just how much of an impact, if any, that Sally's antics were causing the store's performance. Apparently, even accounting for other variables, the days Sally worked seemed to dip in productivity when compared to the same dates over the past four years. I collected the data and spoke to HR about it and at that point they agreed that something should be done.

I spoke with Sally and HR together to try to come to an agreement. HR said that, while they do respect Sally's religion, this one aspect was hurting the store, and we couldn't let it continue. They had spoken to a lawyer and they confirmed that it is not considered religious prosecution. It took a while for Sally to come to grips with things, but when HR said that her job was in jeapordy, she relented and said she would suck it up and just process the transactions.

True to her word, a couple hours after the meeting I saw her ring up a $6.66 sale begrudgingly. Funnily enough, she did the sign of the cross right afterwards and does it after every such transaction now.

Thank you again to everyone who commented last time.

Survivorthrowawayabd,2016-06-03 13:21:03+00:00,[Update](Ohio) Mother in law wants to have my child taken away due to me being abused as a child.,"[First post!](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/4hd9mk/ohio_mother_in_law_wants_to_have_my_child_taken/)

 
I forgot my password to the first account. 

I wanted to give an update for everyone going into the weekend. This is a good update. My lawyer and I spoke to the CPS rep and provided all of my son's medical records, and showed every time he went to the doctor, urgent care, ect. CPS also did a walk through the house with the lawyer present and overall the visit went real well. The agent found a few small places for improvement but nothing that was of concern. 


About two weeks after the visit (one week ago) I got another visit from the same CPS agent saying that more accusations have been made against me and my wife this time and that they have to investigate again. I asked if the accuser was my MIL and they could not confirm who made the accusation, but my wife called her mother and she did confirm that it was her mother that made the call again. My wife was on the phone with my MIL while the CPS agent was in the house. I had my wife put her on speakerphone so the CPS agent could hear both sides of the conversation. My wife then asked why are you making false statements to the police and CPS. My MIL response was that since I molested as a child I was 100% going to do it to my son and she wants to protect him. My wife then asked a very pointed question of, ""So you lied to the police and to CPS to further your agenda against my husband?"" The MIL response was ""Yes I lied, but it was for (child's name) safety."" At that point the CPS agent had heard enough filled out some forms and left. 

My wife and I were beyond mad about how brazen the MIL has been acting. I ended up getting a call from the CPS agent and she told me that she had relayed the details of the conversation to my local police department since the MIL had called them to make a report. She said to speak to Detective Bob (not his real name). I reached out the Detective Bob and sat down with him, my wife and lawyer. We ended up filing a report about the false accusations. The good thing in my city is that the police take a no nonsense approach to false accusations and will go after people that do make them. The police did interview my MIL and she did admit to making false statements and lying to police about the about. She now has been charged with falsifying a police report and making one other charge that I forget at the moment, but she has been charged. One a side note Detective Bob was very supportive of me when he found out that the reason why my MIL was making the reports was do to me being molested as a child. He provided phone numbers for help and even brought in a counselor if I needed to talk to one. I was very  surprised of how he treated me with respect throughout the whole process.   

My wife and I have also sat down with an estate lawyer and completely written her out of our life and stated that she is to not have custody of our son. We listed other family members to take care of our son if we both die and the other members have agreed to do this. 

We have also decided to file a small claims court case against the MIL for lawyer fees that we had to pay to cover ourselves. The lawyer did agree to keep the fees to the max for small claims in Ohio. 

TLDR: MIL was caught lying to police and charged. Cut MIL out of our life for good. CPS cleared us of any neglect.

All my plants are gone up to about a 2 feet from my property line.  No warning, no letters asking me to trim them, and now no privacy.  I'm holding back tears right now.

flashinthewindow,2016-05-26 16:40:38+00:00,"[UPDATE] Peeping Tom took pictures of me smoking, trying to blackmail me, is also a huge idiot","Well, I know how much you guys love updates (I love them too) and I'm happy to say I have one for you, much quicker than I expected. 

tl;dr Some stuff went down. 

I got some good advice in the OP as well as some interesting tips from intrepid stoners I probably would have been BFFs with in college. Thanks for all of that. Props to the poster who told me to empty my vacuum bag because I would not have thought of that. 

A few things before I get to the meat of this update:

* Of course I told my husband about all this immediately. I also told him about the initial flash at the window I saw a couple weeks ago when it happened. 

* We do have a monitored home security system, as well as a large dog who is very protective of me in particular. We had actually been meaning to put up security cameras in our backyard before all this happened due to some thefts of lawn tools and such in our neighborhood, and we have a lot of power tools and gardening equipment in our shed out back. I forgot to mention in my OP that after I told my husband about the window flash a couple weeks ago, he went ahead and put the cameras up because he knows I'm paranoid. 

* Yes, I know if I want to totally assure my record stays ""squeaky clean"" I shouldn't be smoking weed in a state where it's not legal to do so. I know I'm taking risks and I accept them; I only ever smoke on my own property or at the houses of friends/family so I feel these risks are minimal. 

* I could not care less about family members finding out I smoke, since they already know and some of them imbibe from time to time as well. I don't work for the government, with children, or in any other sensitive industry and neither does my husband. 

* I had a pretty good idea of who this creepo was. Turns out I was right. 

On to the update. 

We both took the day off work yesterday to deal with this nonsense, and I set up a meeting with my family's lawyer (also a close family friend, which is why I was able to get a meeting so quickly) for this morning. 

The first thing we did was review the camera footage again for the last couple weeks. Nothing there, so we moved on to the neighbors. 

We're pretty friendly with most of our neighbors, and I'm very good friends with a few of them, so we popped over for some visits yesterday. As I mentioned, the suspected creep is known for being a creep in the neighborhood. Being seen in people's yards, staring at women as they jog or walk their dogs, Facebook stalking, you guys probably know the drill. He is the son of a neighbor across the street from me, I thought he was a teenager but turns out he's in his 20s. Neighbor A, who lives next door to him, mentioned that he was a big reason they put up a security fence, as he would often be caught peeking through the hedges at Neighbor A whenever she was in their pool, tanning, or gardening. 

Neighbor B said she actually had some similar Peeping Tom incidents last year: camera flashes at the windows at night whenever her boyfriend wasn't home. She never got any photos or notes, but she did get some bizarre ""gifts"" left on her back patio like a single size 10 red high heeled shoe (I know, wut?), **a lawn statue of a female gnome in a bikini**, and a bag of what appeared to be homemade brownies that she of course threw away. They never put up cameras or anything and never saw or caught who was doing it. She seemed pretty nonchalant about the whole thing which is typical for her I suppose. 

Then I emailed our neighborhood watch coordinator, a woman you DO NOT want to mess around with. I left out the parts about the photos of me getting baked in my underwear and watching Adventure Time and just stuck to ""Peeping Tom might have taken photos of me in my house, left a note in my mailbox.""

Then we went home and I went out back to mess around with the dog. That's when I saw it, placed dead center in one of our garden beds: **a lawn statue of a female gnome in a bikini**. I texted a picture of it to Neighbor B asking her if this was the same one she had also received. It was. There was a piece of paper sticking out from underneath it saying ""Nudes or else. You know what to do."" 

At this I was less freaked out and more just...amused? I don't think this guy really thought this scheme all the way through. I showed my husband we laughed for 5 straight minutes about the absurdity of all this. This idiot didn't even notice the very obvious security cameras put up facing the yard. As my Nana would say ""That boy ain't got the good sense god gave a goose."" 

So we went in and reviewed the security footage. Sure enough, it was who I thought it was, the creep from across the street. We got everything together -- the notes, the photos, garden gnome, and the file from the cameras -- made copies of it all, and went about the rest of our day knowing we'd see our lawyer this morning. 

Then, last night around 10:30, we were getting ready for bed when our doorbell rang. We saw the blue flashes of police car lights through the blinds so honestly my stomach dropped. We had gotten rid of everything incriminating but I was pretty scared. It wasn't the police, (at our house anyway) but the neighborhood watch coordinator, I'll call her NWC. She hadn't responded to my email because she had been dealing with a whole other mess all day. 

Apparently Neighborhood Creep tried to pull the same scheme with someone else. Except it was a 16 year old girl. He had taken photos of her and some friends drinking bud light lime in their backyard as well as photos of her changing clothes through her bedroom window. Luckily she had the good sense to tell her parents AND they also had security cameras installed in their yard. The footage they had of him was at night and he was wearing a hoodie, but he left their yard in the direction of his house and had the same build as Neighborhood Creep. 

The girl had seen the Creep watching her and her friends before so she knew it was him, and I guess other people had complained enough about him that there was enough of a paper trail for the police to come and arrest him (or take him in for questioning? I'm not really sure how these things work but I did see them take him away in a police car). Maybe there was other evidence NWC had, I don't know. 

Anyway NWC asked me if I had any footage of him and recommended I turn it over to the police. I said we'd be talking to our lawyer first but we wanted this guy out of the neighborhood so we'd be in touch with the police and would follow up after we spoke to her this morning. 

We met with our lawyer this morning and gave her all the stuff we had, and told her that this guy had been taken in last night for the same thing. She was very confident that I would not be in any trouble whatsoever for the photos, especially given this guy's now established history of sneaking pictures of women in these sorts of positions for the purpose of trying to (badly) blackmail them. 

The police were at the Creep's house again today putting some boxes of stuff from the house in their cars. I do feel bad for his mother. She's actually a very nice woman if a bit doormat-y. 

Anyway, that's that for now. We'll be keeping all our weed and accessories at my brother-in-law's house for now and neither of us will be smoking until this whole thing is resolved, just in case. 

Thanks for all your advice and tips everyone. I will update again later if there's anything to update on. 

P. S. The bikini lawn gnome is currently in the possession of my lawyer or the police, but I hope to be able to recover it after this is all done. I kinda want to display it in the front yard as a trophy.

holyshitwatdo21,2016-05-17 03:43:13+00:00,Update - Friends who gave me shrooms against my will.,"Dallas Texas

Welp this went from shitty to total fucking screwjob in one day. The video that was recorded was set to unlisted on youtube and only shared between a few friends. One of them downloaded the video, besides me, and put it up on facebook. Unfortunately the video only shows me freaking out because of drugs. So all it proves is that I ""went on a trip."" I was able to get the video taken down by my friend saying my boss can see it and I can get fired. He at least removed it. I submitted a claim on the youtube video and hopefully it gets taken down. (Harmful and Dangerous acts flag)

I went to the police last night and told them everything that happened. I spoke with either a sergeant or a detective later on. (not too sure which) I told him everything that had happened and showed him the video. I showed him the text messages and let him listen to a voicemail message from the girlfriend of the guy who fed me the shroom burger. She had told me that I needed to stop freaking out and the reason they did this was because I needed to loosen up. Im not a drug user and even I know that weed is how you loosen up. Not shrooms. And finally this is the part that I feel the most shitty about. I told the officer that my friends all probably have a decent amount of weed or x at their places. 

So after giving everything to the guy he told me that he may need to contact me later. Fast forward to about 6-7ish tonight and facebook is lighting up. Everyone except myself and one other person was arrested who was at the party. I do not know the exact reason everyone was arrested but it appears to be possession and not what happened to me. I really do not know how I feel about that. 

I know that two of the four were arrested with meth and ex on them. I am fairly sure that the guy who hosted the party had a good amount of weed on him too. (He always has weed.)

EDIT: I was not giving out all of the details in this post, just keeping things light for various reasons. I do not know why the arrests happen so fast. I can only speculate. Judging by the facebook posts in this long assed chain of messages, the first guy who was arrested was arrested a few hours before the others. He lives with his parents. These are normal working class people who just happen to have a shithead for a son. From what I can gather, which is basically through the grapevine of facebook, his parents must have consented to a search.

Thanks everyone for the advice you gave me on my first post, it was very helpful.

A week or two after I made my first post, I received an email back from uber saying that they were looking into the matter, but couldn't comment further because it was a personnel issue. I checked my bank account the next day and saw that Uber had refunded me the $200 cleaning charge, but I did not hear anything else from them. Since the uber driver and I still had a court date, I put the $200 aside so that I wouldn't accidentally spend it.

Yesterday was our court date and the uber driver attempted to sue me for $1200, plus the $200 fee refunded to me by uber because the driver had been fired. I told the judge my side of the story and showed the judge the text messages and the receipts from uber. The judge wouldn't accept a print out of the text messages, but he allowed me to show the messages directly from my iphone. 

The judge ruled in my favor and ordered the driver to pay the court costs. Everything worked out and my surgery is scheduled for next week.

Primarily, I want to thank you all for the help and providing clarity. I was clearly getting some tunnel vision and not thinking through the possible routes to handle this so all of you here really made my life easier.

I ended up calling the court who transferred me to the prosecuting attorney's office. The woman I spoke with was incredibly helpful and told me they obviously aren't charging me with anything and that the idea to take the passport in was good. She actually called the police department for me and told them to give my ID back if I brought in a passport as you all suggested. She also stated that the only record of the incident would be internal.

Yesterday, I went to the police station with a passport and got my ID back within about 5 minutes. The police chief talked to me and told me how sorry he was and said that the officers that made my life harder would be disciplined. While that may or may not be the case, I really appreciated the apology and it seemed like it came from the heart.

Although I was initially scared about talking to the prosecutor, especially with the whole don't talk to the police thing, she was more helpful than I could have ever imagined. Even though the police caused a minor annoyance, the resolution of the situation was overwhelmingly positive and the people I met with there this time around seemed really genuine.

Thanks again for all of your help and I'm happy to say that it came to a positive end.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/4g44l3/update_charged_with_fake_id_washington_was_not/,legaladvice,1135,37,

No legal shenanigans, but there was cake.","I wanted to say thanks for all of the advice and support I got when I posted on here a while back. I was in a pretty shitty place, and I can't describe how awesome it was to have literally hundreds of people telling me what a pathetic douche-chill my ex is. 

As my title suggests, I don't have a thrilling update for you. A lot of you warned me to be on the lookout for him trying to take back the ring himself, which my family and friends were also worried about. I'm very blessed to come from a large family, so on Monday afternoon a few of my male cousins/second cousins/concerned family friends (and their firearms) came to my apartment to ""keep [me] company"". My female cousins didn't want to be left out, so they came, too (several of them also toting firearms). Through a garbled family phone tree, one of my uncles completely misconstrued the purpose of the ""family gathering at ringthrowaway1010's house"", and arrived bearing a case of liquor and a massive Publix sheet cake. My grandfather eventually showed up with his banjo and some beautiful pictures of my grandmother wearing the ring in question. 

As you can imagine, this turned into one of our better parties, and ""ringthrowaway 1010's congratulations on not marrying an asshole party"" will live on in family lore. 

Since my original post I've gotten a lot of extremely nice messages and calls from my ex's family, all of whom are currently not speaking to him. (His brother called me the day after the Table Incident to ask what happened, and I told him the truth, which I can only assume was passed around.) His dad assured me that my ex won't be trying to sue me for the ring, and told me that if I ever hear from my ex again, I should call his dad and he will ""bring the pain"". He also sent me a gift card for several hundred dollars to Home Depot, in case I ever want to ""make a better table for a better man"". Hopefully, that will be the last thing about this breakup that makes me cry. 

I also got an STI screening, which turned out negative. My gyno said that everything looked ""perfect, absolutely pristine"". So I may not be getting married in three months, but at least I have pristine genitalia. 

Tl;dr: Family came to keep me safe in case ex came back for ring, devolved into raucous family party complete with cake and grandpa on banjo. Ex is experiencing full-on Amish shunning from his family, his dad bought me a gift card to HoDep for future carpentry endeavors. Not only am I STI-free, my vagina is ""pristine"".

My co worker and I had already applied for unemployment before I posted. I was denied because the company claimed I was insubordinate (for refusing to get in the vehicle). My co worker was also denied. I was considering what to do next but my co worker was mad and she went to social media. There was lots of backlash and anger and the company ended up offering me some severance. It was a fair enough amount so I took it because I just wanted this over with. I didn't know my co worker was injured by a drunk driver before. She didn't take the severance and is suing them because she told me it's not about the money for her.

So not really advice seeking just updating everyone on the resolution. So all of this is second hand knowledge so if it sounds like I do not know what happened, it is because I really don't know the full details. 

My grandmom's lawyer apparently filed a motion to dismiss and it was granted. He informed her friday that the county is dropping the charges against her. 

So rather boring update here but thankfully it went our way. As for the specifics, I do not know everything as my grandmom called me last night to let me know. FIgured I would update all of you who were invested in the story somehow on what happened. 


So recap. Grandmom buys 400 bucks worth of grocery, forgets cokes, takes them back to pay, gets cops called. Go to county courthouse pleas not guilty gets a court date. 

Lawyer files motion to dismiss on whatever grounds, I am guessing the absurdity of the charges, and its granted. 

Victory. 

Edit: Half the people here are saying things like lesson learnd. Dont return to walmart. 

Honestly I was shocked that this happened to her. The one I shop at does not act like this. They are more chill. But I guess the walmart where my grandma shopped at is full of idiots. 

The moral is don't assume that everyone will do the right thing. Survey the situation and decide if going back to correct your mistake is worth it. If your store is known for dbaggery don't go back.

vacationdaythrowaway,2016-04-07 14:00:33+00:00,Update: [FL] Just informed by my manager that they will never approve my vacations again because I'm too important. Is this legal?,"Hello, everyone. First thread [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/3h3es7/fl_just_informed_by_my_manager_that_they_will/). Several people requested updates, so here it is.

tl;dr: Retail store employer promoted me to position that gives PTO, told me to not bother ever applying to use it because I was too good at my job.

Long story short, many people suggested that they were joking, or that I was intentionally trying to start shit. Unfortunately, that's not the case.

I tried to apply for the same weekend off that I had the year before, being July 7-12. Only six days, instead of seven. Not ideal, but better than nothing.  

Management countered by claiming that these days were now ""blackout"" days, because of their proximity to 4th of July. Somehow, they claimed, the department I worked in was expected to be ""exceptionally busy"" three days *after* 4th of July. This was not the case last year, obviously, as I was able to take the time off just fine. Only now was this made a rule, and only after I applied for the time off.

I attempted to appeal to management by mentioning that I had taken the same days off last year, but no dice. They refused to even consider it. I informed them that this was the only week I was interested in taking off at all, and that when I interviewed with this company I had *specifically* told them that this was non-negotiable -- I took this week off every year, paid or unpaid, and during the interview they had agreed to those terms. Not a single fuck was given, they shrugged and told me ""sorry, but it's a blackout date"" and that ""if I could take it off, they'd have to let everyone take it off."" I told them I didn't see a problem with that -- they laughed in my face. ""Well, it's just something we can't do.""

I've since quit the position -- not only due to this, but several other issues as well, mostly hating my job so much I've been diagnosed with clinical anxiety and depression and now take medication to remedy those. I spoke with my mother and she is graciously allowing me to live with her for a year and a half while I return to school full time and finish my degree in Computer Science, and hopefully am able to launch myself into a much better job than menial labor in a retail store. It sucks having to move back in with mom, but I'll *gladly* suffer through a year and a half of that if it means I don't have to return to retail.

I didn't really think an immediate update was that necessary considering the scope of the situation but I keep getting messages about it.

Things have settled considerably since last week. Before updating I wanted to clarify some things. It wasn't until last night that I got time to really sit down and read the responses. First off, a lot of the advice was drastically different than the advice I got from my lawyer (who is in family law).

Some  of the questions asked were very off topic, irrelevant and odd so I am going to just answer everything here. 

 I was able to get my child back from CPS the next morning around 11am, after speaking to a case manager. The police were actually present during this conversation. I'm not going into a lot of detail here as it has been a really emotional time.My lawyer was present. There is a hearing this week but my lawyer isn't worried. He has all my communication with my ex husband for the entire year about the wedding, my checking in from the resort daily, a statement from the school  about the agreement made with my ex-husband about picking the child up extra days for the days I would be out of the country. 
   
Where was my ex-husband and father of the child? Was he dead?

No, he was not dead. As I had said, he had been updating facebook. He had decided that a week would not work for his schedule, and without telling me, had just unilaterally Tuesday morning decided not to go get our child. He said he had meant to tell me monday when I called to speak to our child and check up  but had ""forgotten"". He on the advice of a lawyer he decided to retain on Friday has no other further comment to make to me, the police, CPS, or our child regarding the issue which he says was just a miscommunication. 

Why didn't the police do a welfare check?

I called them from our mexican resort waiting at the airport to catch a plane out  and they actually did do a welfare check on his residence. They were unable to locate him there. They actually located him Thursday, detained him and questioned him. He was held Thursday night but was released Friday after getting a lawyer. From what I am understanding he is under investigation. 

Why wasn't I concerned about his well-being? He could be dead in a ditch. 

My ex husband is an adult. My five year old son was in the custody of the state and I was 10 hours away in another country. My focus was on getting home to my child. I called the police to inform him of his address. They checked on him. He was updating facebook regularly. I am not sure why I should have been focused on him. My focus was getting home to my secure the safety of my child. 

Why didn't your new husband go with you?

We were at a resort in Mexico with 15 plus guests who had flown out for our wedding. Someone had to stay behind to wrap things up. He managed to get a ticket out for the afternoon of the next day after making sure all our guests were taken care of, he stayed in constant contact with me the entire time and rushed back as soon as he reasonably could. His own family was there from far away. He was great about the whole thing.  

Why didn't your son attend the wedding?

My son is 5. We got married on a coastal resort in mexico that is mostly for adults. At the time we were able to get a very good deal on a honeymoon/wedding that we wouldn't have otherwise gotten but it was during some of their spring break traffic. Considering the location, the need to leave the country (yes, his father would have had to approve per our custody agreement), and the fact that it was also our honeymoon (guests were just flying out for the two day wedding), we discussed with my ex-husband the best course of action. He agreed that our son staying with him would be the best idea. More time with dad, camping locally, school time, everything added up to a plus. I also thought it important that my new husband and I be afforded some alone time (four days) to celebrate our marriage. His father suddenly disappearing or being irresponsible is unusual for him. He has never not shown up or done what he is suppose to do. I had no reason to assume this wouldn't be anything other than a normal visit with dad with just a few extra days added. 
 
Why didn't you ask your family to keep your son at the resort?

Our friends and family graciously agreed to pay for their own stays and tickets. They took time off from their lives and families to fly out and have fun with us. My mother has been prepping for this day for two years and spent a lot of money on it. It would have been unfair to ask a guest to give up their vacation away from their own children and/or lives to watch our child. Again, it was an inappropriate place to have children. 

Why didn't your ex-husband's mother pick your son up?

No clue. She also has declined to comment. 

What about custody moving forward?

Right now, my lawyer has filed some paperwork to temporarily suspend visitation for my ex husband until after a hearing and investigation as to why our son was left. There is an emergency hearing tomorrow but my ex husband hasn't even attempted to contact our child since I got back. 

Why did you use her instead of him once?

Typo. I was on my phone, in a rush and panic, at an airport. 

Why did you use the term ""child""?

I am not sure. Child seems like an appropriate word when describing the situation to people especially when avoiding too much identifying information.  

Why did you divorce your first husband? You got what you deserved. ""I'm not saying he's not a dick, and he's not liable for civil and criminal penalties. I'm just saying sometimes you gotta be careful what you wish for.""

I don't even know how to address this but I didn't get a lot of questions about why we divorced and who divorced who and why I had so much custody. 

1) He asked for the divorce because he was unhappy. We tried counseling and it didn't work. We got along fairly well for a while but it was obvious as we aged that we were incompatible.  He filed and I didn't push the issue. 

2) Our son was a new born around the time the divorce was finalized. Having a child was a choice we both made together but he seemed overwhelmed by the sudden and newness of being a parent. The custody agreement we have is the one he initially submitted to the court in his petition for a divorce. He never asked for more. The child support is merely the state standard for his income. It was imputed by the judge at a hearing he was at with his lawyer and me and my lawyer. They signed off on it without any question. 

The whole divorce was pretty boring and really undramatic. 

Why did you leave your child and go to another country?

I don't know. I guess so I could get married to my new husband and be with him alone for four days. I spent a year planning it with the father. He agreed. They had camping plans. I didn't think taking a honeymoon away from my child while that child was with another parent was that unusual.

How'd you get a ticket back so fast?

I had a return ticket. I went to the counter, told them I needed to get home ASAP and why. I paid money. They put me on standby for a flight. I was lucky enough to get on one quickly.  
 
How is your son?

He is great now. It was a little scary for him but he is home safe now and back in his routine. 

Was it worth it?

To attempt to go on my honeymoon and give his previously responsible father extra time, yes. Did it work out how I planned? No. Am I angry about that? Yes. Am I angry at myself? Yes. Should I be? My therapist says no. A lot of unplanned things in life happen. I did what I could with the situation that happened. 

Am I angry at my ex-husband?

Yes, for leaving our child alone and scared. For taking out frustrations about me or inconveniences on a small child. Or whatever reasoning he has.  

So now you are going to get full custody right?

I don't know. I am going to do whatever is best to make sure no leaving or abandoning ever happens again. That is really out of my hands now. He made the decision he made and now there are hearings and consequences and he has to deal with his end of it, just as I did mine. 

What about the money spent on the honeymoon?

We were able to transfer the extra days at the resort to some friends of ours so that wouldn't go to waste. 

Will you be trying to get your money back?

I haven't even thought about addressing that and I don't think that is appropriate action until after getting the other things situated so I haven't even asked my lawyer about it. Honestly, it isn't a top priority. 
 
 Any further contact from CPS?

Of course. I would expect there to be. They will be at our hearing tomorrow. Everyone just want to figure out what happened, why, and what the best course of action going forward is. It is all pretty reasonable. 



  
         


There is an update.

mattolol,2016-04-04 18:51:59+00:00,"UPDATE: My neighbors caused themselves to be landlocked, I posted here, it's resolved now","I posted here for advice a while back and received some excellent, some funny and some conflicting advice from all of you.  The overwhelming advice was to get a lawyer, which I did. I explained the situation and that I had posted here, as well as the many topics you all prompted me to read up on (which was very helpful).  While my lawyer seemed pleased with your advice to me, he also urged me to immediately stop publicly posting about the situation, which I did (and which I see from my many messages has disappointed all of you!)

First thing's first: everything worked out in my favor.

My wife was upset by the entire situation and especially concerned with our children, and she got involved as well.  She spoke with some friends who were able to get her in touch with the local city council. They could not explicitly do anything direct to help us but did get us in touch with some of the right people to discuss our situation.

One of the most important results from those connections was learning that the ""sheriff"" who we spoke to was actually a deputy who was acting on the sheriff's behalf. We were able to meet with the actual sheriff.  He did agree that we should be more open to compromise but was much more willing to admit that we had no immediate legal reason to do so, and no interest in forcing us to.

My lawyer made a key point of the fact (I use the term loosely) that if the neighbors require an easement to access their land, they should so so with the land they sold, and not with unrelated land. After a lot of back and forth (but no court proceedings, luckily) with the other party, their attention was refocused on the buyer of their land. Funny enough, it's a small world and I ended up meeting the buyer who was in my lawyer's office for a consultation with one of his partner's. He ended up needing to get a different lawyer (since I already had a lawyer from the firm, as I understand it) but we did keep in contact to some extent.

Now, some speculation: we believe that the reason the neighbors didn't bother us for a while was their finances; their lawyer was happy to keep pushing as long as he was getting paid, but when money ran dry he lost interest. 

Due (we believe) to those financial problems as well as their inability to find a quick solution, the neighbors ultimately moved into town and lived with family there for several months. The neighbor on the other side gave them one-time access with a moving truck. Their lawyer had been showing up with them but was gone at that time, which is another reason I suspect major money issues.

In the fall the situation picked up again, with contact from a new lawyer this time. This new lawyer requested a meeting with us (and our lawyer, of course). He requested that we consider buying their property to resolve the issue. We initially said no, they offered it to the owner on the other side, they said no, they sweetened the pot. Eventually the price was right and my wife and I had developed an interest in more land. We discussed terms, then decided against it, they went a little cheaper again, we purchased their land.

I nearly posted an update once the purchase was complete but there was an additional interesting detail that came out of the woodwork, and brought new legal questions. The neighbors had used their land and home as collateral for an informal loan and the person who lent to them wanted the property when they failed to repay him. He came after us.  The outcome of this was that they are the ones who failed their end of the contract, so his problem was with the neighbors, NOT with us.  This is definitely a sideline from the original situation but caused a delay in my ability to update.

As of today, my wife and I are out a substantial amount of money due to legal fees, which it turned out was not worth going after from the neighbors. There is also bad news in that the home on that property was essentially worth even less than we thought, and there were major issues beyond the land itself (septic tank failure, leaking oil tank).  Those expenses were slightly mitigated by insurance but we are out a good some.

We also had a hard time combining the plots, which was legally desirable to build anything that straddled the two property lines. However the plots are now combined into one large plot.

The good is that the neighbors are no longer an issue for us, and by this summer their property should be in good shape to use for a new project of our own. On one hand, I will say this: the little chunk of land was definitely not worth the time and stress involved in this process, nor the money. However, the outcome was positive for our family (for which there is no dollar value) and it's all over with now.

My sincere thanks to everyone who offered advice.  There are far too many of you to thank individually, but please know that I appreciated everyone's contributions and I hope you're all still around to read my much delayed resolution.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/4dci57/update_my_neighbors_caused_themselves_to_be/,legaladvice,5263,517,
dress_code_trouble,2016-03-27 22:17:57+00:00,I'm a manager and I'm being asked to fire someone for a reason that makes me uncomfortable (fire a woman who follows the male dress code and wears a suit to work),"I could really use some advice. I'm an office manager. The office in keeps inventory records for a sales company. We don't deal with customers or the public at large at all and 99.99% of our interactions with head office or other branches of the company is by email or over the phone. We have an in person visit from head office or another branch every year or year and a half if something is important. Otherwise all our meetings are done as conferences over the phone.

One of the employees (we'll call her Susan) has worked here for three years. Susan is one of my hardest working employees and a rising star in the company. She has received employee of the month and other awards and gets along great with everyone. The issue now is that Susan wears suits and dress shoes similar to what men wear. Neither myself or any of the other employees care because Susan is a good person and she does her job well. But one of the board members from head office visited two weeks ago and when he saw Susan working at her desk he flipped out on me in my office when he found out she was a woman in a suit who was Susan and not another male employee using her computer.

Now the board is telling me I have to fire her for violating the dress code and for unprofessional behavior. The company dress code states that employees must:

1) wear a business suit consisting of a skirt (not more than an inch above the knee), pantyhose or tights, a long sleeved collared dress shirt with buttons that does not show cleavage or collar bones and is tucked in, a blazer, non open toe dress shoes (not boots) that are flat or have a heel of no more than 2 inches, natural makeup (not flamboyant or overdone) hair pulled back if it is long enough and if not than groomed and not unkempt with no undercuts and if desired, tasteful, minimal jewelry consisting of no more than an non oversized necklace, an engagement and/or wedding ring, a watch and if required a piece of medical ID jewelry.  

OR

2) A suit consisting of dress slacks and a jacket, plain black or gray socks, long sleeved, ironed, collared shirt with buttons that is tucked in, a tie, non open toe dress shoes (not boots) that are not high heels, no makeup at all, hair that is not longer than four inches and is groomed and not unkempt, and and if desired, tasteful, minimal jewelry consisting of no more than a wedding ring, a watch and if required a piece of medical ID jewelry.

All suits must be black, gray, brown or navy blue only. All suits and collared dress shirts must be a single colour only. Neither may have stripes or patterns. No hats or headcoverings are to be worn. No employee may have any visible tattoos or piercings, hair must be a natural color (blonde, red, black, brown or gray) and non outlandish style and all employees are to be clean shaven in the face. Exceptions for facial hair, no makeup and head coverings for religious or cultural reasons shall be allowed on a case by case and must first be approved by the manager.

The dress code says nothing about male or female but in my experience of almost 15 years of working here women follow the first one and men follow the second. I have never had an issue before because it is clearly laid out and accommodations are made for religious and cultural reasons without a hassle. Susan does follow the second dress code. Someone from head office came here once before since Susan started working here but she was off that day. This was the first time any of them saw her. All their interactions with her (such as her interview and meetings) have been over the phone or by email. They have praised her for years until one of them saw her. Now they want me to fire her and rescind all the awards and bonuses the company has paid. I also lost my bonus for allowing her unprofessional behavior and the board has admonished me for not telling them. Susan doesn't know about any of this. I don't feel good about firing her for this reason and I'm not even sure if it's legal in New York state. I have several emails about this from the board. I'm supposed to be enjoying Easter with my family that I went out of state to visit but this is really bothering me. I tried calling HR but they are useless and said it's okay for me to fire gay people and ""cross dressers"". I know Susan only wears men's clothes but I don't know or care if she is gay. But I'm not comfortable doing what they are asking me to do and could really use some help or direction.

Edited to clarify: The company has branches and offices all over the northeastern United States, not just in my state. Head office is Massachusetts.

[deleted],2016-03-23 23:00:42+00:00,Update- My coworker adopted a kid from the Ukraine a couple of years ago. Now she's going around work asking us to adopt him and writing about giving him away on Facebook.,"Let me start with saying a huge thank you to everyone in this subreddit that replied to my post. Now that the dust has settled a bit, I’m honestly kinda overwhelmed by the number of people that went to huge lengths to tell me about just how serious this situation was/is, deep dived on resources, ect. I got PM’s from people that worked for local and state governments and private agencies that were outside of my state but offered their contacts. I had people that spoke Russian/Ukrainian offering to help contact the Ukrainan Embassy and offered me contact information for Embassy departments. People even contacted us offering money for Tony’s immediate needs in the event we decided to take him in. I’m sincerely touched by the genuine concern all of you had for Tony and his siblings and I hope one day I can tell Tony that despite everything that’s happened, there’s people out there like you guys that care about him. The information you guys gave us helped us act fast and got the ball rolling on this situation faster than me and my boyfriend would’ve figured out alone.

I talked with the cops about the situation and honestly? They were just as confused as I was. The person I talked to on the phone was just as stumped but he agreed that at a minimum they did need to do a welfare check. I’ve had experiences with welfare checks before and I had the nagging feeling that something just wouldn’t go right…and someone PM’d me the priority line for my state’s child protective services hotline. I got someone on the phone right away, and as soon as I mentioned that trafficking could be going on and that she was advertising the kid on Facebook (it was a public post here too, people), they acted with a quickness. I gave them all the information I had on Mary and Tony and all the information I had from Mary about Tony’s adoption. The person I spoke to right away said that she suspected that the adoption MIGHT NOT EVEN BE LEGAL. I was floored. I e-mailed all the screenshots I had to the person I spoke with and asked for a followup if that was at all possible. I said that myself and my boyfriend were willing to take Tony on a temporary basis if necessary, but the CPS representative said that likely wasn’t possible. Then, the waiting game began. Last night was probably the most stressful night I’ve ever had- hell at one point, I was ready to drive out to Mary’s house myself but was stopped by my boyfriend. It was tough.

The cops followed up with us at approximately 2:00AM. Note that I haven’t heard from CPS. The officer I spoke with was very cautious and limited in what he said, but he told me that CPS arrived at the home shortly after he did. In not so many words, he implied that Mary had been talking to someone about meeting Tony the very next day and that CPS’ suspicions were confirmed— Tony’s adoption was not legal. Tony was rehomed to Mary and her husband from another state where placement needs to be approved by a judge. He didn’t elaborate further except to say that other issues came to light and all of the children were removed from the home for their own safety by CPS. He didn’t say how long they were there, but said it was “a long time”. I was asked to drop off all e-mails and printouts to the station in the morning, and I agreed.

My boyfriend and I wanted to make doubly sure that all of our bases were checked, so I called our local FBI office who said they lacked jurisdiction in the matter but would be writing up a complaint and referring the issue to the State Department. We called the Ukrainian Embassy and made a detailed complaint and I included the contact information I had for the officer from the department.

The shit really hit the fan when I went into work to printout the e-mail. Our company is pretty small and the company owner, (I’ll call her Big Ange because of her resemblance to the Mob Wives lady) had gotten wind of Mary’s email. Big Ange was FURIOUS, and waiting at Mary’s desk to see if she would show up for work. My friend reported that Big Ange waited from 7:15 - 9:30 AM, and that Mary CAME TO WORK WITH A SOB STORY ABOUT HOW HER KIDS WERE BEING UNFAIRLY TAKEN AWAY! Mary wanted time off from work to “clear her name” and “devote herself to re-claiming her family from this misunderstanding”. I wasn’t there to witness this, but Big Ange, who has six kids herself, apparently ripped Mary a new asshole. Mary has been dismissed and rumor has it that Big Ange may or may not allow her to claim unemployment.

My head is honestly still spinning from everything that has happened. The past 24 hours have been insanity. I’m so grateful that the system worked as quickly as it did. I only hope it works out a long term solution to this problem and that Mary doesn’t get to reclaim her kids. My heart is breaking for Tony and the other kids right now…I don’t know what the fuck was happening in Mary’s house that made CPS remove them that night, but I’m going to sleep better knowing that they aren’t with psycho ass Mary and her husband, at least for awhile. What the future holds for Tony and the other kids (especially because Tony’s adoption was apparently illegal) makes me sick…but I’m going to wish for the best.

I need a damn drink.

tl;dr: CPS took the kids. They're safe. Mary has been fired from work. Redditors amaze me with their kindness and willingness to help in times of crisis.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/4bozha/update_my_coworker_adopted_a_kid_from_the_ukraine/,legaladvice,3047,179,
[deleted],2016-03-23 00:03:46+00:00,[DE] URGENT: My coworker adopted a kid from the Ukraine a couple of years ago. Now she's going around work asking us to adopt him and writing about giving him away on Facebook.,"So, my co-worker is kind of a weirdo (I'll call her Mary for the sake of this post). Her and her husband are one of those people that have a ton of adopted kids (eight so far) and are super religious. To each his own. Mary enjoys telling everyone at work her business, so when she decided to adopt a kid from the Ukraine, everyone heard about it. She went with an older kid because it was easier for her and her husband (she says). This was two years ago.

Mary has asked me to babysit the boy a couple of times (I'll call him Tony), and it's never been a problem because I like kids. I didn't see any glaring problems despite Mary's constant dramatics about how awful the kid was and he seemed to like being over (it's just me and my boyfriend here, and our place is small but clean and really well kept. Mary's house is...disgusting for lack of a better word). Mary would harp constantly about how much Tony liked it at our house but I just chalked it up to the kid having a good time.

Lately Mary has been at work, talking to anyone that'll listen about how awful Tony is, how horrible he is to the other kids, and how she's going to get rid of him. She sent out a freaking mass email to everyone in our department asking if someone wanted to take her kid from her. She calls it ""re-homing"" and that its okay. I logged onto Facebook today and same story...she has pics of Tony posted to her timeline advertising him for re-adoption and to contact her if interested!!

I haven't replied to her email yet, and I haven't commented on her post but I'm this close to ripping into her for what she's doing. She's crossed the line from weird into full blown psycho. Should I call CPS? I called the police just now, but they sounded completely confused on what to do. They agreed to a welfare check. The post is still up. Is this really legal?! I don't know much about adoption and a quick search for rehoming gets me mostly results about animals. Any advice?

EDIT: Shit has hit the fan. There's mass insanity right now, but I'll have an update for everyone tonight. Most importantly: the kids are safe. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/4bk5th/de_urgent_my_coworker_adopted_a_kid_from_the/,legaladvice,1314,235,
Debateclassthrowaway,2016-03-20 15:03:02+00:00,[FL] My classmates parents want to sue me because of what happened in debate class.,"It's a public high school and we're in 11th grade. I'll refer to my classmate as John.

At my school instead of having debate club they made it into an elective class. There's about 30 of us in class. Each class certain people are picked to debate each other on a topic. We're given the topic a week in advance to prepare.

My topic this week was self driving cars and wether or not they would be beneficial. My position was against and Johns was for. At the end of class everyone voted and I won. That was Thursday.

On Friday Johns mom came up to me and told me that they were going to sue me for emotional distress. Apparently since my argument focused mostly on poverty and the growing divide between the upper class and middle/working class it disturbed John.

This is apparently what caused him to have some sort of crisis on Thursday night. He supposedly even had a panic attack.

So can they sue me and what do I do?

Diplipper,2016-03-17 19:50:23+00:00,[PA] I (18m) received unsolicited nude photos from a girl in my class (16f) UPDATE,"Hey guys,

I was getting notifications from reddit all day! Thanks so much for your advice, I appreciated all of it and read every comment. So today at school I got called into the office during first period. All of the principals were there and asked me right off the bat if I had received any photos from the classmate. I immediately asked why they were questioning me and they told me that someone had reported me for trying to get explicit photos from the girl. At this point I had already read some of the advice posted and had deleted the photos, told the girl through text that I did not ask for those photos and that I did not want her texting me ever again, and then I proceeded to block her number and block her from all social media before she had a chance to respond. I told the deans the truth; she sent me photos I never asked for and that I immediately told her not to do so ever again and had blocked her after deleting the photos. They asked to see the text messages between us and I told them to search her phone instead and that I would not be giving them my phone or passcode. They tried to hardball me with threats of calling a police officer in to question me and I repeated that they should question her first and check her phone instead of questioning me.

So after about 20 minutes of back and forth with them they allowed me to return to class with my phone still in my possession with the warning that they may be pulling me out of class later in the day. As I was waiting in line for my lunch a little after noon, I overheard kids talking in the line behind me about the girl. Apparently she was called into the office and ended up getting suspended for ten days, although they never said what it was over.

I got called back into the office at the very end of the day where again I sat with the three principals. This time they apologized for questioning me so harshly and told me that ""appropriate action"" had been taken over the situation, although they wouldn't give me any details on what exactly happened. I was told I was not going to be punished and that they did not need to see my phone anymore. My assumption is that when she was called into the office she gave up her phone and the principals saw the messages. I'm still not sure who reported me to the office but I also found out today that my girlfriend got into an argument with this girl yesterday in class, so I think maybe the girl tried to set me up as revenge, although this is just a guess on my part. Regardless, it appears that I'm out of the woods and I don't have to worry about this anymore, I hope. 

I just wanted to give everyone who helped an update and once again say thank you for all your advice. At this point I think the situation is over and dealt with, and although I don't know all the details, I'm just glad it all got handled without me getting in trouble.

I did learn alot but I still wasn't sure all about things like punative damages or restitutions. So I asked one of my teachers and I told her all about my cousin and she listened to me explain it. She said that my cousin had to pay because he got sued by the girl he gave the drugs to. That's why he had to go to court two times and have two different lawyers because it was two different things. She said the money my cousin has to pay for 18 years of child support was what she won from suing him. So now I understand and I learned some stuff about the law in florida and everywhere else too. My teacher is gonna talk to my parents for me too so they can know I don't like having to talk to my cousin and visit him. I know and think what he did was bad and I'm sorry if my words weren't telling that like some people said. I'm going to high school next year and my teacher I can take classes about law there.

JustLand,2016-02-28 23:02:48+00:00,California - Tennant theft issue,"I purchased my first rental house in October and have been renting it to a college student since late December. I felt pretty comfortable renting it to this student because his dad owns a building moving company and had deep pockets, so I didn't need to worry too much about if they did damage to the property and I could expect rent on time. The father signed on the rental contract and pays the rent.

In January the AC unit in the house went out and I was quoted several thousand to get it replaced. Due to unrelated personal financial issues I wasn't able to get the work done immediately. I didn't want to leave my tenant without AC so I offered his father the chance to prepay 4 months rent so I could get the AC replaced immediately. I was just trying to make the best of a bad situation. 

The father was rightly pissed and chewed me out over the phone for a bit. Two days later he showed up at my house drunk and threatening/screaming/etc and saying I'd pay for screwing his son. He left after I threatened to call the police. I never heard anything from him after this, but rent kept showing up, so I decided to forget about it since the son shouldn't suffer for his fathers faults. 

I finally had the money to get the AC replaced so I scheduled the contractor to have it installed on Wednesday. Texted the son that the AC would be replaced on Wednesday and he just said ""Haha sure"". On Wednesday the contractor couldn't find the house. He told me there was no house at the address I gave him. I double checked the address with the realtor and against some documents I had but the contractor insisted it was wrong, so I scheduled him again yesterday morning so I could drive him to the house. The contractor was right, there's no longer a home at the address.

The father and son aren't responding to me any longer, but I've left voicemails. The neighbors confirmed that the house had indeed been taken by the fathers moving company. I'm really kind of shocked. I don't even know how to precede. The only reason I'm not freaking out is I know that I the father has the money the pay for this monumental fuck up. Will insurance cover this sort of thing? What type of lawyer do I need? If I find the house will I have ownership of the land it's on? Will I need to move it back to my property? Can a house be moved twice? Does this sort of thing require a permit, and could I get in trouble if he didn't have one?

***Original text:***
I messaged this girl on the app a couple days ago saying hey. She replied and said ""message me your number and I'll text you."" Keep in mind to use the Skout adult app you need to sign an agreement that you're at least 18. I was an idiot and gave out my number. She texted me next day and we sexted about 10 minutes. I received only one nude pic and it looked like just some random vagina. I sent a few things and she stopped texting. Today her ""dad"" calls me and says she is actually a minor and he's willing to not press charges if i'm willing to ""help him out"" by Western unioning him almost $5000. I'm really scared, I'm 25, live in DFW and never been in any trouble my whole life. I also have a great career. She supposedly lives in SC somewhere. Is he bluffing or not, that is what I'm faced with. If he isn't and he does press charges will I be okay since she lied when signing up for the site? The last thing I want to do is go to court. :, (




***Updated Information:***
I did as you guys have informed me. I blocked his number and didn't hear anything back until the next day. When I woke up I had another text from him (I could tell because it was same area code) on a different phone. It said ""(My Name), why did you block me? I was starting to think your a nice guy but I guess you want to get the police involved. It would be a shame to expose you at work like this as well"" 

ALSO, I received a call that had my area code in it that left me a voice message!!!
I listened to the voice message and basically just said, ""Hey (my name) I'm a sheriff with (my local police department) and I have a complaint about you with so and so's daughter and her father. Please call me back ASAP.""

I have a friend who knows an undercover cop, he traced back the original numbers the guy was calling me from.. both disposables. He checked the number from the supposed police officer, disposable as well. He called it and went straight to a voice mail.

I then called my city police department to see if there were any records or complaints filed against me about anything. Not in the database at all! Then I called the police department for another town over (I was told it was where the number was from or something like that, I don't know how numbers work like that) I  talked to a Sergeant for Criminal Investigations. I told him everything that was going on, he said yeah it's a scam don't do anything. He kind of had a laugh about it.

So that's where I'm at with this right now, I also changed my phone number just to stop this shit for good. I didn't get much sleep last night, I've never been involved with something like this before. Thank you guys for helping me out, I think I would have seriously sent money to the guy if it wasn't for ya'll telling me it's a known scam.

**Edit:** Thank-you all for all the positivity in here. This is actually my first time posting on Reddit and has been quite the experience. I have my main account but just been lurking with that for about 2 years now. Thanks again from the bottom of my heart for saving me $5,000.

He's just gotten creepy instead. He walks around at night try to look in peoples' windows. There's no street lights here so you can't see him until he's pressed up against the window. He seems obsessed with the whole no air conditioning thing. He's calling CPS on people because of it. 

Everyone calls the cops when he looks in their windows but that doesn't seem to discourage but at least there's a record of it.

A man who used to live in my neighborhood has sued me 12 separate times because I'm a witch, having filed in many different jurisdictions.

The first 11 times he sued it was dismissed and he had to pay costs. I was served again yesterday. It's to the point where no lawyer where I live will take me on as a client because he never pays the costs so it's not worth their time. He is jobless as far as I know. So not only do I have to travel to a different town to get a lawyer but I have also lost over 30 days of pay because of all the times I've had to miss work to go to court or go see my lawyer. I have a restraining order against him and like I said he had never contacted me but lawsuits are not included in the order (I tried but this is a violation of his rights apparently).

legalthrowaway9023,2016-02-11 15:58:44+00:00,[Update] I have been repeatedly assaulted at school and finally got fed up today and called the police. The administration sent me to the nurses office and refused to let me speak to the officer or call my mom.,"[Hi guys! I made this post about a month ago and a lot of people asked me to update, so here I am.](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/41phjq/fl_i_have_been_repeatedly_assaulted_at_school_and/)

First of all, I would like to apologize because I was severely overreacting when I made my post and I wasn't acting in a mature or calm manner. At the time, I was desperate for help and freaking out and I didn't have all the facts about the situation. Second of all, I'd like to say that I am not a troll. I got a few angry messages from people about my post and it took a lot of effort to ignore them. I overreacted, but that doesn't make me a bad person. Thanks to everyone who took their time to even talk to me because replying to your messages helped me calm down.

Now on to the actual update and hopefully this will clear things up...

* I made my post because my skirt had been cut into ribbons and I was being forced to go back to class instead of being allowed to stay in the nurse's office until my mom came to get me. I didn't know this at the time, but only my dad is listed as my emergency contact and the nurse was trying to contact him on the phone (we don't know why my mom's contact form was missing from my file and that was a big issue with my parents because my mom should have been #1 on my contact list). My dad's office doesn't have good reception so the calls kept going straight to voicemail. The administration never told me that they were trying to contact my dad so I kept panicking and freaking out thinking that they weren't doing anything to help. 

* My attacker was suspended for 3 days for cutting my skirt and was back in class the next week. I was suspended for a week for making the call to the police officer. We aren't allowed to use phones in school and that is the justification the school used for suspending me. It doesn't really matter because my parents have decided to let me finish high school online, but I am upset that I received a longer suspension than my attacker. 

* My parents and I went down to the police station and filed a report against my attacker for assaulting me. Since we are both juveniles we don't think it will go anywhere, but the report has been for the record.

* The school never made a formal announcement, but the male admin who sent me back to class with the ripped skirt has been missing from the hallways since the Monday following the incident and no one has seen him since. Rumor mill is that he was fired, but no one can confirm or deny for sure. 

* Photos of me did end up on snapchat thanks to a few asshole classmates. Not sure what I can do about that so I'm trying to ignore it and move on.

* Two of my classmates are also leaving this school because my attacker tried to pull a similar stunt with them so apparently it's still an issue at the school, but I've washed my hands of the situation because nothing I've done has seemed to have an effect. The school only less than 200 students K-12 so I'm not sure why they would rather lose three students than the one jackass who causes problems, but I don't really care anymore.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/459g15/update_i_have_been_repeatedly_assaulted_at_school/,legaladvice,1262,2,
throwaway_stolencar,2016-02-11 14:26:16+00:00,My car was stolen. Police found a 16 year old driving it but say they can't charge him because there is not enough evidence. Thief is the son of a city councillor [California],"My car was stolen out of my driveway. I came out in the morning to find my car gone and some broken glass in the driveway. I called the police and filed a report.

Last week the police called me and told me the car had been found and said that I could come and pick it up. I picked it up from the police station but the clutch and the transmission were fried (it's a manual) and I had to get it towed back to my house because I couldn't drive it. The police told me they caught someone driving it and they were working on the case.

Besides the window being broken and the clutch and transmission being fried the car reeked of marijuana and had empty beer bottles all over the floor. While I was cleaning it I found a cell phone under the seat. It was unlocked and it had notifications up. I brought the phone to the police figuring that it would help their case. This is where it gets weird.

The officer took the phone but told me there wasn't enough evidence to charge anyone with anything so I should just cut my losses and move on. I didn't understand how this was possible because they told me they caught someone driving it and the report they sent to my insurance company confirms this.

I called the police again and kept getting the run around so finally I asked to speak to a supervising officer. The supervising officer told me they didn't have enough evidence on ""John Smith"" to charge him with anything. I don't think it's a coincidence that ""John Smith"" is the son of a city councillor. The supervising officer told me that the case was closed and I should leave this alone.

Is there anything I can do to get them to charge him? He was found driving my car that I have on video being stolen. His phone was found in my car, the window was busted, the transmission and clutch were fried, the car smells like marijuana and had 36 beer bottles on the floor. The bill to fix my car is going to be a fortune. I know that if he wasn't the son of a city councillor he would already be in jail. Also despite having a clean driving record and no criminal record I have been pulled over 4 times since I got my car back while driving my rental. All 4 times it was just so the police could ""check my documents"". A strange guy in a suit also came to my house and has sat in a car outside my work. He never says anything to me he just smilies and waves. The police say he isn't breaking any laws by being in public.

What can I do about this? Can I talk to the state police or the FBI if the local police won't help?

Is this legal?,"I work for a small business (about 40 employees including the owner) and he decided about a month ago to start his own political charity that he could use to donate to political candidates and causes of his choice. He is requiring every employee to donate 5% of their after-tax paycheck from now on to his charity. He is also requiring that every employee sign a form that agrees to this ""voluntary"" donation to his charity. He announced it in a company-wide meeting last month to fire anyone who refused and gave everyone a month to sign it and return it to him. 2 people refused to sign it and were fired yesterday on the last day to return the form. 1 of them has been there over 10 years and was probably the best employee the owner has.

I'm on vacation this week, so I have to return the form on Monday. I don't subscribe to his political beliefs, nor do I support his preferred presidential candidate.

So I know the original post didn't get a lot of attention but the situation completely changed after my post and I know you guys love a good juicy neighbor story. I had my roommate move both our cars the other night  and just waited at my window for a bit around the time I suspected the theft was happening and sure enough around midnight my neighbor across the street walks up with TWO ten gallon buckets. So I took a couple pictures out of my window. At this point he sees the spigots were locked and he went back in the house. He comes out less than a minute later with a tool box and tries to get the lock off for a bit (i took a few more pictures) but he failed. So then he just walks over to my other neighbors house and uses their spigot! And not only that he came back and filled the buckets up went inside and then came back out and filled them up again two more times. So I'm not exactly sure what transpired but last night I heard a ton of yelling and a gun shot which isn't an uncommon occurrence in this neighborhood so the cops got here pretty fast. Turns out neighbors were growing a ton of pot in their trailer(triple wide mobile home) and didn't want to fund the water bill I guess? They were using it for all their household stuff too and there was like three of them living in there.  Cops took everyone away, don't have to worry about them anymore!

Anyways rental company lady, she actually lives up the street from me and came when she saw the cops, said not to worry about paying rent(water and gas is read off a meter then added to my rent) until they get it sorted out and I won't have to pay the full amount so I will be okay and able to afford stuff this month! Yay!! I guess I'm one of five other people on my street complaining of huge water bills and so I showed her the pictures and I guess this is not even close to the first problem they've had with these neighbors surprise surprise 


I did end up making all my bathroom fixtures super water efficient in the meantime thanks to suggestions on the last post though so thank you guys :P",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/43us49/update_someone_started_stealing_my_water_caught_em/,legaladvice,1322,208,

legalthrowaway1911,2016-01-24 02:22:19+00:00,[North Dakota] My 22 year old brother was arrested for statutory rape for sleeping with a 17 year old. She was his bartender. The minimum age for serving alcohol in ND is 19.,"Throwaway for obvious reasons. My 22 year old brother has been arrested for statutory rape because he slept  with a 17 year old. The age of consent in ND is 18 and there is no close in age exception or anything like that. He met the 17 year old at a bar where she was the bartender. In North Dakota the legal age for serving alcohol is 19 years old. The bar he met her at was a real sports bar and not some dive.

My brother is not a creep or a pervert and he wouldn't have slept with her if he had known her age. I went to the sports bar with him one time. She looks like she is in her 20s and she even has several tattoos. Never in his wildest dreams would we have thought she was only 17. Can he use the fact that she was working as a bartender as a defense? Getting convicted of something like this could screw up his future. I got him a lawyer but I haven't had a chance to talk with the lawyer yet and I'm really afraid for my brother right now.

EDIT: Wow this really blew up. Apologies to everyone for not replying sooner, there was an emergency at work I needed to deal with. I will reply in to the questions people posted as well, but I will say that; my brother worked as a waiter and bartender in his last 2 years of college so he knows the law around serving alcohol, that we both saw her smoking cigarettes, that she was behind the bar serving and mixing drinks on more than one occasion when he was there or I was there with him, that from what I know her cousin was the one who called the police and that I when I said I had not had a chance to speak with his lawyer I meant beyond retaining him quickly so he could get down there and start looking after my brother.

legalthrowaway9023,2016-01-19 16:48:43+00:00,[FL] I have been repeatedly assaulted at school and finally got fed up today and called the police. The administration sent me to the nurses office and refused to let me speak to the officer or call my mom.,"**Update: People are asking, so here's a quick update. My mom came to the school and was super super pissed off. They didn't know which bathroom I was in so mom had to text me to find out, which made her more angry at the school for not even knowing where I was. When she saw my skirt, she got really quiet and called my aunt to come take me home and she's still at the school dealing with it. Aunt and I just got back from getting some food. I'll let you all know how it pans out.**

Throwaway since my parents know I reddit. I snuck to the bathroom on my phone to post this.

I am a 16 year old female student who attends a private Catholic high school in NW Florida. Right after Thanksgiving, my school accepted a new transfer student and put him in a few of my classes. Ever since then, he hasn't left me alone and it has escalated to the point where he held me down and tried to kiss me during gym class last week. I reported this to my teacher but was basically told that I should be nice to the new student and let it go :/

Today during homeroom, I was walking to my desk and he cut my uniform skirt with a pair of scissors as I walked past him. I freaked out and started crying and ran to the bathroom because you could see my panties through the hole in my skirt and I didn't have another change of clothes except my gym uniform. 

One of the administrators found me crying in the bathroom and called me into her office to discuss what happened. I thought that I was safe, but he was sitting in a chair waiting for us! I refused to go into the room and demanded that my mom be called and eventually the secretary took me to the nurses' office. I kept demanding that my mom be called but they were just trying to calm me down (and trying their best not to call my mom). I got fed up with them and I decided to just dial 911 from my iPhone. 

30 minutes go by and I realize that no one was coming to get me to speak to the officer. One of the admins came back and told me that my 'little stunt' wasn't going to work and that I was going to get detention. I then dialed my mom on my phone right in front of the admin and told her what happened. She freaked out and is on her way to come get me (she works about 45 mins away).

About 30 minutes after I called my mom, I was sent back to class. I snuck out to the bathroom to post this, but I wanted to verify that what the school did to me was illegal. As far as I know the other student is in his math class right now (texted a friend who confirmed it) and I am still sitting in a ripped skirt with my panties visible. I was never even taken to get my gym clothes and I was sent back to class dressed like this.


What they did was illegal, right? They can't just blame me for being attacked can they? Please help because I am freaking out :((((

darrence84,2016-01-14 20:10:19+00:00,"Update | [Florida] Realtors keep driving onto my property to show a plot of land for sale, they claim this is legal to do.","First, [here's my original post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/3x7p30/florida_realtors_have_shown_up_on_my_property/)

And second, [here's my professionally drawn map of the property in question.](https://i.imgur.com/Vfsnkhg.png)

Lastly, thanks for your patience. A lot happened and I didn't want to ruin anything that was in the process of unfolding.

-----

I'm going to cut out a big chunk of what happened because it's not super relevant and I don't want to waste time. The gist is: the easement to the property in question is NOT on my property, but there WAS an easement there in 1986, however it was relocated when the property was surveyed and rezoned that year. 

Fast forward, I went to the realty office and spoke with the owner of the company. He was pretty douchey - bald, short, fat, wore thick gold chain and a huge watch. Almost like he watched 80s movies and picks up fashion advice from the villains. 

Anyway, he told me the owner of the property is very motivated to sell the land and that I should just buy it to get rid of the headache. The words he used and the way he said them immediately tipped me off that he was the one telling his realtors to pester me and go through my property and if I spoke up about it, I should just buy it myself. So of course I wasn't going to do that.

I told him that my gate is now locked to all trespassers, and that if he's lucky, I'll only call the cops when I see any of his employees on my property again. I regret saying that, but I was so frustrated with this guy, you don't even know...

So for the next week or so, I saw maybe two cars pull into my driveway, get to the gate, get on their cell phones then drive away. 

The next week was Christmas and I got a visitor. It was the son of the guy that owned the property, visiting from out of state. His dad (the original owner) had died a few years back, and he was now looking to sell it because he doesn't want to pay the taxes and/or do anything with it. Apparently, someone at the realty office told him of what was happening and he wanted to come straighten everything out. He was extremely nice and apologized profusely. I ended up taking him to a bar (this was actually a few days before Christmas, don't want to send the saddest image possible of two older guys drinking alone in a bar on Christmas). Learned a lot about his dad taking him hunting and camping on that property when he was a kid. It was really nice. 

So the property is about 80 acres in total, appraised at $280,000, but listed at $200,000. I told him I'd love to buy it and just keep it the way it is, maybe fence it off and add cattle to it, and his eyes lit up. I told him I don't have $200k sitting around and that I wouldn't feel right low-balling him. He kept pressuring me for a number, but I just couldn't come up with one that seemed fair.

Fast forward again, January 2nd. I get a phone call from the guy, asking if anyone has come to see the property in a while. I had almost forgot that the realtors used to pester me, and I was happy to report I hadn't seen any since we last spoke. He told me he took the listing off the market and dropped that realty company. He asked me again for a number, and I told him $100,000 was the highest I could see myself going. He said ""sold!""

So a few days later, he showed up again with his lawyer, we signed some documents, I wrote a check, we went back to that bar to celebrate, and my farm just got 80 acres larger.

whtshpnin,2016-01-14 15:15:55+00:00,Update: I'm a foreign student at an American Uni. I've been served a restraining order. I've never interacted with the person I'm supposed to stay away from.,"I just thought you folks would appreciate an update to [this post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/3x8syq/im_a_foreign_student_at_an_american_uni_ive_been/) This is a California university.

TL;DR: I hired a lawyer, she investigated. Young lady who filed for the TRO withdrew the application, I didn't even need to go to the court. 

The whole story- 

It's a little long and a little complicated so I'll lead with a few facts. I'm 27, I moved here in September for my masters. I'm also taking an undergrad course at the suggestion of my advisor to shore up my fundamentals before I get deeper into my grad program. I lived in a 3bhk with two other guys (lets call them Nick and Aiden), I found this accommodation on the university FB. They're both seniors in an undergrad course.

The young lady (lets call her Angie) who filed the TRO is Nicks' ex-girlfriend, they broke up before I came to this country so I had no awareness of this. It seems like Nick had been having a hard time getting over this relationship and November onwards he had gone off the deep end. He had been stalking Angie and had been harassing some of her friends. He ended up crossing the line in December, talked his way into her house when she wasn't there and stole some of her stuff claiming they were gifts from him. Aiden also contributed to this harassment by driving Nick around (Aiden is the only one the house with a car) as well trying to get Angie to talk to Nick a few too many times. 

My knowledge of this whole drama was absolutely nil, my relations with the 2 guys is restricted to house stuff. There's not much in common between two 21 year old American seniors and a 27 year old Indian grad student. We were acquaintances who were happy to stay that way. Unfortunately for me, Angie was not aware of this dynamic.

The day after Nick stole her stuff, Angie went to the police, following their advice she filed a TRO against Nick, Aiden, another one of their friends and me. I was included in that sordid list for a few reasons-

* I was their housemate, and it was reasonable to suspect that I knew about this whole drama. 

* A couple of people claimed to have seen me in their company often. Other than the grocery store, and a bar on my first weekend here, I have never hung out with these guys in any way. But the chinese whispers that started during the whole drama blew up my role to false proportions.

* Among his various harassing messages, Nick would always know where Angie was and who she was with. How much of that he knew through his own stalking and how much he knew through other people is unknown. I was suspected of being one of those other people. Angie seems to have suspected that I was taking that class we shared to keep an eye on her for Nick, me a grad student being in an undergrad class was the basis of that suspicion.

All of these reasons were enough for Angie to include me in that list, the judge and university official didn't give a damn about me and granted the TRO.

As I mentioned in my first post, I went to the legal aid office. They couldn't help me since this was a student v student issue but they put me in touch with with an outside lawyer. This lady had a lot of experience with restraining orders wrt to students and after meeting me and doing some preliminary investigations agreed to take on my case. She talked to everyone involved including Nick, Aiden and Angie through her Lawyer. Nick and Aiden told her about my non-involvement, my advisor and a few of my professors also helped out. 

Once the whole story came out, Angie applied to withdraw the TRO filed against me. All of this was done by last week, thank god.

My life has been fairly up in the air since this whole clusterfuck. Its cost me a lot of money, lawyer fees and moving into a new place is fairly expensive. I had to borrow some of this money from my parents who have been losing their mind from halfway around the world. Also when the TRO was filed the University had to inform my scholarship granters, and they started a review of my scholarship. My lawyer has updated them of the details including statements from Angie and my advisor, but the review is a long process and will take its own time so I'm still a little worried. Also I won't be taking the follow up undergrad course I was planning on, there are multiple reasons for that but this issue has contributed a little bit.

I admit I was a little annoyed with Angie though I fully understood the reasons. Thankfully she had the good grace of apologising to me publicly on her FB and the class bulletin board. I'm very thankful to her for that since I was a little worried about the social repercussions. 

As for Nick and Aiden they will be having a hard time, both have been expelled from the university. Nick is also charged with grand theft (dumbfuck stole all her electronics and some really expensive sneakers). Fortunately they're both out of my lives.


I'd like to thank you guys for the personalised advice. Your explanations and advice certainly helped in calming me down and stopped me from losing my mind.

The biological father has been making $X child support payments every 2 weeks and when this all happened he told me he would continue to provide the same support.  Edit: I should stress he has ZERO interest in taking the children and 100% interest in continuing to make the same payments he made before - He is as good as a parent as he can be by writing a check each month.

My issue with this is my household income has now been cut in half (actually more like 60%) but almost all expenses remain the same (mortgage, utilities, etc).

He thinks that the social security benefits the kids will receive from their mothers passing should offset child support he owes (and maybe he is right?)

The reality for me is that if I wanted to, I could simply put the kids on a plane - fly them out to their biological dad and be done with them.  I love them and have raised the the past 12 years so that isn't a realistic idea.  However I do feel that he needs to shoulder more of the burden due to the mothers passing.  After all, if I did send the kids to him he would be responsible for 100% of their costs.

I have a probate attorney to help me with some legal stuff but the costs are adding up ridiculously quickly to the point where I already think I'm just going to have to file for bankruptcy.

Any advice or guidance would be greatly appreciated.  I find all kinds of information on the internet when it comes to step parents and divorce but not a step parent in the case of a biological parents death.

Do I base support off of 3/4 of my cost (me + 3 kids) or 3/5s cost? (Myself, what my wifes contribution would have been and then the 3 kids)?

So lost...

Edit: I think my housing is actually the least of my worries.  I have at least $100k (loan paid down + appreciation) of equity in a house that has appreciation of 10-15% per year due to a good real estate market. On top of that I plan on using some of the life insurance money (not much) available to re-fi my house to lower payments (would probably cut the payments in half). It would be a detriment for me to sell the house at this point.   ",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/3zavi8/usa_nevada_wife_passed_and_leaves_3_children/,legaladvice,1131,97,
scareddanceteacher,2015-12-30 17:27:06+00:00,UPDATE: Student's mother found out I was abused as a teen and is now telling everyone I'm a danger to the kids. I might lose my job. [NY],"[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/3y3b7m/students_mother_found_out_i_was_abused_as_a_teen/)

Let me start by thanking everyone who took the time to give me advice and answer my questions in the previous post. That was a very helpful starting point. There were a few requests for updates so here we go. 

Many of you suggested that I contact an attorney to write her a letter, which is exactly what I did. He said if I *really* wanted to pursue this with a lawsuit, I might be able to. But to be honest, I'd much rather not spend the time and resources if I don't have to, especially since my last court experience was less than great. I'm not looking for a big payout. I just want to move forward with my life. 
 
I asked my boss if we could set up a time to meet since we're technically closed this week. I knew she was aware of the situation since this woman had posted on our facebook page which my boss manages, but I wasn't really sure where my boss stood on the issue, so I was pretty anxious going in. I told my boss about my visit with the lawyer and about the letter he was going to send her. Turns out, she had a lawyer friend of hers do the exact same thing on behalf of the business. So this woman got not one, but two letters ordering her to shut the hell up, from two different lawyers. Hopefully that is enough to scare her into keeping her mouth shut. 

She told me to just avoid this lady at all costs. Like if I run into her at the grocery store, turn around. Her daughter is still taking classes with another teacher during a time when I'm not working. She said she knows this woman is batshit crazy and if she thought there was any real concern regarding me being around kids she would have fired me. She also said she thinks I've been doing a great job handling this and that overall the kids and parents respond really well to me and she's glad to have me on her staff. Always nice to hear and at this point it looks like my job is not in jeopardy. 

The facebook posts have been deleted. Not sure if Facebook did it after I reported them, or if she did it herself. Hopefully this is the last you'll be hearing from me. Big thanks to the community for your wise advice and kind words.

dude-wheres-my-car,2015-12-28 19:40:03+00:00,UPDATE: Car was mistakenly towed from my own parking spot and tow company won't release my car without paying huge storage fees,"WASHINGTON

Original post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/3x45v9/car_was_mistakenly_towed_from_my_own_parking_spot/).

I grudgingly paid the $1000 and picked up my car that day.

I filed suit in small claims court against the business and owner before Christmas. This morning I served him at his office. Actually, my neighbor's home-from-college daughter served him. She was surprisingly smooth doing it. I was ""standing in line"" behind her when she did it. The owner didn't know me as it was a different employee who was at the office when I was last there. I explained why I was suing him and he was either really annoyed or didn't seem to care much. It was hard to tell. Before leaving, I handed him a letter from our Condo Board (of which I am a member) informing that when his contract expires at the end of February, it was not going to be renewed. It was surprisingly easy to convince my fellow board members to not renew his contract as they have heard similar complaints from other owners and guests.

About an hour ago, he called me (from the number on my original request to tow) to tell me that his employee ""mistakenly"" charged me the storage fees and should have just given me my car. That was a lie because the manager/employee called the owner when I was originally there and asked him, and it was the owner himself who told him to waive the tow fees but still charge the storage fees. I told him as much. He said his employee must have ""misunderstood"" and apologized, which I believed not at all.

He offered to refund the money if I agreed to renew his contract with the property. I said that this was not going to be a *quid pro quo* and that he should do what he thought was right. I told him that if he refunded the ~$1000 PLUS the filing fee, that I would drop the lawsuit. If he didn't, I would let the court decide. As to his contract, I said that we were meeting officially next week to discuss new tow contracts, and that his company would be free to offer his services again. I did not tell tell him that there was no way that we were going to give him another contract.

Here are my questions for this mini-update:

1. If the owner gives me back the money (including the filing fee), have I actually agreed to give his company back the contract with our property?

2. If he doesn't and I end up going to court, what sort of evidence should I bring with me?

3. Is there any sort of implied extortion by offering to drop the lawsuit if he paid the money (and fee) and telling him that his contract wasn't being renewed and that the board was meeting to find a new company, but that he could resubmit if he liked?

**TL;DR** - Served small claims suit on tow company. Told them their tow contract would not be renewed with property. They offered to return the money if we renewed their contract.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/3yk50f/update_car_was_mistakenly_towed_from_my_own/,legaladvice,1277,110,
dinosaurssideways,2015-12-27 13:28:11+00:00,Foo Fighters poster plagiarism,"I don't think this is quite the right place but hopefully someone can point me in the right direction 

My friend (A) has just discovered that someone has stolen/copied a photo of her work and sold it to the Foo Fighters who are using it as one of their poster designs. Not only is it her work, but it is actually of herself. She does not want her likeness to be used in this way - she never gave her permission.

She contacted the artist directly who has replied something along the lines of 'oh I can't remember where I saw it maybe I accidentally adapted a photo of yours I found through Tinder last year. Please don't get angry I normally ask permission of an artist when I draw them. Can I send you some posters'. With a side by side comparison they are identical. The original image was created by her 4 years ago and all that proof is available timestamped etc.

It's ridiculous that he has offered free posters as some kind of apology. Who do we contact/how? He's deleting all our comments on his own Instagram. I've tried tweeting the Foo Fighters but it's obviously the holiday time of year so unlikely to get a response through that.

She isn't looking to sue for compensation. But her face is literally out there on a Foo Fighters poster without her permission. Who do we contact &amp; how to get acknowledgment of this, an apology, and all the images removed as far as they can be from use/the public domain?

Any advice would be appreciated - as well as where else to post this.

Edit as this seems to be relevant:

She currently lives in Asia.

The plagiarist appears to live in Europe.

Foo Fighters are presumably based in the US?

Nb. She isn't mad at the Foos. Just doesn't want her face on their posters

Edit again: Woah! Woke up to this having taken off! We will go through all the comments later  today but thank you so much everyone for taking the time to offer your help! And just to clarify - this isn't directed at the Foo Fighters. It's about the other artist and how to get him to acknowledge/understand that ripping other people off for his own profit isn't something he can do. Us speaking to him directly hasn't worked and we wanted to know how else to contact him to get this message through - and it seems like through the band's marketing team is the best bet. I'm going to check with her about linking the side-by-side comparison but it's 8am here and I have to dash to work. Thanks again!

Edit again again: http://imgur.com/g3YEhBB here is the side by side. She is on the left, poster in the right. I'm in a meeting now but she's going to make her own account to reply to comments etc. Thanks again everybody :)

I gave her written notice last night like everyone suggested and then left her alone. I talked to her mother and told her what happened. She called me this morning and said she was coming over. She walked in and started packing her stuff pretty much straight away. The whole time my ex was literally just crying and stomping around like a child. I have never seen her look that defeated before. After everything that's happened I thought it would be satisfying to see her like that but it was actually really sad. After grabbing some of her stuff, her mom dragged her out the door and that was it. Ten minutes, in and out. Fairly anticlimactic really. I assume that she will come by another time to get the rest of her stuff. I've always really liked her mom. She's a no-nonsense type of woman. 

Her mom apologized on her behalf, but I still haven't received any sort of heartfelt apology from her unfortunately. I am glad that she's gone, but it's pretty sad that I'm going to have to spend Christmas alone. 

I think the eviction notice was the main reason her mother came over, so Thanks /r/legaladvice!",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/3y49t7/update_my_girlfriend_cheated_on_me_but_is_now/,legaladvice,1462,237,

I am going to keep this brief as I am at work:

* Honda legal did show up
* I presented my case
*  Honda guy (as suspected) argued that this needs to be handled via arbitration, I present my copy of the arbitration agreement to the Judge.
* Judge asks Honda guy if he has the same copy, he does, he then says any signature on the page = acknowledgement and agreement, irrespective of the handwritten note saying I do not agree.
* Honda guy goes on to say that their finance guy was not authorized to agree to this, therefore the agreement is valid.
* For several minutes the Judge lays into the Honda guy about upholding a level of professionalism among legal representatives, that his argument is ""a bunch of hooey"" and he knows it...other things were said but the long and the short of it is that the Judge kicked this guy's ass up and down the courtroom.  
* Judge asks if Honda guy is ready to actually defend the case, he is
*  Honda guy has no reasonable counter argument as to why I was sold an obviously previously damaged car 

I won, the other (better) dealership is going to do the repair work, the original dealership will pay for that, and I am going to get a couple of bucks for the devaluation of the car (since it has a CARFAX report against it)...keeping that part vague on purpose...let's just say that I am happy.

darrence84,2015-12-17 13:45:59+00:00,"[Florida] Realtors have shown up on my property several times to show a plot of land that is for sale. The plot of land does not have road access, so the realtors are just coming down my driveway, walking across my property, to show the land to buyers. They say its legal.","I'll try to be brief.

There is a big plot of land recently put up for sale that is nicely priced, so it's had quite a few people interested in buying it. Problem is, it is surrounded by a subdivision on 2 sides, a wildlife refuge on another side, and my farm on the 4th side.

Access to this property is through this small gap between my farm and a subdivision (somewhat in the corner). It is a dense forest however - no road at all - as no one has cared for this property in 40 years.

So now I have realtors that have begun driving up my *clearly* marked private driveway, with clients, parking on my lawn, and walking 300 feet across my property to go show this plot of land. 

At first, I tried to be nice and explain the situation. My driveway is quite long, listed as a street (3872 N street name), and dead ends right at my house. It might be confusing and I don't want to be rude. So I told them that if they *really* wanted to show the land, just give me a call so I know ahead of time. Well, this worked once, and now they've taken to just randomly driving up again. 

So I got stern and told them (the realty company and the agents that have shown up) that this is my property and they are trespassing. They are not allowed to use my driveway to show this property and my land does not feature any access to the plot of land for sale. If they so choose, they should go up the road to that little gap where a road *should* be and walk through the forest. Even the MLS listing has that road as the address.

They have told me that legally, they are allowed to do what they are doing and that if I want it to stop, maybe **I** should buy the land myself. I also noticed that the address to this plot of land is now listed as 3874 N [my street name], making it seem like my private driveway is the access point.

So I don't really know what to do. I installed a gate at the end of my road, which has increased the number of calls I'm now getting. But are these realtors right? I've called a few law offices around town and none of them can give me a good answer (none have any experience in this). So it looks like I'll be needing to speak with a lawyer in a bigger city, I suppose.

Thank you all.

**EDIT 2**: I'm going to go to the county clerk's office later today and confirm everything. Even if it means just understanding my own property a little better, it's worth it. I'll also be stopping by the realty office shortly after.

I didn't end up contacting a lawyer on my own and ended up just going through the NLRB, but they were pretty awesome about the whole thing.  I definitely felt like they had my back the whole time and they were very helpful and professional.

I got back pay plus interest, the company has to post a notice telling everyone they were wrong and that they're allowed to talk about pay, and they had to offer me my position back (which I declined).

The secretary responded saying that they look thin and that she's never seen them buy lunch. 

I mentioned that I pack their lunches.  The vice principal sits with a different class each Monday and has lunch with them. So she knows the kids and what they eat. She told they secretary that she has personally seen them eat lunch.

The secretary then brought up that she didn't see me apply sunscreen on Sports Day. The vice principal told her that a child's stepmom not wearing sunscreen has nothing to do with parenting. She warned the secretary about making false reports and sent her back to her desk.

She told me that if the secretary cause any other problems to come to her immediately but she doesn't think it should be an issue but she'll be speaking to CPS about the false reports since the secretary had harassed another family with them previously due to the family being vegetarians.

So I didn't show up for the date. I work in a store that sells watches and other high end jewellery, so this wasn't a business lunch type of situation. Also I am 23 and the customer is 46. The date was supposed to be at his house, just the two of us. The customer actually came to my place when I didn't show up because my boss gave him my address. I didn't open the door but he wouldn't leave even though I asked him to 3 times and I had to call the police. They came and told him to leave but the next day I got flowers and a not from him asking for a second chance at a date. He also phoned me more than once. I had to go to court and get a restraining order, he was really surprised it got granted but the judge was not happy with him. The police were on my side and one of them thinks he (the customer) thought his money would get him out of it. Luckily he has stopped, left me alone and not contacted me since the order came down.

My boss did fire me. He also said I was fired for misconduct so I can't get unemployment. I am talking with a lawyer and can't say more at this time. Just wanted to give everyone an update because people were so supportive.

I'm legally blind and carry a white cane at all times. A couple days ago, I was in a locally-owned store alone while my SO was at work. I'm pretty sure I was the only customer in there at the time. As I was going through the store, a woman who identified herself as the owner came up to and said that I can't use my cane in her store because she couldn't stand the scraping sound that the metal tip made on the tile floor. I explained that I am disabled and need this cane to navigate, but she shouted that the sound of my cane on the floor was going to give her a headache and that I need to be quiet or leave. Since I figured she was being an idiot, I said ""Yeah, OK, whatever,"" and pretty much blew her off, which probably wasn't smart.

As I turned away from her, cane a-scraping, she took another step in, grabbed my cane out of my hand, and threw it toward the door about 30 feet away. In the process, she bumped into me, and the whole event disoriented me enough that I fell down (but not into anything and the fall didn't injure me in any way). I got back up and tried to grope my way around the tables toward the door to find my cane, with this lady yelling ""get the fuck out of my store,"" and ""warmer!"" and ""colder!"" at me the whole time. When I finally found my cane on the sidewalk, she yelled across the store that if I ever came back in, she'd have me arrested for assault (?!), I should ""take [my] crying ass home"" (the shock and humiliation of the whole event had me tearing up; not my proudest moment as a 30-year-old guy), and that she bets I never come in to annoy her anymore.

The rest and surrounding area is very heavily wooded with very high trees. My daughter's friend came over, and the friend brought one of her chihuahuas. (My daughter and her friend are both 10 if that matters.) 

They were in the backyard playing with the dog, but they both came inside to get something to eat, leaving the dog in the backyard. Apparently a falcon took the opportunity to swoop down, pick up the dog, and fly away. I didn't see this, but my daughter and her friend both saw the bird swoop down through the window. I hear screaming, come running, and the dog is gone. 

I run into the backyard and can't find anything. We looked around in the woods around the house for a while but couldn't find anything. The dog was gone. 

The poor girl is understandably upset, so I walk her home so I can talk to her parents and tell them what happened. The mom *lost her shit*, which, again, is understandable, but this was the craziest thing I had ever seen. She started rolling on the ground and making these wild, incoherent noises while their 5-6 other chihuahuas were jumping all over her, howling and barking. I thought I was going to have to dial 911. Then she jumped up and started smacking her daughter on the head, screaming at her about how she knew she wasn't allowed to leave the dog unattended outside because of the coyotes and hawks and eagles. She proceeded to scream at me how I could've let the dog play in the backyard. I said I was sorry for their loss, and I went home. 

A couple days later (today) the husband knocks on my door and demands $10,000 for the dog. I actually laughed at that, which pissed him off. Apparently the mom and dad showed the dog in dog shows and studded him out for $1,000 a pop. 

I basically told the guy to sue me, and he said I would be sorry, and he stormed off. If they do try to sue, is there a case here for them? I haven't told my home insurance policy about this yet. Should I tell them now or should I wait until he does something? 

TL:DR A hawk took a prize chihuahua while it was visiting my property. Should I worry?

Tiresquire,2015-10-12 17:22:39+00:00,Someone parked in my driveway for a festival. I had them towed. They hit my car. They now want to sue me.,"I live in a downtown area and have behind my house parking. Street, public parking is in front of the house. You have to pull down an alley way and park behind my house in order to park in my driveway. I came home to someone parked in that spot. 

It is obviously not public parking. It is behind my house, right next to my doorway. Not even close to the street. 

I don't own the house. I rent. I contacted my landlord after waiting about an hour hoping the owner of said vehicle would just move it. The festival is an all day thing and it was getting late and I needed to move my car from pay parking a few blocks over before I incurred the all day fee.  When I had waited an hour, I contact my landlord who is out of town. 

He told me to wait another hour and then call this guy he knows and have it towed. 

I walk to the festival and ask one of the stage hands (?) or presenters or whatever if they could make an announcement about moving a car. I gave the license plate number and they made the announcement. Nothing.  

At this point, I've waited nearly four hours. I need to move my car into my spot. There is no street parking because of the festival. I can't park at a neighbors because they are hosting people and have a full driveway. 

So I contact the tow truck. 

He comes and tows the truck. Gives me some information. I attach a note to my car for the owners should they arrive back to see their car about how and where they can find their car. I then go inside to sleep.

I wake up to the sound of someone banging on my door. It is the owner. He is angry. I give him the information, explain the situation. He blames me, the city, my landlord, every person but himself. 

I tell him basically sorry but you really shouldn't have parked in someone's driveway. I gave you four hours to come back to your car. You should have known something was going to happen. 

"" The house looked abandoned"" "" I didn't know this wasn't public parking""  "" Why don't you have signs?""

As he is leaving, he hits my car a few times and kicks the bumper. 

There is a very small dent from his kicks but nothing major. I figure they have learned their lesson and will not park in people's driveways next time. 

Today I got a notice that they were suing me in small claims for the cost of the tow fees plus extra for the ride they had to get to the tow place. They waited four days to go get their car. Not my landlord, me. 

I am assuming they got my information and name from the tow paperwork. 


I am not sure what to do from here. I can file a response but what do I say. Do I ask for a dismissal and/or state my case? Do I go to court? Do I request a statement from my landlord? 

This is in Arkansas.

cantheyreallydothis,2015-10-01 03:36:17+00:00,"UPDATE: Company car I was driving was hit by a drunk driver. Insurance fully paid for the car but the company says I still owe them $40,000 [CA]","Original post [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/3hwt4a/company_car_i_was_driving_was_hit_by_a_drunk/) The tl;dr version is that I was almost killed by a drunk driver while I was driving a company car. His insurance paid the blue book value ($40,000) to the company but I was sent to collections and told that I owed them $40,000 for the car because I didn't return it to them in the condition which they gave it to me. 

No one at the company or the collections agency would help me and they just sent me back and forth (company told me to talk to collections, collections told me to talk to the company) so I ended up getting a lawyer because the stress of being hounded by collections was setting back my recovery.

The lawyer sent a very strongly worded letter to someone high up that I couldn't reach myself because I kept getting the run around. That person didn't know anything about it and the company launched an investigation. The three people who kept giving me the run around ended up being charged with fraud and a bunch of other stuff. I don't know much but the police say they have emails and they think the 3 were planning on keeping the payment for themselves since the company was already paid. They are also in trouble for fraudulently using company resources to send me to collections for a fake debt.

Afterward my company wrote me a letter of apology. They paid the costs for my lawyer and made sure the debt was removed from my record. They also made a donation to a charity of my choice. I am nearly ready to return to work but they told me to take as much time as I need. After talking with the police I believe the higher ups were not aware because the police say the 3 were trying to keep it a secret. The drunk driver’s insurance is paying all my bills related to the incident so I won’t have debt from this ever.

All in all I am doing much better. I would like to thank /r/legaladvice and everyone who offered advice and encouragement and sent me supportive messages.

Lots of mention of big fines, damages, $100,000 cybersquatting charge, expensive legal action etc etc.

cantdrivetoleave,2015-09-25 18:32:30+00:00,[UPDATE] [FL] A private pre-school opened up across the street from my house and the parent traffic blocks me and my neighbors from exiting our driveways.,"[Original](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/3lyv7j/fl_a_private_preschool_opened_up_across_the/)

Hey guys! Thank you all so much for the advice and I am happy to report that we found a way to resolve the situation. /u/kaorte's [MS Paint drawing of the neighborhood](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/3lyv7j/fl_a_private_preschool_opened_up_across_the/cvbi7ec) was 100% on point.

Some of you asked why my neighbor felt that Stacy was being racially motivated and I didn't want to get into too much detail at the time because I didn't personally feel that way. My neighbors are black, I am Asian, and Stacy is white, but I don't believe that she was trying to do this because we are minorities; she would have done this to anyone regardless of race.

As suggested by numerous users, I decided to call the police when I got home from work and they said they would send an officer out to investigate (I didn't have a chance to file a zoning complaint). As I predicted, the traffic to my house was backed up and I was waiting to pull into my neighborhood (I had joined the line of cars). When the officer arrived, I flagged him down and explained to him about the long line of cars and how they were blocking the driveways. At this point, my neighbor (Alex) and his wife (Anna) came out of their house to also speak with the officer. The second neighbor (Louis) then came home and joined us.

The officer was not only concerned about us not having access to our driveways, he was also very concerned about the safety of any children crossing the street. He asked us to wait in my neighbor's yard while he walked over to speak with Stacy. After about 15 minutes, the officer and Stacy's oldest daughter (Laura) walked over to speak with us (I had not met her until this point). Laura explained that her mother had had a stroke last year and that she was sometimes not in her right mind as a result (she brought over some of the medical documents and we believe her). Laura said that she had no idea that the parents had been blocking us because she had been so busy trying to manage the kids. She apologized and said that she would be revising the school policy and send an email out to all the parents to notify them that they cannot block our driveways (she BCC'd us on the email). She also let us know that they built the school in order to care for the overflow of children from their normal church daycare and that she never meant to cause any problems.

The officer suggested that if Anna wanted to be the crossing guard, that she could go to the station and ask to be named a volunteer deputy and become official. Anna started filing the paperwork yesterday and it should all be taken care of in a few weeks. In the meantime, the officer made a few phone calls and one of the older residents of a close neighborhood (an ex-officer) said that he would gladly fill the role of crossing guard while Anna got her paperwork straightened out. He is going to start on Monday.

My neighbors and I have decided that we will not report them for the zoning issue unless things escalate from this point. The station is aware that the pre-school is not properly zoned, but they are willing to turn a blind eye as long as the pre-school agrees to let Anna be the crossing guard. I do not see any harm in allowing the school to exist as long as I am not negatively affected and I am happy that we were able to find a compromise. Laura brought us each some cookies and snacks and apologized again. This might not be the satisfying update you all wanted, but we are all happy and the issue looks like it is resolved.

**Edit:** The solution of having Anna be the crossing guard was exactly what we wanted from the beginning. I know some of you would be upset about the zoning or the legal repercussions for Laura, but all of us neighbors are satisfied with the compromise we made. Anna is very religious and she is more than happy to help out with the school. I will explain to Laura about the dangers of the zoning issues and see if we can find a way to get her legitimized.

cantdrivetoleave,2015-09-22 18:40:47+00:00,[FL] A private pre-school opened up across the street from my house and the parent traffic blocks me and my neighbors from exiting our driveways.,"I purchased a home in Florida a few years ago on a street that dead-ends. The driveway to the house opens directly into the street. Across the street from my house, there was a large plot of undeveloped land. Last year, a woman (I will call her Stacy) purchased the land across the street and built a large house surrounded by several portable buildings. She lives in the house and uses the portable buildings as classrooms for a private pre-school, which opened this school year.

The neighbors (I have one on each side of my house) on this side of the street were never informed about the construction of the pre-school. When the school year started, I was greeted by a long line of cars (it is a two lane road with no turning lane) waiting to make the left turn into the pre-school that severely backed up traffic. I tried to pull out of my driveway and onto the street, but the cars refused to move (they are all in park with the parents waiting to drop off their kids) and I had to wait over 45 minutes to simply pull out of my own driveway. This also happens at the end of the school day.

My neighbors and I had a meeting and went over and asked Stacy if there was a way to help resolve the traffic problem. My neighbor's wife does not work and she said she would be willing to volunteer as a crossing guard because she loves kids. We thought that would be a great solution, but Stacy told us that a crossing guard would be unnecessary. We explained to her that the parents are blocking our driveways and are not leaving gaps in front of our driveways for us to leave. Stacy became very belligerent and asked us to leave.

I decided to purchase some signs that say ""Please do not block driveway"" and placed them on either side of my driveway on Sunday night. My neighbors did the same with their own signs. On Monday morning, I walked out to my car and my driveway was still being blocked by the parents waiting to drop off their kids. I waited for a few minutes, but after 5 minutes went by and the parents continuing to sit in their unmoving vehicles, I started to lay on my horn. Stacy must have heard me, because when I got home from work, someone had ripped my signs out of the ground and they were gone. I checked my security cameras and they have footage of Stacy destroying the signs.

My instinct is to call the police, but one of my neighbors believes that because it affects all three of us, that we might have to escalate this higher. What do you all think?

I am all on my own and I moved into my apartment and started this job at the beginning of September. I started the job on September 1st. I was supposed to be paid on the 15th for 2 weeks of work (September 1-14). In that time period I worked 96 hours. Yesterday instead of a paycheck my boss gave me gift certificates for the pizzeria instead. He says he can't afford to pay me money and I must have misunderstood when he hired me because he made it clear I would be paid in gift certificates instead of money. He never said anything like that to me. The pizzeria is independently owned so I have no one else to go to about this. I complained to him but he said that it's all legal because he paid me the full amount I would have gotten in money except with gift certificates and that if I keep complaining he will fire me and void the certificates. He also said he could have given me less because I am under 21 and the law lets him pay young people less. All the other people who work there are family of his and he pays them money. Is it legal that he is doing this? I never would have taken the job if I knew I wouldn't be paid in money.

Good Morning, guys. This is an uplifting update. 
 
First of all, I'd like to thank all of you guys for such an overwhelming response.I'm glad that there are people who would spend time from their busy life to help a random stranger on Internet. :) 
 
So, After reading all of advises here and carefully discussing this matter with my cousin, we made a nasty plan. Yesterday night that squatter girl went outside to grab some dinner with her bf. Me and my cousin carefully packed all of her stuffs in her three bag left in in our front porch and locked ourselves in house. We also looked over her stuffs from window to make sure no one steals it. 
 
Our wait was over after 2 hours when girl returned. She figured it out and started pounding at our door, yelling loudly to open door, you know typical squatter drama. We told her to go fuck off and we won't open the door. So, finally after 30 minutes of constant drama, she dared to call cops. I was nervous how it would turn out. 
 
Cops arrived. Fortunately these were different ones than previous night. First they listened to her side. Then they came to me. I explicitly told them that I was sole owner of house and never allowed girl to stay more than 1 night. She was not only trespassing but also living in my house illegally without my permission. Bitch kept saying I had given permission to stay there indefinitely and now kicking her out. Officer said she has any proof of that? She claimed she had some message which accidentally got deleted. 
  
Now the best part, Officer then asked her for an ID. She gave ID. Officer verified it over Radio. Suddenly, they told him this bitch had a failure to appear warrant for months old shoplifting case. Stupid lady was arrested immediately. His stuffs were send to friend's house. Officer said that I don't need to worry and they'll take care of her. I do not require any further action. 
  
So, Finally I'm relived from that squatter and bitch is behind bars. What a justice boner! 
 
All's well that ends well. :)
 
TL, DR: Previously there was bad cop, then comes good cop and justice is served. :)

She has told the social workers she wants to have us involved and will let us have her sometimes for visits and day trips and stuff when she is older and not a newborn. The issue I am having is the baby’s name. My cousin and her boyfriend seriously decided on the name 'Felony' for their daughter, with a middle name of 'Meth'. I am not trolling and not joking. This has actually happened. His mother doesn't want to change the name because she wants to 'respect' the name they chose. I don't want the kid's life screwed up forever because of this. I talked to the social workers on the case and they say they can’t do anything. I know there is no way they will give me custody or let me adopt at the moment and I wouldn’t want it because I’m not in a place to raise a baby properly right now.

weirdquestion11,2015-09-06 00:01:26+00:00,My neighbors didn't like the color of my house was so they had it painted a different color while I was out of town,"So this is a probably a really weird question for me to ask but it's a weird situation and I'm not really sure what I can do. My house is on a corner lot. Two years ago a newlywed couple moved in to the one house that’s beside mine. Right away they started making weird comments about the color my house was painted (yellow) and soon switched to outright demanding that I paint it a different color. My house was painted yellow when it was built it, I like the color and there is no bylaw against it or anything. They have called the police on me about it as well as the city, both of whom told them to pound sound because I hadn’t done anything wrong and there was nothing they could do. They also tried suing me in court (the suit was thrown out and they had to pay my legal fees) and getting our other neighbors together to form a Home Owner’s Association in the hopes eventually I could be forced to paint my house a different color. Our other neighbors also told them to pound sand and they have basically alienated themselves from everyone else in the neighborhood at this point. 

I recently had to go out of town for something. I was gone for two weeks. When I got back two days ago my house was gray. Seriously. I actually almost drove past it because I’m so used to my yellow house. I knew immediately who was responsible but when I went over and knocked on their door no one answered. I think the couple figured out that I was away and not just at work when they saw our neighbors collecting my mail for me, because I sure as hell never told them I was going away and I know my other neighbors hate them too and didn’t tell them. The neighbor from across the street came over and showed me pictures that he took of the painting company setting up and doing the work. He said he and another neighbor called the police but the painting company had a valid work order and had been paid so the police couldn’t do anything. He also told about it but because they were paid to do the work they said they had to do it to avoid being sued. I called the painting company to get a copy of the work order and it was in the name of a “Ms. Jane Smith” and was paid for in cash. A redheaded woman and her redheaded husband came to the company to hire them (my neighbors are both redheads) saying they would be out of town and would like their house painted while they were gone. They gave the painting company pictures of my house, taken from the street. 

I have a surveillance camera at my front and side doors and in my backyard because I work shifts and as a woman living alone I don’t want some stranger breaking into my house and waiting to ambush me when I get home. My neighbors never set foot on my property at any time so they can’t be charged with trespassing and they didn't do the painting (which was actually done properly). When I called the police they re-iterated that since the painters were hired, had a valid work order and were paid to do the job, they can’t be charged with trespassing because it was reasonable for them not to know and they were acting in good faith and didn’t cause any physical damage to the house. Also the neighbors can't be charged with trespassing or vandalism because they didn't come on my property or touch the house themselves. I don’t know if I can sue anyone because there was no actual damage or harm done to me or the house. My neighbors still have not answered their door or shown themselves. I am pissed off beyond belief because I liked my yellow house and I can’t believe how fucking crazy that they have been. I wish I could show a court or city council how psycho they have been over this. I want to know if I have any recourse or if I can do something to get them to pay to paint the house back to yellow. Does anyone know what I can do to get them to fix this and paint it back?

I was not given any notice, I have lived in this building for six years with no complaints, have always paid my rent on time, I just renewed my lease for a year in July and I already paid the rent for September. He said I wasn't getting my September rent or my deposit back because he had to pay to change the locks and for movers to come and get my furniture out of the apartment. There was also a bill for the rest of the outstanding costs with my stuff. He told me I had until night fall to get my stuff off the lawn or he would call the police. I did call the police but they said it was a 'civil' matter. He is also withholding my mail until I pay the outstanding bill he says I owe. 

One of my neighbors was nice enough to guard my stuff but someone made off with my TV and my cookware. I called a friend to come help me take my stuff since I didn’t want any more of it to get stolen.  I stayed at the friend’s place as well last night. I have proof that I paid the lease for the year and that my September rent was paid. I was never given any notice. I called the company that owns the building and despite speaking with three different people I was told they won’t intervene in a dispute between a tenant and a superintendent. A couple of neighbors have texted me that the woman now living in my apartment is pregnant and probably dating the superintendent. She told one of them she didn’t want to live on the top floor (where there are open apartments)  so her ‘hunny’ gave her this one instead. I have no idea what to do now because the police and the building owners won’t listen or help me, I’m practically homeless, some of my stuff was stolen and I can’t even get my mail.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/3jfghb/superintendent_left_all_my_stuff_and_a_bill_for/,legaladvice,4304,1574,
gavekeysimdan,2015-09-01 00:44:26+00:00,My landlord has given keys to my apartment to 7 other people to use the laundry.,"I am renting a single-family single-story house with a basement. The basement has a laundry room in it. I am the only inhabitant right now if that matters (though my SO will be joining me here in December). 

The landlord owns two other houses. One has 3 apartments and a laundry room. The other is a duplex with no laundry room. Previously the people who lived in both of those places all used the laundry room in the 3-apartment one which I believe had at least two washers and dryers. However there was recently a fire in the laundry room and the landlord is fixing it himself. He says it will take a long time to fix.

In the mean time he gave keys to 7 different people to my house so that they can go down into my basement and use the laundry machines that are there.   In fact I didn't even find out until I came home and heard someone down there. He's lucky he explained fast. I called the landlord and sure enough he says he gave keys to all his other residents ""temporarily"" but that he gave them explicit instructions to only go to the basement and no where else.  He says he has no other option because their leases say he is responsible for the washer and dryer for them to use, and he can't get their laundry room back in shape very fast, so he has no choice but have them use mine.

My lease doesn't say that I have exclusive use of the basement, but I thought it was implied, especially considering that to get to the basement you have to come in my entryway, through my living room, through my kitchen, through my back hall and then downstairs. To get to the laundry room you go through my office and family room. So that's someone walking all over my house basically.

The landlord says it will be ""maybe 3 months to half a year"" and can't give any more specifics.

What rights do I have? Am I screwed since the lease doesn't say he CAN'T do this?

If I DO have any rights how do I enforce them? Change the locks anyway?

Also I am in Iowa City, Iowa, if it matters.

Edit:  If it's not obvious I'm uncomfortable with this for a number of reasons. First of all because I like my privacy and don't want people walking through my house any time they want. Second because I own plenty of electronics and other valuables and I don't want to risk having them stolen (some of the people he gave keys to are not exactly upstanding citizens). In addition, 7 people doing laundry in my house starts to limit when I can use it myself - it has been 5 days so far and every single day when I have gotten home from work and gone to start a load, someone had laundry going.  So all of those reasons are why I feel this is inappropriate.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/3j5nte/my_landlord_has_given_keys_to_my_apartment_to_7/,legaladvice,1128,344,
oliviaelleparker,2015-08-07 21:08:46+00:00,"Strange girl claims she's house sitting for a tenant, not sure what to do (New Jersey)","My husband &amp; I are private landlords. One of our tenants, we'll call him James, left for a trip at the beginning of the summer and asked us to keep an eye on the house while he's gone. I drive passed 2-3 times a day and stop in every couple days to get mail, water his plants and check on things. I have his original house key to get in, but I also know where he keeps a spare key. 

Today my husband went over to mow and water the lawn. He used the key to enter so he could play XBox while the sprinkler went (with James's permission) and discovered another person in the house. He went back out and called me to ask if James had anyone staying there, I said no and came over to meet him. This time we knocked and the woman answered the door. I asked who she was, she said she was James's girlfriend and she was house sitting for the summer. 

We were immediately suspicious because we have been house sitting for 2 months and never seen this woman, even though I enter the house 2-3 times a week at least, and I've never seen anything indicating someone was living here. Also, James is backpacking out of the country with his boyfriend... While that doesn't necessarily mean he doesn't have a girlfriend, we know for a fact he's gay and in a committed relationship, so that makes this whole thing even more suspicious. 

She claimed James gave her a key. On our way out, hubby checked where James hides his spare key and it's missing when it was there on Wednesday, because I used it when I forgot the regular key. She has no proof she even knows James, we asked her if she had any photos or texts on her phone from James proving their relationship and she claimed she doesn't have a cell phone, but a pink studded iPhone was sitting on the coffee table (and wasn't there on Wednesday).

We can't get ahold of James to ask him what's up, it will be another 2 weeks before he calls to check in and he doesn't have reliable service. I left a message with his mom in case he calls her, and she said James has never mentioned a girlfriend to her, he's never had a girlfriend in his life and she's never heard of this girl. She thinks it could be an acquaintance looking for a free place to crash. She offered to sign anything (she has power of attorney for James) to get her out if necessary, but she lives 3 hours away. 

On one hand, it's not our business who James is seeing or invites to the house. On the other, we have a really bad feeling this girl is here illegally and looking for a free place to live, possibly even trying to steal stuff from the house. Right now the next door neighbors son is outside discreetly watching the house to report if she tries to steal furniture or anything, but so far all she's done is gone swimming and sun bathed in the backyard. 

What should we do? Hubby wants to call the police and make her prove she has permission, but I'm worried we might be overstepping as landlords. But I also don't want to do nothing and see James get robbed. She claims she's been there for weeks and she might try to say she's a tenant, too. What's the best way to handle this?

Edit: the neighbors son watching the house, he just texted "" Ms. Parker, I have areally bad feeling she's a stalker. James told my mom that if a girl who looked like her came around to tell him bc she's a troublemaker. And mom said she thinks she might be a stalker and to call police if we saw her./""

So apparently James might have a stalker and this woman fits the description of the woman they were told to watch out for. 

---------------------

Edit - Update:

We have no idea what is going on. We met the police at the next door neighbors house and explained the situation. They asked us a lot of questions about James, what we knew about the woman, pretty much normal questions. Then the questions got unceasingly weird, like, did the woman seem agitated or defensive, did she appear to be pregnant, did you see or hear an infant in the house, did you see any baby items laying around, did you notice anything unusual about her hair, did she have any visible birth marks or deformities, did she speak with an unusual accent, things that made no sense at all considering we thought this was a possible robbery. What is the purpose of these questions? 

The officers asked us to look at some photos and could we identify the woman, during this time other police officers arrived, there were 7-8 officers at this point, and 3 went over next door to talk to the woman while we stayed at the neighbors house. She answered the door right away, we couldn't make out what they were saying, but she seemed totally relaxed and happy, not upset or scared. They talked for maybe 15-20 minutes, then she stepped out on the porch and the officers arrested her pretty aggressively. 

They asked for permission to go through the house, which his mother gave by phone, and asked my husband to list any closets, storage or crawl spaces. They came back twice asking if there was an attic or a basement, and if we had done any recent work on the walls (we had) but they never explained why, or what they were looking for.  They also located her blue Ford Fuzion parked 3 houses down across the street, which they towed. 

They did recover the spare key on her person, but they instructed us to replace all of the locks on that key tonight, so we're getting ready to go to Home Depot right now while the neighbor's husband stays in the house. We're also going to look for security cameras. We did mention the possible stalking, but they didn't seem remotely interested in what the neighbor had to say about it. 

So we have no idea who this woman is, why she was really there, what the police were looking for, what the hell just happened, or what's going to happen next. One officer gave us a business card with his badge number and cell phone number, and wrote down s matter number on the back, so he said to expect a phone call in the next few days if they have any more questions. But they were very hush hush about what was going on and the only thing they would tell us is, it's an ongoing investigation and they can't release any information at this time. They won't even tell us if they think James or his boyfriend are involved. I am freaking the hell out right now. 

We tried contacting James and his boyfriend for the last few hours with no success. I left him a voicemail to call me back as soon as possible, but I didn't want to break the news by voicemail. Hopefully he calls me back soon. 

What happens next? What can we expect now? What happens if James was involved in this? I really don't think he is, but I don't know what to think right now. Tonight has been one big blur and I don't know what we should be doing right now.

aquatinne03,2015-07-09 02:17:47+00:00,My almost 3 month old daughter has been subpoenaed to testify in a criminal case,"Last Thursday a process server came to our house and served a subpoena for a criminal case on my daughter, who was born on April 15, 2015. I called the number on it to explain how it must be a mistake because my daughter is not even 3 months old yet but I was told there was no mistake and my daughter is required to appear as a witness to testify on the date shown on the subpoena. I went in person with my daughter to the DA’s office and was told the same thing. My husband and I thought this might be a case of identity theft. She doesn’t have a social security number yet because she was born at 29 weeks, spent 11 weeks in the NICU and has only been home from the hospital for 7 days so we haven’t gotten around to it yet. We checked anyway just in case and one has not be created for her or issued to her. Nothing with her credit either. We called the police about it possibly being identity theft and they are looking into it but so far there is nothing and they also told us the subpoena is legitimate.  So we are very confused. My daughter has a rare and uncommon first, middle and last name, so it is very doubtful that there someone else with her exact name. When I called the number on the subpoena and went to the DA’s office I was told both times that if she doesn’t show up for court a warrant will be issued for her arrest. Would the police actually arrest a baby for not showing up in court? Or would my husband and I as her parents be arrested instead? Does anyone have an explanation for what is happening here or any advice as to what we can do to solve this? I swear I'm not trolling, I wouldn't believe this myself except it is actually happening to us.

angrydad303,2015-07-04 15:40:01+00:00,"Adult employee at phone store looked up my 14 year old daughter's number and sent her multiple inappropriate text messages. When I complained and called police the store cancelled our TV, phones and internet.","My 14 year old daughter has been saving her money and got really good grades this year so as a reward I decided it was time to buy her a cell phone. We went to the store and she picked one out and paid some towards it while I paid the rest and added her to my account. The next day she got a couple of text messages from someone who was flirting with her and throwing out pick-up lines. At first she thought it was just a friend joking around because he phone was new and she didn’t have all their numbers, but the messages continued and so she answered for the first time and asked who it was. The person texted back his name and said he works “at the store and when I saw you I thought you were cute so I looked you up in the system to get your number”. She told him she was only 14 and to please stop texting her but he texted back “lying about being underage is something lots of girls do as a shit test”. He also told her that he was 19 and she looked like she was too, even though she doesn’t. She told him to stop again, and he continued to send messages saying the sexual things he wanted to do to her, telling her she should be flattered and not stuck up and asking to meet up. She told him she was going to tell her dad and call the police. At this point the messages stopped.  

She told me, I called the store, the manager said he didn’t do anything wrong and that I was overreacting and I should tell my daughter to stop being so flirty. She never did any such thing and didn’t even speak to this guy, I was with her the whole time. I called the police and they are investigating. However yesterday our cell phones, home phone, TV and internet stopped working. I borrowed my neighbor's phone to call the company and I was told that I cancelled my services with them. I did no such thing but the company rep and manager insisted that I had gone into a store in person and cancelled everything, the same store where I bought my daughter’s cell phone. I was also told I am now on the hook for a large fee since I cancelled everything without notice. I told them about the police investigation but they say without proof there is nothing they can do. Until this gets sorted out my daughter and I have to use the neighbor’s phone and Wi-Fi (with permission). My daughter is a bit freaked out that he knows our address since he said he looked up the account in the system. I won’t lie, I want to lay a beating on the guy but I’m not stupid so I’ll let the police handle it. Is what he did criminal and will he be charged? Do I have any legal recourse against the store or this guy? How do I address the cancellation, which I am sure was done on purpose in retaliation? We're in Minnesota.

**Edited to add:** I posted below but I want to make sure everyone sees this and knows how thankful I am for the responses and support:

Wow this really blew up. Thank-you everyone who took the time to reply. Someone mentioned it further down but the reason I haven't gone to the media is because the police are investigating. They took it very seriously and did not brush us off. They told me if I disclose details to the media or post on Facebook or Twitter it could jeopardize the case and I need to wait. I am fine to do that because I know they are investigating. My daughter found information on the people in charge online. She decided to write to them since this affected her directly. She explained the situation, how this made her feel having her privacy violated and how upset she was at being called too flirty simply by existing when she never even spoke to the guy. She included screenshots of all his text messages, a recording of my call to the manager where I was told I was overreacting and it was no big deal and my daughter was a flirt, a recording of my call to customer service where they informed me I had gone into the store to cancel, a copy of the police report and a copy of my work time sheet with verified by my boss which shows I was in another town during store hours on the day I supposedly went into the store to cancel. Thank god because I know nothing about taking screenshots and scanning things. I am also thankful my neighbor thought to make her cell phone return the calls to the store and customer service when she lent me her phone. Young people and technology.

My daughter emailed all this to a bunch of people in charge as well as to customer service. Basically every email she could get online. She also contacted the FCC. I am very proud of her for doing this. Part of me is also sad because I see how much she is growing up. It’s just her and me and I still think of her as a little girl. I wanted to go and bust heads and do whatever I could to protect her. But she told me she has to fight her own battles sometimes and she is right. I will keep everyone updated as much as I can.

chargedbutinnocent,2015-06-23 21:55:57+00:00,"Iowa - Two years ago I was accused of hitting a pedestrian and leaving the scene, and lost. Now by a crazy ridiculous miracle I found a video that shows it wasn't me.","Two years ago I (in my white car) was driving behind another white car. The car ahead of me ran a stop sign and hit a kid who was crossing the street. They immediately sped off.

Before I even got out of my car the kid's parents were outside running to him.  I called 911, told them I had called, and asked if there was anything I could do.  I told them everything I was able to remember about the car, which wasn't much - white sedan, and the direction the car went in.

I gave them my contact information in case the police needed anything from witnesses and then carried on (ironically when this happened I was on my way to the courthouse for court as a witness in a trial against a coworker, and since I was summoned to court I needed to get there.)

Somehow this all got turned around.  The kids said I was the person who hit the kid.  I was accused of running a stop sign, reckless driving and leaving the scene.  I pled not guilty but all the kids who witnessed it claimed otherwise.  I was found guilty.  I was fined, had to do community service, my insurance paid out for the kid's medical expenses.  In addition my insurance rate went up.

In a crazy turn of events I found security camera footage now (two years later) of the incident, which shows that the car ahead of me hit the child and not me. (The story - my sister walks dogs and asked me to fill in for her this week while she's out of town. I noticed the security camera on one guy's house and joked that it would have come in handy for me a couple of years ago.  By some miracle he still had security footage from the month of the incident because there was a string of vandalism. He had made a backup copy of the month's footage before the camera looped and over-wrote the hard drive, and had never gotten rid of it.)

RBradbury1920,2015-05-02 03:26:05+00:00,[MA] Post-it notes left in apartment.,"On the 15th of April I found a yellow post-it note in a handwriting that wasn't mine on my desk reminding me of some errands I had to do, but told literally nobody about. While odd, I chalked it up to something I did in my sleep, thinking maybe in my half-awake state I scrawled it so it didn't appear to be my handwriting. I threw it out and thought little of it.

On the 19th, I found another post it note on the back of my desk chair, in the same handwriting as the previous note, telling me to make sure I ""saved my documents"". I was  freaked out, but there were no other signs of a break-in, so I set up a web-cam in my house aimed at my desk and used a security-cam app for it to record after detecting movement.

On the 28th, I woke up to find another post-it note, this one saying, ""Our landlord isn't letting me talk to you, but it's important we do."" I immediately checked the webcam's folder on my computer and found nothing from the night before, but my computer's recycling bin had been emptied, which I am certain I did not do recently, indicating someone had noticed the webcam and deleted the files. (They were just saved straight to a folder on my desktop called ""Webcam"". 

Today, on the 1st of May, I found another post it note, this time on the outside of my door, with nothing written on it– and there also appeared to be post-its on many other doors in my apartment complex, all blank, in varying colors.

Do I have any legal recourse here? I have no proof except for the post-its, but those are written by my pen and on my post-it notes, so conceivably I could have faked them. Would contacting the police get me into any trouble, if they can't determine an outside source for this? I just want to make sure I'm not wasting anyone's time. 

Should I consult my landlord? Those also living in the complex?

Anyway, today the cops responded to a non threatening suspicious report from my neighbor(across the street), who drove to the police station (did not call) to tell them he thought someone was trying to break into his house earlier in the day. The police told him they would send a patrol car over. They sent a car over and they came to my house, the WRONG HOUSE. They entered my fenced in backyard, guns already out, without ringing the doorbell or knocking, my dog would go bark at the front door if they had rang the bell.(My neighbors were outside waiting for the police but the police just rushed into my backyard, across the street ignoring or not seeing my neighbors waving them down.) They entered my backyard without knocking on my door or anything. My dog(german shepherd) has a doggie door and he came out and started to bark at the cop and proceeded to do what he was meant to do, guard. My dog, Otto, came outside through the dog door and charged and barked at the cop. The cop shot him twice. I arrived home, from the mall shortly after, to the numerous police at my house. I ran immediately to backyard where I would find my dog bleeding in the corner being subdued by animal control after being shot. He was rushed to the nearest animal hospital, where the doctors tried to save him but unfortunately one bullet penetrated his heart. We contacted the local news and we were interviewed. I don't know what to do. I guess sue? Any help would be great. THE AREA I LIVE IN IS A SUBURBAN WHITE NEIGHBORHOOD, and with all this news about cops wrongfully shooting people in baltimore, Missouri, etc (NOT COMPARING) just thought shit is getting out of hand with all these trigger happy police.

knightsmarian,2014-12-29 01:12:12+00:00,Stuck in a restaurant and they will not let me leave.,"I am at Dinner with my SO, and we have been here a while. Dinner took an hour to get here. Food was subpar. As I was going to pay, the computers crashed and no payments could be made. They have held me for an additional hour and a half and people are getting angry. I am angry and very upset. People have threatened to call the cops. The manager has said that they would only keep us on the premises, as we would be stealing if we left. What should I do, what can I do? I do not have enough cash to cover the bill.

**Update:**
The Manager was physically barring the doors and preventing people from leaving. He denied new parties from entering and denied his existing patrons from leaving. Some times physically shoving some people and shouting rude things at others who were video taping or on their phones. Kids were present too, which is just kind of douchey.

 I asked for a Way for them to take my information and they said it was not in my interest as it could lead to credit card theft. (Learn to be a responsible business?) 

I called the cops and they arrived and talked to the manager first. He was stating how we (the patrons) were wanting to leave and trying to steal from him, that we were antagonizing him and that he wanted to press charges on all of us. 

The manager was then put aside and the cops talked to us (the patrons). We told them what happened and some of the other parties showed video of what was happening. The cops called back up and then arrested the manager for illegal detainment. The cops then asked us if we wanted to sign a paper if we would be willing to press charges. Most of us elected to do so. After that, contact info was collected, some videos were copied and we were free to go! There were around 13 parties of us effected by this. Probably 50 or so people, not including his staff.  

For those wondering about the location, it was a major restaurant chain in Central Florida. 

**Update 2:** I have a meeting at a law firm Monday afternoon. Several people have asked me to put the name of the company back on this post. If the law firm says it is okay to, along with the location, I will. I will inquire about videos as well and link if that is an option. As far as reporting to local news, I would rather not. The idea of being harassed by people, law firms and media is terrifying. I would rather that not be an issue. If someone else wants to take the limelight, go ahead. I don't want it. 

**Update 3:** Talked with the law firm Monday and there are a few other parties using this service as well. The lawyers have advised me from putting anymore information out on the web. Companies when presented with a lawsuit get really nitpicky with content to try and launch a counter sue. When they do that, they will contact the law firm and try to settle it out of court to ""have mercy"" on the afflicted party(ies). So I will not be releasing the name of the company or location any more specifically to prevent a defamation lawsuit. (Which can still happen even if I am being truthful but I just forgot something. See Nitpicky: above) As of now, everything is going great and we will be filing soon. Will update when the case is said and done with the outcome. Thank you all so much for the help. You guys are the best. :)

**Edit:** made the update more detailed, as per request. 

**Edit2:** Typos and formatting. 

**Final Edit June 8th, 2015:** I still receive a lot of PM's asking about the outcome of this. Here is what I can say. Myself and the other parties went to court. I cannot tell you the name of the establishment or the firm representing us, but I can say that it went very well (for us). I cannot divulge any specifics of the case either.

Alabama.,"I moved to rural Alabama a few months ago and signed a 1 year lease on a rental property. The lease explicitly states that dogs are allowed with a $300 per deposit. I paid the pet deposit and pay an extra $50/month to have my dog. The dog is a professionally trained service dog that I require due to my disability. I have all of its papers and the documentation proving it is a service dog. The landlord also has a copy of the registration papers. 

Like I said, it's a rural area so I have a large fenced in yard. The fence is 6 ft tall and it locks in front of the house. I let the dog out when I get home from work and the neighbors are over half a mile away. When I came home from work today, my dog was missing. She should have been inside like she always is. I asked my neighbor (we have the same landlord) if he had seen anything, and he told me he saw the landlord go into my house and remove the dog. He says he saw the dog in the back of her truck as she drove past his house. 

I called my landlord and asked if she had been in my house. She said she had been over to check on the electricity meter and the appliances. I told her that my dog was missing and that she was not allowed to enter my home without notice. She then denied that she had been over to my house. I demanded that she return my dog and she claimed that I had never had a dog, that dogs weren't allowed on the property, and that I had violated my lease. We ended up in a screaming match before I hung up. 

I am on the verge of calling the police, but I have no proof that anything happened. The only thing I know is that my dog is gone. I've only been home for two hours. 

**Edit/update:**after I posted this, I called my mom and had her drive over. After she arrived, we called the police and filed a report. A lot of you asked why I hesitated and it's because I've had police hassle me in the past, and I wasn't going to be alone with an officer without my dog or some backup. I'm wheelchair bound so I can't take any risks. 

After we filed the report, the police went to see the landlord, who lives in the area. The landlord's husband surrendered my dog and the dog was returned to me!!! I chose to press charges for trespassing and theft. Now SweetPea (the dog) is gnawing on some treats :)

I plan to move out ASAP. ",http://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/2k7vdw/my_landlord_had_my_service_dog_taken_away_and/,legaladvice,1847,617,
